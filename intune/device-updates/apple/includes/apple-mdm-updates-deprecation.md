<!-- This include file is used in the Apple software updates docs that mention MDM. -->

Apple has deprecated MDM‑based software update workloads. To align with this change, Microsoft Intune will soon end support for MDM‑based Apple software update policies. Microsoft recommends using declarative device management (DDM) to manage and install Apple software updates.
For more information about this transition, see the [Intune Customer Success blog: Move to declarative device management for Apple software updates](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/intunecustomersuccess/support-tip-move-to-declarative-device-management-for-apple-software-updates/4432177).
