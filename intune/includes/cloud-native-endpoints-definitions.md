<!-- This include file is used in the cloud native endpoint guides in /memdocs. -->

When reading about cloud native endpoints, you see the following terms:

- **Endpoint**: An endpoint is a device, like a mobile phone, tablet, laptop, or desktop computer. "Endpoints" and "devices" are used interchangeably.
- **Managed endpoints**: Endpoints that receive policies from the organization using an MDM solution or Group Policy Objects. These devices are typically organization owned, but can also be BYOD or personally owned devices.
- **Cloud native endpoints**: Endpoints that are joined to Microsoft Entra. They aren't joined to on-premises AD.
- **Workload**: Any program, service, or process.
