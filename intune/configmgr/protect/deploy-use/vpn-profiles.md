# VPN profiles in Configuration Manager

> [!IMPORTANT]

To deploy VPN settings to users in your organization, use VPN profiles in Configuration Manager. By deploying these settings, you minimize the end-user effort required to connect to resources on the company network.

For example, you want to configure all Windows 10 devices with the settings required to connect to a file share on the internal network. Create a VPN profile with the settings necessary to connect to the internal network. Then deploy this profile to all users that have devices running Windows 10. These users see the VPN connection in the list of available networks and can connect with little effort.

When you create a VPN profile, you can include a wide range of security settings. These settings include certificates for server validation and client authentication that you provision with Configuration Manager certificate profiles. For more information, see [Certificate profiles](introduction-to-certificate-profiles.md).

> [!Note]
> Configuration Manager doesn't enable this optional feature by default. You must enable this feature before using it. For more information, see [Enable optional features from updates](../../core/servers/manage/optional-features.md).<!--505213-->
