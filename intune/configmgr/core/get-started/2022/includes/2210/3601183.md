## <a name="bkmk_featured-apps-software-center"></a> Featured Apps in Software Center

<!--3601183-->
We're now adding a **Featured** tab in Software Center where we'll display featured apps. 
With the new tab, IT admin can mark apps as "featured" and encourage end users to use these apps. 
Currently, this feature is available only for "User Available" apps. 
Also, admins can make the **Featured** tab of Software Center as default the tab from Client Settings. 

If an app is marked as **Featured** and it's deployed to a User Collection as an Available app, it will show under the **Featured** pivot in Software Center.
