## <a name="bkmk_reports"></a> Improvements to Power BI Report Server Integration
<!--12487076-->

We've made the following improvements for Power BI Report Server integration:

- You can now use Microsoft Power BI Desktop (Optimized for Power BI Report Server) versions that were released after January 2021
- Configuration Manager now correctly handles Power BI reports saved by Power BI Desktop (optimized for Power BI Report Server) May 2021 or later.
   - Reports saved by Power BI Desktop (optimized for Power BI Report Server) May 2021 or later function in earlier versions of Configuration Manager. However, you might experience delays updating the data source on newly updated reports, or receive `The remote server returned an error; (400) Bad Request.` errors in the **SRSRP.log**. For more information about the relevant change to Power BI Desktop (optimized for Power BI Report Server) May 2021, see [Change data source connection strings in Power BI reports](/power-bi/report-server/connect-data-source-apis).
