## <a name="bkmk_tsmedia"></a> Improved notice for content on task sequence media

<!--12895956-->

When you create task sequence media in the Configuration Manager console, you have to select distribution points that contain the content required by the task sequence. If some content isn't available on the selected distribution points, the wizard would display an error that simply said some packages aren't available.

Based on your feedback, this message now includes the list of package IDs for the content that's not available. This change makes the notice more actionable, so you can more easily see what content is missing. This information is also listed in the CreateTsMedia.log file.
