## <a name="bkmk_improvements-to-the-console"></a> Improvements to the console

<!--14908615-->

When performing a search on any node in the console, the hint text in the search bar will now indicate the scope of the search.
- By default, all subfolders are searched when you perform a search in any node that contains subfolders. You can narrow down the search by selecting the “Current Node” option from the search toolbar.
- If you want to expand the search to include all nodes, then select the “All Objects” button in the ribbon.
  
For more information, see [Console changes and tips](../../../../servers/manage/admin-console-tips.md).
