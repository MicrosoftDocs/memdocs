## <a name="bkmk_audit-admin-service"></a> Authorization failure message in admin service now shown in Status message viewer

<!--13022894-->

Audit messages about authorization failure have been introduced in admin service. You can now view request details and status messages. These messages are shown in “All Status Message” at “Status Message Queries” in “Monitoring” ribbon. Previously these failures were logged in log files. 

With the new audit messages we intend to avoid inconvenience of log files rollback. Details about the user, resource access attempts and the number of attempts for all the authorized requests made by user in a day will now be available. We're also auditing read operations for HTTPS requests and for cloud-initiated operations. This helps admins to scope permission and roles of users while also determining if there are any malicious users.

For more information, see [Administration Service documentation](../../../../../develop/adminservice/overview.md).
