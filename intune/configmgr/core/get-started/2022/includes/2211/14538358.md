## <a name="bkmk_naa-account"></a> Network Access Account (NAA) account usage alert  

<!--14538358-->

Network Access Account (NAA) account usage alert

If your site is configured with NAA account, you'll see this new prerequisite warning added. To improve the security of distribution points configured with NAA account, review the existing accounts and their relevant permissions. If it has more than minimal required permission, then remove and add a minimal permission account. Don't configure any administrator level permission accounts on the NAA. If the site server is configured with HTTPS / EHTTP, we recommend removing NAA account, which is unused.


For more information, see the description of this [permissions-for-the-network-access-account](../../../../plan-design/hierarchy/accounts.md#permissions-for-the-network-access-account).
