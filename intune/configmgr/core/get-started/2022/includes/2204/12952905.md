## <a name="bkmk_administration"></a> Administration Service Management option
<!--12952905-->
When configuring Azure Services, a new option called **Administration Service Management** is now added for enhanced security. Selecting this option allows administrators to segment their admin privileges between [cloud management gateway (CMG)](../../../../clients/manage/cmg/overview.md) and [administration service](../../../../../../configmgr/develop/adminservice/overview.md). By enabling this option, access is restricted to only administration service endpoints. Configuration Management clients will authenticate to the site using Microsoft Entra ID.

### Try it out!

Try to complete the tasks. Then send [Feedback](../../../../understand/product-feedback.md) with your thoughts on the feature.

Generate a Microsoft Entra token and call the administration service by using a PowerShell script. The sample script and details can be found in the [Microsoft/configmgr-hub GitHub repository](https://aka.ms/cmadminservicetokensample).
