## <a name="bkmk_adr"></a> ADR scheduling improvements for deployments
<!--12707738, 7033417-->
The **Software available time** and **Installation deadline** for deployments created by an [automatic deployment rule (ADR)](../../../../../sum/deploy-use/automatically-deploy-software-updates.md) are now calculated based on the time the ADR evaluation is scheduled and starts. Previously, these times were calculated based on when the ADR evaluation completed. This change makes the  **Software available time** and **Installation deadline** consistent and predictable for deployments.
