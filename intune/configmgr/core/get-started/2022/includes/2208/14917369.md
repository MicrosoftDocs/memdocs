## <a name="bkmk_improvements-to-the-dark-theme"></a> Dark theme is now extended to more dashboards

<!--14917369, 14959592, 14969236-->

In this release, the dark theme has been extended to more dashboards, which previously didn't display the dark theme correctly. For example, the Office 365 Updates Dashboard, PCM Dashboard, and Health Attestation dashboard will now display according to the dark theme, when it's enabled.

Enable this prerelease feature to experience the dark theme. For more information, see [Dark theme for the console.](../../../../../core/servers/manage/admin-console.md)
