## <a name="bkmk_enable-intune"></a> Intune role-based access control (RBAC) for tenant attached devices

<!--8126836-->

You can now use Intune role-based access control (RBAC) when interacting with tenant attached devices from the Microsoft Intune admin center. 
For example, when using Intune as the role-based access control authority, a user with Intune's [Help Desk Operator role](../../../../../../intune-service/fundamentals/role-based-access-control.md#built-in-roles) doesn't need an assigned security role or additional permissions from Configuration Manager.
For more information, see [Intune role-based access control for tenant attached clients.](../../../../../cloud-attach/use-intune-rbac.md)
