## Configuration Manager update database upgrade monitoring

When applying a Configuration Manager update, you can now see the state of the **Upgrade ConfigMgr database** task in the  installation status window.

- If the database upgrade is blocked, then you're given the warning **In progress, needs attention**.
   - The cmupdate.log logs the program name and sessionid from SQL Server that is blocking the database upgrade.
- When the database upgrade is no longer blocked, the status is reset to **In progress** or **Complete**.
   - When the database upgrade is blocked, a check is done every 5 minutes to see if it's still blocked.
