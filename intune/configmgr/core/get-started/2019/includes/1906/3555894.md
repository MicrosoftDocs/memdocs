## Improvements to maintenance tasks

Site server maintenance tasks can now be viewed and edited from their own tab on the details view of a site server. The new **Maintenance Tasks** tab gives you information such as:

- If the task is enabled
- The task schedule
- Last start time
- Last completion time
- If the task completed successfully

### Try it out!

Try to complete the tasks. Then send [Feedback](../../../../understand/product-feedback.md) with your thoughts on the feature.
