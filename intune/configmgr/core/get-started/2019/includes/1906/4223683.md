## <a name="bkmk_console"></a> Improvements to Configuration Manager console

<!--4223683-->

You can now enable some nodes of the Configuration Manager console to use the administration service. This change allows the console to communicate with the SMS Provider over HTTPS instead of via WMI.

In this version, it only affects the following nodes under the **Security** node in the **Administration** workspace:

- Administrative Users
- Security Roles
- Security Scopes
- Console Connections

### Prerequisite

Enable the administration service. For more information, see [Administration service](../../../../plan-design/hierarchy/plan-for-the-sms-provider.md#administration-service).

### Try it out!

Try to complete the tasks. Then send [Feedback](../../../../understand/product-feedback.md) with your thoughts on the feature.

1. In the Configuration Manager console, go to the **Administration** workspace, expand **Site Configuration**, and select the **Sites** node. In the ribbon, select **Hierarchy Settings**.

1. On the **General** page, select the option to **Enable the Configuration Manager console to use the administration service**.
