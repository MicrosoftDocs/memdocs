## New Windows 10, version 1903 and later product category
<!--4682946-->

**Windows 10, version 1903 and later** was added to Microsoft Update as its own product rather than being part of the **Windows 10**  product like earlier versions. This change caused you to do a number of manual steps to ensure that your clients see these updates. We've helped reduce the number of manual steps you have to take for the new product.

When you update to 1906 technical preview and have the **Windows 10** product selected for synchronization, the following actions occur automatically:

- The **Windows 10, version 1903 and later** product is added for synchronization.
- Automatic Deployment Rules containing the **Windows 10** product will be updated to include **Windows 10, version 1903 and later**.
- [Servicing plans](../../../../../osd/deploy-use/manage-windows-as-a-service.md) are updated to include the **Windows 10, version 1903 and later** product.
