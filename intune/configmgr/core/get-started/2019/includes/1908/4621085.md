## <a name="bkmk_tssearch"></a> Improvements to task sequence editor search

<!--4621085-->

This release includes the following improvements to the version 1907 feature to [search the task sequence editor](../../technical-preview-1907.md#bkmk_tsedit):

- The list of search options is now named **Scope**. Use it to choose the areas of the task sequence editor to search. You can now use **Alt** + **Down arrow** to open this list.

- Instead of scoping the search to the **Group**, you can now search on **Group Name** or **Group Description**.
