## <a name="bkmk_sedo"></a> Reclaim lock for editing task sequences
<!--3699337-->

If the Configuration Manager console stops responding, you can be locked out of making further changes until the lock expires after 30 minutes. This lock is part of the Configuration Manager SEDO (Serialized Editing of Distributed Objects) system. For more information, see [Configuration Manager SEDO](../../../../../develop/core/understand/sedo.md).

Based on your feedback, now you can clear your lock on a task sequence. This action only applies to your user account that has the lock, and on the same device from which the site granted the lock. When you attempt to access a locked task sequence, you can now **Discard Changes**, and continue editing the object. These changes would be lost anyway when the lock expired.
