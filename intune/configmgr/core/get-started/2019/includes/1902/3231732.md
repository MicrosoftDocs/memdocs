## <a name="bkmk_rcmulti"></a> View first screen only during remote control
<!--3231732-->

When connecting to a client with two or more monitors, it can be difficult to view them all in the Configuration Manager remote control viewer. Based on your feedback, a remote tools operator can now choose between seeing **All screens** or the **First screen** only. 

The *first screen* is at the top and far left as shown in Windows display settings. You can't select a specific screen. When you switch the configuration of the viewer, reconnect the remote session. The viewer saves your preference for future connections. 


### Try it out!

Try to complete the tasks. Then send [Feedback](../../../../understand/product-feedback.md) with your thoughts on the feature.

1. [Start a remote control session](../../../../clients/manage/remote-control/remotely-administer-a-windows-client-computer.md).  

2. In the Configuration Manager Remote Control viewer, go to the **View** menu, select **Display**, and then switch from **All Screens** to **First Screen**.
