## <a name="bkmk_cmgbg"></a> Add cloud management gateway to boundary groups
<!--3640932-->

You can now associate a cloud management gateway (CMG) with a boundary group. This configuration allows clients to default or fallback to the CMG for client communication according to boundary group relationships. This behavior is especially useful in branch office and VPN scenarios. You can direct client traffic away from expensive and slow WAN links to instead use faster services in Microsoft Azure.


### Prerequisites

- [Configure boundary groups](../../../../servers/deploy/configure/boundary-groups.md)
- [Set up a CMG](../../../../clients/manage/cmg/setup-cloud-management-gateway.md)


### Try it out!

Try to complete the tasks. Then send [Feedback](../../../../understand/product-feedback.md) with your thoughts on the feature.

When you [create or configure a boundary group](../../../../servers/deploy/configure/boundary-group-procedures.md), on the **References** tab, add a cloud management gateway. This action associates the CMG with this boundary group.
