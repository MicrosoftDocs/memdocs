## <a name="bkmk_swctr"></a> Configure default views in Software Center
<!--3612112-->

This version of Configuration Manager further iterates on how you can customize Software Center:
 
- Set the default layout of applications, either as tiles or a list  

    - If a user changes this configuration, Software Center persists the user's preference in the future  

- Configure the default application filter, either all or only required apps  

    - Software Center always uses your default setting. Users can change this filter, but Software Center doesn't persist their preference.    

Specify these settings in client settings. Choose the **Software Center** group, and then select **Customize**. To configure the visibility of tabs, go to the **Tabs** tab. To configure the Software Center defaults, go to the **Defaults** tab. 

For more information, see [About client settings](../../../../clients/deploy/about-client-settings.md#software-center).
