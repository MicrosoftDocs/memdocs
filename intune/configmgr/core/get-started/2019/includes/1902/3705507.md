## <a name="bkmk_psedit"></a> Edit or copy PowerShell scripts
<!--3705507-->

You can now **Edit** or **Copy** an existing PowerShell script used with the [Run Scripts](../../../../../apps/deploy-use/create-deploy-scripts.md) feature. Instead of recreating a script that you need to change, now directly edit it. Both actions use the same wizard experience as when you create a new script. When you edit or copy a script, Configuration Manager doesn't persist the approval state. 

> [!Tip]  
> Don't edit a script that's actively running on clients. They won't finish running the original script, and you may not get the intended results from these clients.
