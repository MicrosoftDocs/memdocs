## <a name="bkmk_micoll"></a> Management insight rules for collections
<!--3555752-->

[Management insights](../../../../servers/manage/management-insights.md) has new rules with recommendations on managing collections. Use these insights to simplify management and improve performance. 


The following rules are in the **Collections** group:

- **Collections with no query rules and no direct members**: To simplify the list of collections in your hierarchy, delete these collections.  

- **Collections with the same re-evaluation start time**: These collections have the same re-evaluation time as other collections. Modify the re-evaluation time so they don't conflict.  

- **Collections with query time over two seconds**: Review the query rules for this collection. Consider modifying or deleting the collection.

- The following rules include configurations that potentially cause unnecessary load on the site. Review these collections, then either delete them, or disable rule evaluation:  

    - **Collections with no query rules and incremental updates enabled**  

    - **Collections with no query rules and enabled for scheduled or incremental evaluation**  

    - **Collections with no query rules and schedule full evaluation selected**
