## <a name="bkmk_feedback"></a> Confirmation of console feedback
<!--3556010-->

When you send [feedback](../../../../understand/product-feedback.md) in the Configuration Manager console, it now shows a confirmation message. This message includes a **Feedback ID**, which you can give to Microsoft as a tracking identifier. 

To copy the feedback ID, select the copy icon next to the feedback ID, or use the **CTRL** + **C** key shortcut. This ID isn't stored on your computer, so make sure to copy it before closing the window.
