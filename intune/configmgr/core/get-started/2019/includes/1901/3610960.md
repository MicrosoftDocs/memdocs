## <a name="bkmk_cmpivot"></a> Run CMPivot from the central administration site
<!--3610960-->

Configuration Manager now supports running CMPivot from the central administration site in a hierarchy. 

> [!Note]  
> This option can't be used with this release due to the technical preview limit of a single primary site.  

The primary site still handles the communication to the client. When running CMPivot from the central administration site, it communicates with the primary site over the high-speed message subscription channel. This communication doesn't rely upon standard SQL Server replication between sites. 

For more general information, see [CMPivot for real-time data](../../../../servers/manage/cmpivot.md).

> [!Tip]  
> You could previously run scripts from a central administration site. With this improvement, scripts also use the high-speed message subscription channel. The primary site quickly receives the message and notifies the client to run the script. This behavior reduces the time delay for running a script on a client from the central administration site.

> For more general information on scripts, see [Create and run PowerShell scripts from the Configuration Manager console](../../../../../apps/deploy-use/create-deploy-scripts.md).
