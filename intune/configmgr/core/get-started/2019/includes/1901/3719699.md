## <a name="bkmk_index"></a> Import a single index of an OS image
<!--3719699-->

When importing a Windows image (WIM) file to Configuration Manager, you can now specify to automatically import a single index rather than all image indexes in the file. This option provides the following benefits:

- Smaller image file  
- Faster offline servicing  
- [Optimize image servicing](#bkmk_resetbase), for a smaller image file after offline servicing  


### Try it out!

Try to complete the tasks. Then send [Feedback](../../../../understand/product-feedback.md) with your thoughts on the feature.

1. [Add an OS image](../../../../../osd/get-started/manage-operating-system-images.md#BKMK_AddOSImages).  

2. On the **Data Source** page, select the option to **Extract a specific image index from the specified WIM file**. Then select the image index from the list.  

3. Complete the wizard.

Configuration Manager doesn't modify the source image file. It creates a new image file in the same source directory.
