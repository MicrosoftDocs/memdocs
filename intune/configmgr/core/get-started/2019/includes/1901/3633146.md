## <a name="bkmk_osd"></a> Improvements to OS deployment
<!--3633146,3641475,3654172,3734270-->

This technical preview version includes the following improvements to OS deployment:

- Based on your feedback, there's a new **View** action on task sequences. <!--3633146-->  

- Based on your feedback, the task sequence error dialog window now displays more information. It shows the name of the task sequence step that failed. <!--3641475-->  

- When you set the **OSDDoNotLogCommand** task sequence variable to true, now it also hides the command line from the Run Command Line step in the log file. It previously only masked the program name from the Install Package step in smsts.log.<!--3654172-->  

- When you enable a PXE responder on a distribution point without Windows Deployment Service, it can now be on the same server as the DHCP service. Add the following settings to support this configuration:<!--3734270-->  
    - Set the DWord value **DoNotListenOnDhcpPort** to `1` in the following registry key: `HKLM\Software\Microsoft\SMS\DP`. 
    - Set DHCP option 60 to `PXEClient`.  
    - Restart the SCCMPXE and DHCP services on the server.
