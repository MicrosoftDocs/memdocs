<!--4561024-->
The all-new Microsoft Edge is ready for business. You can now deploy [Microsoft Edge, version 77 and later](/deployedge/) to your users. Admins can pick the Beta or Dev channel, along with a version of the Microsoft Edge client to deploy. Each release incorporates learnings and improvements from our customers and community.

### Prerequisites

|`http://dl.delivery.mp.microsoft.com`|Content for Microsoft Edge releases, version 77 and later|

Clients targeted with a Microsoft Edge, version 77 and later deployment:

- PowerShell [Execution Policy](/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_execution_policies) can't be set to Restricted.
  - PowerShell is executed to perform the installation.


### Log files

1. On the **Microsoft Edge Settings** page, you select a channel and version to deploy. The Learn More link takes you to the [Microsoft Edge Insiders page](https://www.microsoftedgeinsider.com/).
