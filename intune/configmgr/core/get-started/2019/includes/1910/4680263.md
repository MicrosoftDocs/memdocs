## <a name="bkmk_osdvar"></a> New variable for Windows 10 in-place upgrade

<!--4680263-->

Some customers have reported timing issues with the Window 10 in-place upgrade task sequence on high performance devices when Windows setup is complete:

- The TSManager component records entries similar to the following errors in the **smsts.log**:

    ``` log
    Failed to initate policy evaluation for namespace 'root\ccm\policy\machine', hr=0x80041010
    Error compiling client config policies. code 80041010
    Task Sequence Manager could not initialize Task Sequence Environment. code 80041010
    ```

- Windows setup records entries similar to the following errors in the **setupcomplete.log**:

    ``` log
    Running C:\windows\CCM\\TSMBootstrap.exe to resume task sequence
    ERRORLEVEL = -1073741701
    TSMBootstrap did not request reboot, resetting registry
    Exiting setupcomplete.cmd
    ```

To address these issues, you can now set a new task sequence variable **SetupCompletePause**. When you assign a value in seconds to this variable, the Windows setup process delays that amount of time before it starts the task sequence. This timeout provides the Configuration Manager client additional time to initialize. The specific timeout value will vary depending upon the hardware. A conservative value of `30` or `60` seconds generally resolves the issue, but a shorter timeout may work in your environment.
