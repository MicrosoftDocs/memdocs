OneTrace works with many types of log files, such as:

- Configuration Manager client logs
- Configuration Manager server logs
- Status messages
- Windows Update ETW log file on Windows 10
- Windows Update log file on Windows 7 & Windows 8.1

### Prerequisites

### Install

Find the Support Center installer on the site server at the following path: `cd.latest\SMSSETUP\Tools\SupportCenter\SupportCenterInstaller.msi`.

> [!Note]  
> Support Center and OneTrace use Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF). This component isn't available in Windows PE. Continue to use CMTrace in boot images with task sequence deployments.
