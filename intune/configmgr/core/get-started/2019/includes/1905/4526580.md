## <a name="bkmk_smbios"></a> View SMBIOS GUID in device lists

<!--4526580-->

In both the Devices and Device Collections nodes, you can now add a new column for **SMBIOS GUID**. This value is the same as the **BIOS GUID** property of the System Resource class. It's a unique identifier for the device hardware.
