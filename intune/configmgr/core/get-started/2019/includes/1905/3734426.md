## <a name="bkmk_timeout"></a> Configure the default maximum run time for software updates

<!--3734426-->

You can now specify the maximum amount of time a software update installation has to complete. You can specify the maximum run time for the following:

- **Feature updates** - An update that is in one of these three classifications:
    - Upgrades
    - Update rollups
    - Service packs

- **Non-feature updates** - An update that isn't a feature upgrade and whose product is listed as one of the following:
    - Windows 10 (all versions)
    - Windows Server 2012
    - Windows Server 2012 R2
    - Windows Server 2016
    - Windows Server 2019
    - Microsoft 365

All other products and classifications are not configurable with this setting. If you need to change the maximum run time of one of these updates, [configure the software update settings](../../../../../sum/get-started/manage-settings-for-software-updates.md#BKMK_SoftwareUpdatesSettings)
