## <a name="bkmk_ehttp"></a> Improvement to enhanced HTTP
<!--3798957-->

You can now enable [enhanced HTTP](../../../../plan-design/hierarchy/enhanced-http.md) per primary site or for the central administration site. This change provides better support for features that require it. For example, [app approvals via email](../../../../../apps/deploy-use/app-approval.md#bkmk_email-approve) or [viewing recently connected consoles](../../technical-preview-1901.md#bkmk_console).

To enable enhanced HTTP for the central administration site:

1. In the Configuration Manager console, go to the **Administration** workspace.  

2. Expand **Site Configuration** and select the **Sites** node.  

3. Select the central administration site server, and choose **Properties** in the ribbon.  

4. On the General tab, select the option to **Use Configuration Manager-generated certificates for HTTP site systems**.  

> [!Tip]  
> This action only enables enhanced HTTP for the SMS Provider roles at the central administration site. It's not a global setting that applies to all sites in the hierarchy. To enable enhanced HTTP at a primary site, see [Configure the site](../../../../plan-design/hierarchy/enhanced-http.md#configure-the-site).
