## <a name="bkmk_osd"></a> Improvements to OS deployment
<!--2839943,4447680-->

This release includes the following improvements to OS deployment:

- Based on your feedback, the following two PowerShell cmdlets to create and edit the [Run Task Sequence](../../../../../osd/understand/task-sequence-steps.md#child-task-sequence) step:  

    - **New-CMTSStepRunTaskSequence**

    - **Set-CMTSStepRunTaskSequence**

- Based on your feedback, a new task sequence variable, **SMSTSRebootDelayNext**. Use this new variable with the existing [SMSTSRebootDelay](../../../../../osd/understand/task-sequence-variables.md#SMSTSRebootDelay) variable. If you want any later reboots to happen with a different timeout than the first, set SMSTSRebootDelayNext to a different value in seconds.

    For example, you want to give users a 60-minute reboot notification at the start of a Windows 10 in-place upgrade task sequence. After that first long timeout, you want additional timeouts to only be 60 seconds. Set SMSTSRebootDelay to `3600`, and SMSTSRebootDelayNext to `60`.
