## <a name="bkmk_osd"></a> Improved language support in task sequence

<!--5411057-->

Starting in [technical preview version 1908.2](../../technical-preview-1908-2.md#bkmk_osd), you could specify the default keyboard layout (**Input locale**) during OS deployment. This release adds further control over language configuration during this process. If you're already applying these language settings, this change can help you simplify your OS deployment task sequence. Instead of using multiple steps per language or separate scripts, use one instance per language of the built-in **Apply Windows Settings** step with a condition for that language.

Use the **Apply Windows Settings** task sequence step to configure the following new settings:

- System locale
- UI language
- UI language fallback
- User locale

For more information on these Windows setup answer file values, see [Microsoft-Windows-International-Core](/windows-hardware/customize/desktop/unattend/microsoft-windows-international-core).

Use the following task sequence variables to control these international settings in the **Apply Windows Settings** step:

- OSDWindowsSettingsInputLocaleOverride
- OSDWindowsSettingsSystemLocaleOverride
- OSDWindowsSettingsUserLocaleOverride
- OSDWindowsSettingsUILanguageOverride
- OSDWindowsSettingsUILanguageFallbackOverride
- OSDTimeZoneOverride
