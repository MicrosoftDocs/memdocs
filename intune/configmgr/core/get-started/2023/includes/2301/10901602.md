## <a name="bkmk_msfb"></a>Removing Microsoft Store for Business and Education new config capability

<!--10901602-->

As part of Microsoft Store for Business deprecation, we are making these changes to the customer experience with using this feature: 

- Removing a user's ability to create new Microsoft Store for Business in Configuration Manager. 

- Display a warning message box when user triggers a sync from Microsoft Store for Business. 

- Display a warning in the Create Application Wizard when user attempts to create a new app from Store license information.
