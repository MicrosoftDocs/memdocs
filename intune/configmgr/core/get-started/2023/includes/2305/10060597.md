## <a name="bkmk_Notification"></a> Enhancing security for External service notifications URL 

<!-- This is an include file and is included in a page which has an H1 heading -->

<!--10060597-->
This feature avoids the risk of directing the subscription logic to an untrusted URL, resulting in information leakage. The upgrade prevents information from being sent to an HTTPS URL with an untrusted certificate. This method ensures that the data is protected by a trusted SSL certificate. For a secure connection, we recommend using SSL certificates from trusted Certification Authorities. This security feature only allows connections to URLs that have trusted certificates for enhanced security.
