## <a name="bkmk_ASR"></a> Attack Surface Reduction (ASR) capability now marks Server SKU as compliant only after enforcement

<!--9217349-->
Prior to the Attack Surface Reduction capability in Windows Server, rules were marked compliant by default. As this rule setting becomes available to Server SKU, the rule setting is enforced through Config Manager. Now the Server SKU will be marked as compliant for an Attack Surface Reduction rule, only after enforcement of the rule.
