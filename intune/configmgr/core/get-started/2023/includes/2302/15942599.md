## <a name="bkmk_dark"></a> Dark theme extended to delete secondary site wizard

<!--15942599-->
The Configuration Manager console now extends the dark theme for the delete secondary site wizard. This wizard will also have a new look for the normal theme. This is part of the ongoing effort to make dark theme and overall admin console experience better. 

:::image type="content" source="../../media/15942599-console-dark-theme.png" alt-text="Screenshot of dark theme for the delete secondary site wizard.":::

To use the theme, select the arrow from the top left of the ribbon, then choose **Switch console theme**. Select **Switch console theme** again to return to the light theme. 


### Known issue

Console restart is required on doing the theme switch, as the node navigation pane might not properly render when you move to a new workspace.
