<!--16834520-->

To learn more about the settings: “Enable Windows features introduced via Windows servicing that are off by default”, please read this [blog](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/windows-it-pro-blog/commercial-control-for-continuous-innovation/ba-p/3737575). The post describes the Commercial control for continuous innovation in Windows. The setting for this policy is now integrated with the Configuration Manager 2302 Technical Preview. More information on the Commercial control timeline and versions of Windows 11 supported by the setting can be found in the blog. 

The Windows features that the policy will control will be released in later part of 2023. This ConfigMgr Technical Preview feature is for awareness and not for testing in February 2023.
