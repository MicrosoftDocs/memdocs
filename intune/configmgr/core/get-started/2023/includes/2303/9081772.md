## <a name="bkmk_SQlodbc"></a> Prerequisites for the site server roles now include ODBC driver for SQL Server

<!--9081772-->

Starting with technical preview 2303, Configuration Manager requires the installation of the ODBC driver for 
SQL server as a prerequisite. This prerequisite is required when you create a new site or update an existing one. 

Configuration Manager doesn't manage the updates for the ODBC driver. Ensure that this component is up to date.
