# Features in Configuration Manager technical preview version 2301

*Applies to: Configuration Manager (technical preview branch)*

This article introduces the features that are available in the technical preview for Configuration Manager, version 2301. Install this version to update and add new features to your technical preview site.<!-- baseline only statement: When you install a new technical preview site, this release is also available as a baseline version.-->

Review the [technical preview](../technical-preview.md) article before installing this update. That article familiarizes you with the general requirements and limitations for using a technical preview, how to update between versions, and how to provide feedback.

The following sections describe the new features to try out in this version:

<!-- [!INCLUDE [Example feature name](includes/2201/1234567.md)] -->

[!INCLUDE [Microsoft Configuration Manager product branding ](includes/2301/15885998.md)]
[!INCLUDE [Improvements to Cloud Sync (Collections to AAD Group Sync) feature](includes/2301/14716797.md)]
[!INCLUDE [Update to the default value of supersedence age in months for software updates.](includes/2301/16441147.md)]
[!INCLUDE [Removing Microsoft Store for Business and Education new config capability.](includes/2301/10901602.md)]

## General known issues
<!--16822959-->
Update to the default value of supersedence age in months for software updates.

Removing SUP role in Admin Console does not reset the supersedence age property in WMI. As a result, while reconfiguring the role, the previously configured value is shown in the configuration window. This property needs to be reset to default value on role removal.
<!--  [!INCLUDE [11018755](includes/2112/known-issue-11018755.md)] -->

## Other Updates
<!--15358429-->
Offset for recurring monthly maintenance window schedules.
Based upon your feedback, you can now offset monthly maintenance window schedules to better align deployments with the release of monthly security updates. For example, using a maximum offset of seven days after the second Tuesday of the month, sets the maintenance window for next Monday.
