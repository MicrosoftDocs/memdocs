## <a name="bkmk_notify"></a> Configuration Manager console notifications
<!--1318035-->
To keep you better informed so that you can take the appropriate action, the Configuration Manager console now notifies you for the following events:
- When an update is available for Configuration Manager itself
- When lifecycle and maintenance events occur in the environment

This notification is a bar at the top of the console window below the ribbon. It replaces the previous experience when Configuration Manager updates are available. These in-console notifications still display critical information, but don't interfere with your work in the console. You can't dismiss critical notifications. The console displays all notifications in a new notification area of the title bar.

The following notifications are most applicable to the technical preview branch:  

- Evaluation version is within 30 days of expiration (Warning): the current date is within 30 days of the expiration date of the evaluation version  

- Evaluation version is expired (Critical): the current date is past the expiration date of the evaluation version  

- Console version mismatch (Critical): the console version doesn't match the site version  

- Site upgrade is available (Warning): there's a new update package available  


You can configure each site to show non-critical notifications. In the properties of the site, on the **Alerts** tab, select the option to **Enable console notifications for non-critical site health changes**. 

- If you enable this setting, all console users see critical, warning, and information notifications. This setting is enabled by default.  

- If you disable this setting, console users only see critical notifications.  

Most console notifications are per session. The console evaluates queries when a user launches it. To see changes in the notifications, restart the console. If a user dismisses a non-critical notification, it notifies again when the console restarts if it's still applicable. 

The following notifications reevaluate every five minutes:
- Site is in maintenance mode  
- Site is in recovery mode  
- Site is in upgrade mode  

Notifications follow the permissions of role-based administration. For example, if a user doesn't have permissions to see Configuration Manager updates, they won't see those notifications.

Some notifications have a related action. For example, if the console version doesn't match the site version, select **Install the new console version**. This action launches the console installer. 

For more information and troubleshooting assistance, see the **SmsAdminUI.log** file on the console computer. By default, this log file is at the following path: `C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Endpoint Manager\AdminConsole\AdminUILog\SmsAdminUI.log`.
