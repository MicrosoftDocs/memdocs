## <a name="bkmk_opmdm"></a> An Intune connection is no longer required for on-premises MDM
<!--1359124-->
The on-premises MDM prerequisite to configure a Microsoft Intune subscription is no longer required. Your organization still requires Intune licenses to use this feature. 

You can now use Configuration Manager to manage Surface Hub devices without requiring an Intune connection.
