## <a name="bkmk_sum-mw"></a> Improvement to maintenance windows for software updates
<!--vso2839307-->

If a device has more than one maintenance window applied, the client may ignore some windows. 

For example:

- All deployment maintenance window: 02:00 - 04:00
- Software updates maintenance window: 04:00 - 06:00

The client only installs software updates during the second maintenance window. It ignores the maintenance window for all deployments in this scenario.

Starting in this technical preview version, the following client setting is in the **Software Updates** group to control this behavior: 

**Enable installation of updates in "All deployments" maintenance window when "Software update" maintenance window is available**

By default, this option is **No** to keep consistent with the existing behavior. Change it to **Yes** to allow clients to use other available maintenance windows to install software updates.

For more information, see the following articles:
- [How to configure client settings](../../clients/deploy/configure-client-settings.md)
- [How to use maintenance windows](../../clients/manage/collections/use-maintenance-windows.md)
