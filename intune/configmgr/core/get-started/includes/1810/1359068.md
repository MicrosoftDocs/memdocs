## <a name="bkmk_cmpivot"></a> Improvements to CMPivot
<!--1359068-->

CMPivot includes the following improvements:

- Save **Favorite** queries  

- On the Query Summary tab, select the count of Failed or Offline devices, and then select the option to **Create Collection**. This option makes it easy to target those devices with a remediation deployment.  

For more information on additional performance and troubleshooting improvements to CMPivot, see [Improvements to scripts](#bkmk_scripts).
