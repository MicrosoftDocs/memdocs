## <a name="bkmk_scripts"></a> Improvements to scripts
<!--1358239-->

The following performance and troubleshooting improvements apply to both CMPivot and Scripts:

- Updated clients return output less than 80 KB to the site over a fast communication channel. This change increases the performance of viewing script or query output.  

    - If the script or query output is greater than 80 KB, the client sends the data via a state message.  

    - If the client isn't updated to the latest version, it continues to use state messages.  

- Use the following logs to troubleshoot:  

    - On the client, by default in C:\Windows\CCM\logs:  
        - **Scripts.log**  
        - **CcmMessaging.log**  

    - On the MP, by default in C:\SMS_CCM\Logs: **MP_RelayMsgMgr.log**  

    - On the site server, by default in C:\Program Files\Configuration Manager\Logs: **SMS_Message_Processing_Engine.log**
