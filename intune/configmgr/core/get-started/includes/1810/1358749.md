## <a name="bkmk_bgoptions"></a> New boundary group options
<!--1358749-->

Boundary groups now include additional settings to give you more control over content distribution in your environment. This release adds the following options:

- **Prefer distribution points over peers with the same subnet**: By default, the management point prioritizes peer cache sources at the top of the list of content locations. This setting reverses that priority for clients that are in the same subnet as the peer cache source.  

- **Prefer cloud distribution points over distribution points**: If you have a branch office with a faster internet link, you can now prioritize cloud content.
