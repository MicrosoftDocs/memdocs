## <a name="bkmk_app-compliance"></a> Required app compliance policy for co-managed devices
<!--1358196-->

Define compliance policy rules in Configuration Manager for required applications. This app assessment is part of the overall compliance state sent to Microsoft Intune for co-managed devices.

### Try it out!

Try to complete the tasks. Then send [Feedback](../../../understand/product-feedback.md) with your thoughts on the feature.

1. In the Configuration Manager console, go to the **Assets and Compliance** workspace, expand **Compliance Settings**, and select the **Compliance Policies** node.  

2. Create a compliance policy. For more information, see [Create and deploy a device compliance policy](../../../../mdm/understand/what-happened-to-hybrid.md).  

3. On the **Rules** page, add a new rule for **All required apps installed with a deadline older than X days**. Specify a **Value** for the condition as the number of days.  

After you deploy the compliance policy, when a required app isn't installed after the specified number of days, the device is *not compliant*. Open Software Center and select the Device Compliance tab to see the compliance state.
