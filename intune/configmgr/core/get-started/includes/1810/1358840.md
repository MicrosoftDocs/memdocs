## <a name="bkmk_ccmsetup"></a> Improvement to client installation
<!--1358840-->

When installing the Configuration Manager client, the ccmsetup process contacts the management point to locate the necessary content. Previously in this process the management point only returns distribution points in the client's current boundary group. If no content is available, the setup process falls back to download content from the management point. There's no option to fall back to distribution points in other boundary groups that might have the necessary content. 

Now the management point returns distribution points based on boundary group configuration. If you define relationships on the boundary group, the management point returns distribution points in the following order:
1. Current boundary group  
2. Neighbor boundary groups  
3. The site default boundary group  

> [!Note]  
> The client setup process doesn't use the fallback time. To locate content as quickly as possible, it immediately falls back to the next boundary group.
