## <a name="bkmk_cmg"></a> Improvements to internet-based client setup
<!--1359181-->

This release further simplifies the Configuration Manager client setup process for clients on the internet. The site publishes additional Microsoft Entra information to the cloud management gateway (CMG). A Microsoft Entra joined client gets this information from the CMG during the ccmsetup process, using the same tenant to which it's joined. This behavior further simplifies enrolling devices to co-management in an environment with multiple Microsoft Entra tenants. 

Now the only two required ccmsetup properties are **CCMHOSTNAME** and **SMSSiteCode**. For example:

`ccmsetup.msi CCMSETUPCMD="CCMHOSTNAME=contoso.cloudapp.net/CCM_Proxy_MutualAuth/72186325152220500 SMSSiteCode=PS1"`

The AADRESOURCEURI and AADCLIENTAPPID properties aren't required.

For more information on these properties, see [Client installation properties](../../../clients/deploy/about-client-installation-properties.md).

This new behavior also simplifies client management when you change how your site is onboarded to Microsoft Entra ID. If you make changes to your Microsoft Entra connection, such as creating a new app, existing clients automatically download these changes. When they do a regular location refresh, they also download the latest Microsoft Entra information.
