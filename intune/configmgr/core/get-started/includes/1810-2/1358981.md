## <a name="bkmk_colleval"></a> Improvements to collection evaluation
<!--1358981-->

The following changes in collection evaluation behavior can improve site performance:  
 
- Previously, when you configured a schedule on a query-based collection, the site would continue to evaluate the query whether or not you enabled the collection setting to **Schedule a full update on this collection**. To fully disable the schedule, you had to change the schedule to **None**. 

    Now the site clears the schedule when you disable this setting. To specify a schedule for collection evaluation, enable the option to **Schedule a full update on this collection**.  

    When you update your site, for any existing collection on which you specified a schedule, the site enables the option to **Schedule a full update on this collection**. While this configuration may not be your intent, it was the actual behavior. To stop the site evaluating a collection on a schedule, disable this option.  

- You can't disable the evaluation of built-in collections like **All Systems**, but now you can configure the schedule. This behavior allows you to customize this action at a time that meets your business requirements. 

    > [!Tip]  
    > Only change the **Time** of the custom schedule on built-in collections. Don't change the **Recurrence pattern**. Future iterations may enforce a specific recurrence pattern.
