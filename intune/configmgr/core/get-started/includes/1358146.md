## <a name="bkmk_pod"></a> Phased deployment of software updates
<!--1358146-->

Create phased deployments for software updates. Phased deployments allow you to orchestrate a coordinated, sequenced rollout of software based on customizable criteria and groups.

In the Configuration Manager console, go to the **Software Library**, expand **Software Updates**, and select **All Software Updates**. Select one update, and then click **Create Phased Deployment** in the ribbon. This action is also available from the **All Windows 10 Updates** and **Office 365 Updates** nodes. 

The behavior of a software update phased deployment is the same as for task sequences and applications. For more information, see [Create phased deployments](../../../osd/deploy-use/create-phased-deployment-for-task-sequence.md).


### Known issues

- The Create Phased Deployment wizard only provides the option to **Automatically create a default two phase deployment**.

- The setting to **Gradually make the software available over this period of time (in days)** doesn't work.
