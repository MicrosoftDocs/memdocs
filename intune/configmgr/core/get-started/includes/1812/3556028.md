## <a name="bkmk_posh"></a> Improvements to Run PowerShell Script task sequence step
<!--3556028 fka 1359389-->
Based on customer feedback, the **Run PowerShell Script** task sequence step now includes the following improvements:  

- When you choose the **Enter a PowerShell script** option, select **Edit Script**. The new PowerShell script window provides the following actions:  

    - Edit the script directly  

    - Open an existing script from file  

    - Browse to an existing approved script in Configuration Manager

- Save the script output to a custom task sequence variable  

- To include the script parameters in the task sequence log, set the task sequence variable **OSDLogPowerShellParameters** to **TRUE**. By default, the parameters aren't in the log.
