## <a name="bkmk_uda"></a> Configure user device affinity in Software Center
<!--3485366-->
With [Software Center infrastructure improvements](../../../plan-design/changes/whats-new-in-version-1806.md#software-center-infrastructure-improvements) starting in version 1806, the application catalog site server roles are no longer required for most scenarios. Some customers still relied upon the application catalog to allow users to set their primary device for user device affinity. For more information, see [Link users and devices with user device affinity](../../../../apps/deploy-use/link-users-and-devices-with-user-device-affinity.md).

Now users can set their primary device in Software Center. This action makes them a primary user of the device in Configuration Manager.


### Prerequisite

Enable the following client setting in the **User and device affinity** group: **Allow user to define their primary devices**. For more information, see [About client settings](../../../clients/deploy/about-client-settings.md#user-and-device-affinity).


### Try it out!

Try to complete the tasks. Then send [Feedback](../../../understand/product-feedback.md) with your thoughts on the feature.

1. On a Configuration Manager client, open **Software Center**.  

2. Select the **Options** tab.  

3. In the **Work information** section, select the following option: **I regularly use this computer to do my work**.
