## <a name="bkmk_osdcmg"></a> Improvements to task sequences via CMG

This release includes the following improvements to deploy task sequences to devices that communicate via a cloud management gateway (CMG):

- Support for OS deployment<!-- 6997525 -->: With a task sequence that uses a boot image to deploy an OS, you can deploy it to a device that communicates via CMG. The user needs to start the task sequence from Software Center.

- This release fixes the two known issues from Configuration Manager current branch version 2002.<!-- 6983320 --> You can now run a task sequence on a device that communicates via CMG in the following circumstances:

  - A workgroup device that you register with a [bulk registration token](../../../../clients/deploy/deploy-clients-cmg-token.md)

  - You configure the site for [Enhanced HTTP](../../../../plan-design/hierarchy/enhanced-http.md) and the management point is HTTP

### Known issue with OS deployment via CMG

If there's an **Install Application** step in an OS deployment task sequence to a client via CMG, it fails to download the app policy.<!-- 7528983 --> To work around this issue, disable this step in the task sequence. Deploy the app separately from the task sequence.
