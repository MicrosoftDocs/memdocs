## <a name="bkmk_meter"></a> Improvements to client upgrade on a metered connection

<!--6976145-->

Starting in Configuration Manager technical preview version 2005, you could install and upgrade the client when you allowed client communication on a metered connection. You can now also configure the client setting **Client communication on metered internet connections** to **Limit**. This option reduces the client communication on a metered network, but now still allows the client to stay current.

For more information, see the following articles:

- [Technical preview 2005: Install and upgrade the client on a metered connection](../../technical-preview-2005.md#bkmk_meter)
- [About client settings: Client communication on metered internet connections](../../../../clients/deploy/about-client-settings.md#client-communication-on-metered-internet-connections)
