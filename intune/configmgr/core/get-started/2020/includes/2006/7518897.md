## <a name="bkmk_apps"></a> Tenant Attach: Improvements to Configuration Manager actions in Microsoft Intune admin center
<!--7518897-->

This release introduces  some improvements to the administration of Configuration Manager devices in Microsoft Intune admin center. Improvements include:

- Configuration errors now include links to documentation to help you troubleshoot.

- User available applications now appear in the **Applications** node for a ConfigMgr device.
   - The application list includes applications deployed to a user currently logged on to the device.
   - Multi-user session scenarios aren't supported.
   - Microsoft Entra joined devices aren't currently supported, only AD joined devices.

To deploy an application to a user, install the latest version of the Configuration Manager client, then follow the instructions in [Tenant attach: Install an application from the admin center](../../technical-preview-2005.md#bkmk_apps).
