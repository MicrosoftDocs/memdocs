## <a name="bkmk_deeplink"></a> Direct links to Configuration Manager Community hub items
<!--4224406-->
You can now easily navigate to and reference items in the Configuration Manager console Community hub node with a direct link. The intention for this feature is for easier collaboration and being able to share links to Community hub items with your colleagues. Currently, you'll see these links shared by the Configuration Manager team and in the documentation.
