## <a name="bkmk_wvd"></a> Improved support for Windows Virtual Desktop

<!--6527576-->

The **Windows 10 Enterprise multi-session** platform is available in the list of supported OS versions on objects with requirement rules or applicability lists.

For more information on Configuration Manager's support for Windows Virtual Desktop, see [Supported OS versions for clients and devices](../../../../plan-design/configs/supported-operating-systems-for-clients-and-devices.md#azure-virtual-desktop).

> [!NOTE]
> If you previously selected the top-level **Windows 10** platform, this action automatically selected all child platforms. This new platform isn't automatically selected. If you want to add **Windows 10 Enterprise multi-session**, manually select it in the list.

### Known issue with new OS platform

On a task sequence or package, when you select the **Windows 10 Enterprise multi-session** platform, after you save it reverts to **All Windows 10 x64**.

To work around this issue, run the following SQL script on the site database:

```sql
Update SupportedPlatforms
Set OSMaxVersion = '10.00.99999.9997'
Where DisplayText like '%multi%'
```
