## <a name="bkmk_availapp"></a> Improvements to available apps via CMG

<!--7033501-->

An internet-based, domain-joined device that isn't joined to Microsoft Entra ID and communicates via a cloud management gateway (CMG) can now get apps deployed as available. The Active Directory domain user of the device needs a matching Microsoft Entra identity. When the user starts Software Center, Windows prompts them to enter their Microsoft Entra credentials. They can then see any available apps.

Configure the following prerequisites to enable this functionality:

- Windows 10 device

  - Joined to your on-premises Active Directory domain

  - Communicate via CMG

- The site has discovered the user by both [Active Directory](../../../../servers/deploy/configure/about-discovery-methods.md#bkmk_aboutUser) and [Microsoft Entra user discovery](../../../../servers/deploy/configure/about-discovery-methods.md#azureaddisc)
