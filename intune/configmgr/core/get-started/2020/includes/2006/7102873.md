## <a name="bkmk_cmg-sup"></a> Intranet clients can use a CMG software update point

Intranet clients can now access a CMG software update point when it's assigned to the boundary group. Admins can allow intranet devices to scan against a CMG software update point in the following scenarios:

- When an internet machine connects to the VPN, it will continue scanning against the CMG software update point over the internet.
- If the only software update point for the boundary group is the CMG software update point, then all intranet and internet devices will scan against it.
