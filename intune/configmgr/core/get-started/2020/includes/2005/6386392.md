## <a name="bkmk_alertkey"></a> Notification for Microsoft Entra app secret key expiration

<!--6386392-->

Based on your feedback, if you [Configure Azure services](../../../../servers/deploy/configure/azure-services-wizard.md) to cloud-attach your site, the Configuration Manager console now displays notifications for the following circumstances:

- One or more Microsoft Entra app secret keys will expire soon
- One or more Microsoft Entra app secret keys have expired

To mitigate both cases, use the in-console action to [Renew secret the key](../../../../servers/deploy/configure/azure-services-wizard.md#bkmk_renew).

### <a name="ki_console"></a> Known issue: Console may unexpectedly close
<!--7329690-->
If you configure your site with a connection to the **Cloud Management** Azure service, this notification can cause the console to unexpectedly close. You use this Azure service for a variety of features, including the cloud management gateway (CMG) and Microsoft Entra discovery. For more information, see [Configure Azure services for use with Configuration Manager](../../../../servers/deploy/configure/azure-services-wizard.md#available-services).

By default, the site evaluates the state of this alert once per hour. To work around this issue, restart the console.
