## <a name="bkmk_availapp"></a> Microsoft Entra authentication in Software Center

<!-- 6935376 -->

This release fixes an issue with Software Center and Microsoft Entra authentication. For a client detected as on the intranet but communicating via the cloud management gateway (CMG), previously Software Center would use Windows authentication. When it tried to get the list of user available apps, it would fail. It now uses Microsoft Entra identity for devices joined to Microsoft Entra ID. These devices can be cloud-joined or hybrid-joined.
