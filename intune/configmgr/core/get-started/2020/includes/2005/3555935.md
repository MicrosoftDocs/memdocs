## Community hub and GitHub
<!--3555935, 3555936-->

The IT Admin community has developed a wealth of knowledge over the years. Rather than reinventing items like Scripts and Reports from scratch, we've built a **Configuration Manager Community hub** where IT Admins can share with each other. By leveraging the work of others, you can save hours of work. The Community hub fosters creativity by building on others' work and having other people build on yours. GitHub already has industry-wide processes and tools built for sharing. Now, the Community hub will leverage those tools directly in the Configuration Manager Console as foundational pieces for driving this new community. For the initial release, the content made available in the Community hub will be uploaded only by Microsoft. Currently, you can't upload your own content to GitHub for use by Community hub.

Community hub supports the following objects:
- PowerShell Scripts
- Reports
- Task sequences
- Applications
- Configuration items
