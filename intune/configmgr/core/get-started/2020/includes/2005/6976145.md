## <a name="bkmk_meter"></a> Install and upgrade the client on a metered connection

<!--6976145-->

Previously, if the device was connected to a metered network, new clients wouldn't install. Existing clients only upgraded if you allowed all client communication. For devices that are frequently roaming on a metered network, they would be unmanaged or on an older client version. Starting in this release, client install and upgrade both work when you set the client setting **Client communication on metered internet connections** to **Allow**.

To define the behavior for a new client installation, there's a new ccmsetup parameter **/AllowMetered**. When you allow client communication on a metered network for ccmsetup, it downloads the content, registers with the site, and downloads the initial policy. Any further client communication follows the configuration of the client setting from that policy.

If you reinstall the client on an existing device, it uses the following priority to determine its configuration:

1. Existing local client policy
1. The last command line stored in the Windows registry
1. Parameters on the ccmsetup command line

For more information, see the following articles:

- [About client installation parameters and properties](../../../../clients/deploy/about-client-installation-properties.md)

### Known issue with install and upgrade on metered connections
<!-- 7330894 -->
If you configure the client setting to **Limit**, the client won't install or upgrade. To work around this issue, configure the client setting to **Allow**.
