## Report setup and upgrade failures to Microsoft
<!--5622909-->
 If the setup or update process fails to complete successfully, you can now report the error directly to Microsoft. If a failure occurs, the **Report update error to Microsoft** button is enabled. When you use the button, an interactive wizard opens allowing you to provide more information to us. In technical previews, this button is always enabled even when the setup completes successfully.
 
 When running setup from the media rather than the console, you'll also be given the **Report update error to Microsoft** option if setup fails.
