## <a name="bkmk_server"></a> Improved Windows Server restart experience for non-administrator accounts

<!--7821529-->

For a low-rights user on a device that runs Windows Server, by default they aren't assigned the user rights to restart Windows. When you target a deployment to this device, this user can't manually restart. For example, they can't restart Windows to install software updates.

Starting in this release, you can now control this behavior as needed. In the **Computer Restart** group of client settings, enable the following setting: **When a deployment requires a restart, allow low-rights users to restart a device running Windows Server**.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Allowing low-rights users to restart a server can potentially impact other users or services.

For more information on client settings, see [How to configure client settings](../../../../clients/deploy/configure-client-settings.md).
