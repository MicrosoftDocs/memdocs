## <a name="bkmk_coll"></a> View collection relationships

<!--3608121-->

Based on your feedback, you can now view dependency relationships between collections in a graphical format. It shows limiting, include, and exclude relationships.

If you want to change or delete collections, view the relationships to understand the impact of the proposed change. Before you create a deployment, look at the potential target collection for any include or exclude relationships that might affect the deployment.

### Try it out!

Try to complete the tasks. Then send [Feedback](../../technical-preview-2003.md#bkmk_feedback) with your thoughts on the feature.

1. In the Configuration Manager console, go to the **Assets and Compliance** workspace, and select the **Device Collections** node.

1. Select a collection, and then in the ribbon, select **View Relationships**. On the main page:

    - To view the relationships with parent collections, select **Dependency**.

    - To view the relationships with child collections, select **Dependent**.

    For example, if you select the **All Systems** collection to view its relationships, the **Dependency** node will be **0** as it has no parent collections.

Use the following tips to navigate the relationship viewer:

- Select the plus (`+`) or minus (`-`) icons next to the collection name to expand or collapse members of a node.

- The number in parentheses after the collection name is the number of relationships. If the number is **0**, then that collection is the final or leaf node in that relationship tree.

- The style and color of the line between the collections determines the type of relationship:

    If you hover over a specific line, a tooltip shows the relationship type.

- When the width of the tree is larger than the window, use the green arrows to the right or the left to view more.

- When a node of the relationship tree is larger than the available space, select **More** to change the view to just that node.

- To navigate to a prior view, select the **Back** arrow in the upper right corner. Select the **Home** icon to return to the main page.

- Use the **Search** box in the upper right corner to locate a collection in the current tree view.

- Use the **Navigator** in the lower right corner to zoom and pan around the tree. You can also print the current view.
