## <a name="bkmk_notifications"></a> Improvements to in-console notifications
<!--7410221-->
You now have an updated look and feel for in-console notifications. Notifications are more readable and the action link is easier to find. Additionally, the age of the notification is displayed to help you find the latest information. If you dismiss or snooze a notification, that action is now persistent for your user across consoles.

 Right-click or select `...` on the notification to take one of the following actions:
- **Translate text**: Launches [Bing Translator](https://www.bing.com/translator/) for the text.
- **Copy text**: Copies the notification text to the clipboard.
- **Snooze**: Snoozes the notification for the specified duration:
   - One hour
   - One day
   - One week
   - One month
- **Dismiss**: Dismisses the notification.

To see these improvements for notifications, update the Configuration Manager console to the latest version.
