## <a name="bkmk_patch"></a> Notifications for devices no longer receiving updates
<!--7520646-->
To help you manage security risk in your environment, you'll be notified in-console about devices with operating systems that are past the end of support date and that are no longer eligible to receive security updates. Additionally, a new **Management Insights** rule was added to detect Windows 7, Windows Server 2008, and Windows Server 2008 R2 without [Extended Security Updates (ESU)](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4497181/lifecycle-faq-extended-security-updates).

Environments with the following operating systems installed on client devices receive a notification:

- [Windows 7](/lifecycle/products/windows-7), [Windows Server 2008 (non-Azure)](/lifecycle/products/windows-server-2008), and [Windows Server 2008 R2 (non-Azure)](/lifecycle/products/windows-server-2008-r2) without ESU.
- Versions of Windows 10 Semi-Annual Channel that are past the end-of-support date.
   - [Enterprise and Education](/lifecycle/products/windows-10-enterprise-and-education)
   - [Home and Pro](/lifecycle/products/windows-10-home-and-pro)

Selecting **More info** on either of these notifications takes you to **All Insights** in **Management Insights**. Choose from the following options for review:

- For Windows 10 clients, review the **Update clients to a supported Windows 10 version** rule in the **Simplified Management** group. The rule shows clients running Windows 10 versions that are no longer supported or will reach end of service within the next three months.

- For Windows 7, Windows Server 2008, and Windows Server 2008 R2 without [Extended Security Updates (ESU)](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4497181/lifecycle-faq-extended-security-updates), review the new rule, **Update clients running Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008** in the **Security** group. The rule shows clients running Windows 7, Windows Server 2008, and Windows Server 2008 R2 that are no longer receiving security updates.
