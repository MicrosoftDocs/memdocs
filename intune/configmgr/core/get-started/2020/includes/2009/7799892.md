## <a name="bkmk_osd"></a> Improvements to OS deployment 

This release includes the following improvements to OS deployment:

- After you update the site to version 2009, the Configuration Manager console shows the size in KB for all existing task sequences.<!--7799892--> Previously, the console showed a size of **0** for existing task sequences, which only updated when you modified the task sequence.

- It resolves a bug with boot image metadata on PXE-enabled distribution points that have multiple content library drives.<!--7068388--> This bug could cause the client to fail to download the boot image over TFTP.
