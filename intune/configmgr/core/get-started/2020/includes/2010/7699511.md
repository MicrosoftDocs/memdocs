## <a name="bkmk_health"></a> Improvements to scenario health

<!--7699511-->

Technical preview version 2008 added the ability to [monitor scenario health](../../technical-preview-2008.md#bkmk_health), which initially focused on SQL Server Service Broker. In this release, you can now monitor the health of the fast channel used for client actions. If your environment is [tenant attached with devices uploaded](../../../../../tenant-attach/device-sync-actions.md), this feature helps you see potential issues with client actions from the Microsoft Intune admin center. You can also use this feature for on-premises client actions. For example, CMPivot, run scripts, and device wake-up.

### Try it out!

Try to complete the tasks. Then send [Feedback](../../technical-preview-2003.md#bkmk_feedback) with your thoughts on the feature.

1. In the Configuration Manager console, go to the **Monitoring** workspace, and select the **Scenario Health** node. The list view displays the available scenarios.

1. Select the **Client action health** scenario, then in the ribbon, select **Show Status**. This action opens a window with more information. The top section shows the overall status per site. Select a site, to see more detailed status for that site in the bottom section.
