## <a name="bkmk_sum"></a> Enable user proxy for software update scans
<!--8379199-->
Beginning with the September 2020 cumulative update, HTTP-based WSUS servers will be secure by default. A client scanning for updates against an HTTP-based WSUS will no longer be allowed to leverage a user proxy by default. If you still require a user proxy despite the security trade-offs, a new [software updates client setting](../../../../clients/deploy/about-client-settings.md#software-updates) is available to allow these connections. For more information, see [September 2020 changes to improve security for Windows devices scanning WSUS](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2144403).

To enable a user proxy for software update scans:

1. In the Configuration Manager console, choose **Administration** > **Client Settings**.
1. Select either the **Default Client Settings** or the set of custom client device settings to edit.
1. On the **Home** tab, choose **Properties**.
1. Select the **Software Updates** group of settings.
1. Set **Allow user proxy for software update scans** to **Yes**.

When the client policy refreshes, devices will get the new value and apply it during the next scan cycle.
