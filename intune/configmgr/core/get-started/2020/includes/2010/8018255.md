## <a name="bkmk_tsdt"></a> Deploy a task sequence to a user

<!--8018255-->

Based on your feedback, you can now deploy a non-OS deployment task sequence to a user-based collection. Use the task sequence deployment type of an application to install or uninstall it.

For more information, including the list of prerequisites, see [Task sequence deployment type](../../../../../apps/get-started/creating-windows-applications.md#bkmk_tsdt).

> [!NOTE]
> To take full advantage of new Configuration Manager features, after you update the site, also update clients to the latest version. While new functionality appears in the Configuration Manager console when you update the site and console, the complete scenario isn't functional until the client version is also the latest.
