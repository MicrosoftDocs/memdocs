## <a name="bkmk_pwsh7"></a> Support for PowerShell version 7

<!--6023299-->

The Configuration Manager [PowerShell cmdlet library](/powershell/sccm/overview) now offers preliminary support for PowerShell 7. PowerShell 7 support is in preview, and isn't intended for use in production environments. If you have any problems using Configuration Manager cmdlets with PowerShell 7, [send feedback](../../technical-preview-2003.md#bkmk_feedback) from the Configuration Manager console to report it.

For more information on PowerShell 7, including directions on how to download and install it, see [Install PowerShell on Windows](/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-core-on-windows).

> [!TIP]
> PowerShell 7 runs as `pwsh.exe`. Earlier versions of PowerShell run as `powershell.exe`.

### Known issues

- You currently can't launch PowerShell 7 directly from the Configuration Manager console. Manually start PowerShell 7, and then [import the Configuration Manager module](/powershell/sccm/overview#import-the-configuration-manager-powershell-module).

- Configuration Manager cmdlets with **Import-** and **Export-** verbs may not function as expected.

- This release only supports the Configuration Manager cmdlets. Other features of Configuration Manager that rely on PowerShell may not support version 7. For example, [Run Scripts](../../../../../apps/deploy-use/create-deploy-scripts.md), [CMPivot](../../../../servers/manage/cmpivot.md), or the [Run PowerShell Script](../../../../../osd/understand/task-sequence-steps.md#BKMK_RunPowerShellScript) task sequence step.
