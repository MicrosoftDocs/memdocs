## Improvements to CMPivot

<!--6518631-->

We've added the ability to run CMPivot from an individual device or multiple devices from the devices node without needing to select a device collection. This improvement makes it easier for people, such as those working as the Helpdesk persona, to create CMPivot queries for specific devices outside a pre-created collection.

Additionally, upon returning devices within a query list view, you can select **Device Pivot** on one or more devices and then pivot and query on just those devices to drill in further. This change allows you to drill in without querying the larger set of devices from the original collection.

We've also converged CMPivot standalone and CMPivot launched from the admin console. When you launch CMPivot from the admin console, it uses the same underlying technology as CMPivot standalone to give you scenario parity.
