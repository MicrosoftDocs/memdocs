## <a name="bkmk_mem"></a> Tenant attach: ConfigMgr client details in the admin center
<!--6374854, 6521921-->

You can now see client details including collections, boundary group membership, and real-time client information for a specific device in the Microsoft Intune admin center.

> [!Important]
> - This is a preview experience. The final location will be the devices blade in Microsoft Intune admin center.
> - The boundary groups tab functions only for stand alone sites. The tab will be empty in the admin center for anything other than a standalone primary site.

### Try it out!

Try to complete the tasks. Then send [Feedback](../../technical-preview-2003.md#bkmk_feedback) with your thoughts on the feature.

#### Prerequisites

- An environment that's [tenant attached with uploaded devices](../../../../../tenant-attach/device-sync-actions.md).
- One of the following browsers:
  - Microsoft Edge, version 77 and later
  - Google Chrome
- The user account has been discovered with both [Microsoft Entra user discovery](../../../../servers/deploy/configure/about-discovery-methods.md#azureaddisc) and [Active Directory user discovery](../../../../servers/deploy/configure/about-discovery-methods.md#bkmk_aboutUser).
  - Meaning the user account needs to be a synced user object in Azure.

#### Permissions

The user account needs the following permissions:

- The **Read** permission for the device's **Collection** in Configuration Manager.
- The **Admin User** role for the Configuration Manager Microservice application in Microsoft Entra ID.
  - Add the role in Microsoft Entra ID from **Enterprise applications** > **Configuration Manager Microservice** > **Users and groups** > **Add user**. Groups are supported if you have Microsoft Entra ID P1 or P2.

#### View ConfigMgr client details

1. In the Configuration Manager console, go to the **Assets and Compliance** workspace and select the **Devices** node.
1. Right-click on a device that's been uploaded to Microsoft Intune.
1. In the right-click menu, select **Start** > **Admin Center Preview** to open the preview in your browser.
     - This launch is a preview experience. The final location will be in Microsoft Intune admin center.

> [!NOTE]
> Note the following behaviors for some of the client details:
>
> - The primary site updates the following fields once an hour: **Last policy request**, **Last active time**, and **Last management point**
>
> - To populate the **Logged on user** field, at least one user needs to sign in to the device after you install the Configuration Manager client

### Troubleshoot client details

One of the most common issues is with the administrative user account:

1. Make sure that Configuration Manager has discovered the administrative user account you're using. In the Configuration Manager console, go to the **Assets and Compliance** workspace. Select the **Users** node, and find your user account.

    If your account isn't listed in the **Users** node, check the configuration of the site's [Active Directory User discovery](../../../../servers/deploy/configure/about-discovery-methods.md#bkmk_aboutUser).

1. Verify the discovery data. Select your user account. In the ribbon, on the **Home** tab select **Properties**. In the properties window, confirm the following discovery data:

    - **Microsoft Entra tenant ID**: This value should be a GUID for the Microsoft Entra tenant.
    - **Microsoft Entra user ID**: This value should be a GUID for this account in Microsoft Entra ID.
    - **User Principal Name**: The format of this value is user@domain. For example, `jqpublic@contoso.com`.

    If the Microsoft Entra properties are empty, check the configuration of the site's [Microsoft Entra user discovery](../../../../servers/deploy/configure/about-discovery-methods.md#azureaddisc).

1. Use the same account to sign in to the admin center preview portal. The on-premises identity has to be synchronized with and match the cloud identity.
