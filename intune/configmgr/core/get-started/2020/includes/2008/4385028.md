## <a name="bkmk_setupdiag"></a> Analyze SetupDiag errors for feature updates

<!--4385028-->

With the release of Windows 10, version 2004, the [SetupDiag](/windows/deployment/upgrade/setupdiag) diagnostic tool is included with Windows Setup. If there's an issue with the upgrade, SetupDiag automatically runs to determine the cause of the failure.

Configuration Manager now gathers and summarizes SetupDiag results from feature update deployments with [Windows 10 servicing](../../../../../osd/deploy-use/manage-windows-as-a-service.md).

The **Windows 10 Servicing** dashboard in the **Software Library** workspace of the Configuration Manager console now includes a tile for **Collection Errors**:

You can scope the tile to a specific collection. Each bar shows the number of devices that failed with the specified error code. For more information, see [Windows upgrade error codes](/windows/deployment/upgrade/upgrade-error-codes).

### Prerequisites to analyze SetupDiag errors

- Windows 10 servicing with Configuration Manager

- Windows 10, version 2004, or later
