## <a name="bkmk_folder"></a> Import objects to current folder

<!--6601203-->

Based on your feedback, now when you import an object in the Configuration Manager console, it imports to the current folder. Previously, Configuration Manager always put imported objects in the root node. This new behavior applies to applications, packages, driver packages, and task sequences.

For example:

1. In the Configuration Manager console, go to the **Software Library** workspace, expand **Application Management**, and select the **Packages** node.
1. In the ribbon, on the **Folder** tab, select **Create Folder**. Name it **Test**. If it's not already selected, select the new folder.
1. In the ribbon, on the **Home** tab, select **Import**. Import a package object.

The Configuration Manager console imports the package into the **Test** folder, instead of the root **Packages** node.
