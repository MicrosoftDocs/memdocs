## <a name="bkmk_support"></a> Improvements to Support Center

<!--8272488-->

When you troubleshoot software update deployments, you might ask the following questions:

- Are any updates missing or failing?
- Are specific updates deployed to a device?
- What are the error codes for a deployment?
- Why didn't the device reboot during a maintenance window?
- What's the current state of an update?

Support Center already shows updates that are targeted to the device but not yet installed. Now in this release, select **All Updates** on the **Content** tab of Support Center to show all updates targeted to the device. To help you troubleshoot, this list includes information about whether the update is installed or missing.

Also on the **Content** tab, select **Maintenance Windows** to show the available maintenance windows for the device.

For more information on the additional features of Support Center that you can use to help troubleshoot a device, see [Support Center overview](../../../../support/support-center.md).
