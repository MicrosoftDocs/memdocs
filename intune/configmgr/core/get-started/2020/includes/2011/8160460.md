## <a name="bkmk_lifedash"></a> Improvements to the product lifecycle dashboard

<!--8160460-->

This release includes improvements to the [product lifecycle dashboard](../../../../clients/manage/asset-intelligence/product-lifecycle-dashboard.md) to make it more actionable for you.

- Customize the timeframe on the charts for your preference.
- Search, sort, and filter the data.
- View a list of devices with products that are near or at end of support, and you need to update.

The dashboard also has a new subnode, **All Product Lifecycle Data**. You can sort and filter the product lifecycle information, which gives you multiple ways to view it. When you select a product, you can **View devices** for that product. From the list of devices, you can currently create a direct membership collection. Use this action to deploy the latest software versions to these collections so that the devices are kept current.

The dashboard has a new time slider. Use it to control the timeframe for the **Top 5 products nearing end-of-support** tile. The default is 18 months, but you can adjust it from 1 to 36 months.
