## <a name="bkmk_hub"></a> Categorize Community hub content

<!--8052494-->
Community hub content is grouped into a Microsoft, curated, or unreviewed category to allow admins to choose the types of content their environment displays. Admins can choose from the different categories of content that are provided in the [Community hub](../../../../servers/manage/community-hub.md) to match their risk profile and their willingness to share and use content from those outside Microsoft and outside their own company.

Community hub content has three categories for content sources:
- **Microsoft curated**: Content provided by Microsoft
- **Community curated**: Content provided by the community that gets reviewed by Microsoft
- **Community unreviewed**: General content from the community that doesn't get reviewed by Microsoft

Admins can choose the types of content their environment displays from the following options:

- **Display Microsoft content**: Selecting this option means that only content created by Microsoft will be shown in the Community hub. This content has had some basic testing and scanning validation to confirm no malware and inappropriate text.
- **Display Microsoft and curated community content**: Show curated content from both Microsoft and community partners with basic level of review. Selecting this option means that only content that has been curated will be shown. The curation process includes basic review to confirm that the content doesn’t have malware and inappropriate text, but hasn’t necessarily been tested. It will include content from the community, not just from Microsoft.
- **Display all content including unreviewed content**:  Selecting this option means that all content is shown. This option includes unreviewed open-source type samples from the community, meaning that the content hasn’t necessarily been reviewed at all. It's provided as-is as open-source type sample content. Doing your own inspection and testing before using is highly encouraged, which is good practice on any content, but especially this class of content.

Since the content is *open-source* style content, admins should always review what is provided before consuming it. The new curation process is intended to vet the material to make sure there aren't obvious quality or compliance issues, but it will be somewhat of a cursory review. All content stored within GitHub and accessed from the Community hub isn’t supported by Microsoft. Microsoft doesn’t validate content collected from or shared by the general community. For more information, see [GitHub Terms of Service](https://help.github.com/terms) and [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://help.github.com/privacy).

#### Permissions

Full Administrators can opt in the hierarchy for unreviewed content via hierarchy settings. Lower hierarchy administrators can't opt in the hierarchy for unreviewed hub items.

Most [built-in security roles](../../../../understand/fundamentals-of-role-based-administration.md) will have access to Community hub: 

|Role name|View the hub| Contribute hub content|Download hub content|
|---|---|---|---|
|Remote Tools Operator|No|N/A|N/A|
|Read Only Analyst|Yes|No|No|
|All other roles|Yes|Yes|Yes|
