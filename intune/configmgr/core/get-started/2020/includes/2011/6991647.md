## <a name="bkmk_ogs"></a> Approved scripts for Orchestration Groups
<!--6991647-->
You can now select from scripts that were approved when configuring pre and post-scripts for an [orchestration group](../../../../../sum/deploy-use/orchestration-groups.md). When in the **Create Orchestration Group Wizard**, you'll see a new page called **Script Picker**. Select your pre and post scripts from your list of scripts that are already approved. You can still add scripts manually on the pre and post-script pages. Additionally, you can also edit scripts that you prepopulated from the **Script Picker**.
