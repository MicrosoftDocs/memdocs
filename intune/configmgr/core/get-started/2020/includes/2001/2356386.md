## <a name="bkmk_tsprogress"></a> Improvements to task sequence progress

<!--5932692, fka 2356386-->

Based on your feedback, the task sequence progress window includes the following improvements:

- Shows the current step number, total number of steps, and percent completion
- Increased the width of the window to give you more space to better show the organization name in a single line

![Example task sequence progress](../../media/2356386-task-sequence-progress.png)

> [!NOTE]
> The count and percentage completed are intended for general guidance purposes only. These values are based on the total number of steps in the task sequence. For a more complex task sequence with disabled steps or groups, or steps that run conditionally based on task sequence logic, the progress may be non-linear.
>
> For example, if your task sequence has 10 steps and you disable steps #3 through #7, the task sequence progress initially shows `1 of 10 (10%)` and then `2 of 10 (20%)`, and then it jumps to `8 of 10 (80%)`.
