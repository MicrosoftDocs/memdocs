## <a name="bkmk_edge-dash"></a> Microsoft Edge Management dashboard

<!--3871913-->
The Microsoft Edge Management dashboard provides you insights on the usage of Microsoft Edge and other browsers. In this dashboard, you can:

- See how many of your devices have Microsoft Edge installed
- See how many clients have different versions of Microsoft Edge installed
- Have a view of the installed browsers across devices

### Prerequisites

Enable the following properties in the below [hardware inventory](../../../../clients/manage/inventory/extend-hardware-inventory.md) classes:

- **Installed Software - Asset Intelligence (SMS_InstalledSoftware)**
   - Software Code
   - Product Name
   - Product Version

- **Default Browser (SMS_DefaultBrowser)**
   - Browser Program ID

From the **Software Library** workspace, click **Microsoft Edge Management** to see the dashboard. Change the collection for the graph data by clicking **Browse** and choosing another collection. By default your five largest collections are in the drop-down list. When you select a collection that isn't in the list, the newly selected collection takes the bottom spot on your drop-down list.
