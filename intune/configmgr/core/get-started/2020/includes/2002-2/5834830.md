<!--5834830-->

When new cloud-based features are available in the Microsoft Intune admin center, or other attached cloud services for your on-premises Configuration Manager installation, you can now opt in to these new features in the Configuration Manager console. For more information on enabling features in the Configuration Manager console, see [Enable optional features from updates](../../../../servers/manage/optional-features.md).
