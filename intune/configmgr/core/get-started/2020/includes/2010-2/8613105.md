## <a name="bkmk_rest"></a> Improvements to the administration service

<!--8613105-->

The Configuration Manager REST API, the administration service, requires a secure HTTPS connection. With the previous methods to enable HTTPS, enabling IIS on the SMS Provider was a prerequisite.

Starting in this release, you no longer need to enable IIS on the SMS Provider for the administration service. When you enable the site for enhanced HTTP, it creates a self-signed certificate for the SMS Provider, and automatically binds it without requiring IIS.

If you previously had IIS installed on the SMS Provider, you can remove it. Then restart the SMS_REST_PROVIDER component.

> [!NOTE]
> If you don't use enhanced HTTP, you need to manually bind a server authentication certificate to port 443 on the SMS Provider. One method is to use IIS.
>
> You can also use the netsh command line tool, which doesn't require IIS. You can use a command line similar to the following example:
>
> `netsh http add sslcert ippport=<ipaddress>:443 certhash=<certhash>`
>
> You may require additional command line options depending upon your environment and requirements. For more information, see [Netsh http commands](/windows-server/networking/technologies/netsh/netsh-http).
