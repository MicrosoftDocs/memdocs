## <a name="bkmk_uda"></a> Tenant attach: Troubleshooting portal lists a userâ€™s devices based on usage
<!--6974300-->
The troubleshooting portal in the [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431) allows you to search for a user and view their associated devices. Starting in this release, tenant attached devices that are assigned [user device affinity automatically based on usage](../../../../../apps/deploy-use/link-users-and-devices-with-user-device-affinity.md#set-up-the-site-to-automatically-create-user-device-affinities) will now be returned when searching for a user.

### Prerequisites

- An environment that's [tenant attached with uploaded devices](../../../../../tenant-attach/device-sync-actions.md)
- Install the latest version of the Configuration Manager client.
- Target clients with **User and Device Affinity** [client settings](../../../../clients/deploy/about-client-settings.md#user-and-device-affinity) to automatically create the affinities.

### Try it out!

Try to complete the tasks. Then send [Feedback](../../technical-preview-2003.md#bkmk_feedback) with your thoughts on the feature.

#### View a user's devices

1. Go to the [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431).
1. Select **Troubleshooting + support**.
1. On the **Troubleshoot** page, select **Change user** then search for a user.
1. The **Devices** chart lists the ConfigMgr devices associated with the user.  
   - Devices that previously reported affinity will resend their affinity to reflect in the admin center.
   - Devices that aren't already associated with a user will be updated once the affinity threshold has been met and reported.
