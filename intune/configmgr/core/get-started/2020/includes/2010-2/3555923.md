## <a name="bkmk_osdcmg"></a> Improvements to deploy an OS over CMG using boot media

<!--3555923-->

Technical preview branch version 2009 included support for using boot media to reimage internet-based devices that connect through a cloud management gateway (CMG).

This release streamlines the administrative workflow in the Configuration Manager console. On the **Media Management** page of the **Create Task Sequence Media Wizard**, the **Internet-based media** option no longer exists. Select the **Site-based media** option. Then still select the CMG for the management point on the **Boot Image** page.

For more information, see [Deploy an OS over CMG using boot media](../../technical-preview-2009.md#bkmk_osdcmg).
