## <a name="bkmk_da"></a> Desktop Analytics support for new Windows 10 data levels

<!--6979470-->

Microsoft is increasing transparency by categorizing the data that Windows 10 collects:

- **Basic** diagnostic data is recategorized as **Required** diagnostic data
- **Full** is recategorized as **Optional**
- **Enhanced (Limited)** is recategorized as **Optional (Limited)**

> [!TIP]
> Starting in Configuration Manager current branch version 2006, the **Diagnostic Data** tab of the Desktop Analytics service in the Configuration Manager console already uses these new labels.

If you previously configured devices for **Enhanced** or **Enhanced (Limited)**, in an upcoming release of Windows 10, they'll use the **Required** level. This change may impact the functionality of Desktop Analytics.

> [!NOTE]
> You can test the behavioral changes now in Windows 10 Insider Preview build 19577 and later.

Configuration Manager will properly configure the devices. If you're using another mechanism to configure these policies on devices, you may need to make changes for the upcoming new behavior. For more information, see [Changes to Windows diagnostic data collection](/windows/privacy/changes-to-windows-diagnostic-data-collection#behaviorial-changes).

After you enroll Windows Insider devices to Desktop Analytics, it may take up to 48 hours to appear on the Desktop Analytics portal or the new configurations to take effect. Use the Configuration Manager console to look for issues or configuration alerts as you [Monitor connection health](../../../../../desktop-analytics/monitor-connection-health.md).
