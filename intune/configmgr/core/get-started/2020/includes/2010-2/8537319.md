## <a name="bkmk_aadauth"></a> Disable Microsoft Entra authentication for onboarded tenants

<!--8537319-->

You can now disable Microsoft Entra authentication for tenants not associated with users and devices. When you onboard Configuration Manager to Microsoft Entra ID, it allows the site and clients to use modern authentication. Currently, Microsoft Entra device authentication is enabled for all onboarded tenants, whether or not it has devices. For example, you have a separate tenant with a subscription that you use for compute resources to support a cloud management gateway. If there aren't users or devices associated with the tenant, disable Microsoft Entra authentication.

### Try it out!
