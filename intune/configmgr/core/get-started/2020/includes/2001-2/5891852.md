## <a name="bkmk_sendsmile"></a> Send a smile improvements
<!--5891852-->

When you **Send a smile** or **Send a frown**, a status message is created when the feedback is submitted. This improvement provides a record of:
- When the feedback was submitted
- Who submitted the feedback
- The feedback ID
- If the feedback submission was successful or not

A status message with an ID of 53900 is a successful submission and 53901 is a failed submission.
