## <a name="bkmk_tsprogress"></a> Additional improvement to task sequence progress

<!--5932692, fka 2356386-->

Based on your feedback from the [improvements in technical preview version 2001](../../technical-preview-2001.md#bkmk_tsprogress), this release includes the following change:

- By default, the task sequence progress window uses the existing text. If you make no changes, it continues to work the same as in version 1912 and earlier.

- To show the new progress information, specify the new task sequence variable, **TSProgressInfoLevel**. You can set the type of information it displays by using the following values for this variable:

  - `1`: Include the current step and total steps to the progress text. For example, **2 of 10**.
  - `2`: Include the current step, total steps, and percentage completed. This behavior is the same as version 2001. For example, **2 of 10 (20% complete)**.
  - `3`: Include the percentage completed. For example, **(20% complete)**.
