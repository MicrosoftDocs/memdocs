## <a name="bkmk_subnet"></a> Exclude certain subnets for peer content download

<!--3555777-->

Boundary groups include the following option for peer downloads: **During peer downloads, only use peers within the same subnet**. If you enable this option, the management point only includes in the content location list peer sources that are in the same subnet and boundary group as the client. For more information on this option, see [Boundary group options for peer downloads](../../../../servers/deploy/configure/boundary-group-options.md).

Depending on the configuration of your network, you can now exclude certain subnets for matching. For example, you want to include a boundary but exclude a specific VPN subnet. By default, Configuration Manager excludes the default Teredo subnet (`2001:0000:%`).

Import your subnet exclusion list as a comma-separated subnet string. Use the percent sign (`%`) as a wildcard character. On the top-level site server, set or read the **SubnetExclusionList** embedded property for the **SMS_HIERARCHY_MANAGER** component in the **SMS_SCI_Component** class. For more information, see [SMS_SCI_Component server WMI class](../../../../../develop/reference/core/servers/configure/sms_sci_component-server-wmi-class.md). The following script is a sample way of changing this value.

```PowerShell
#
# This sample sets the SubnetExclusionList property's for SMS_HIERARCHY_MANAGER component for the top-level site
#

# Replace "2001:0000:%,172.16.16.0" with the subnets that you would like to exclude. It's a comma separated string.
# This script must be run on the top-level site server
$PropertyValue = "2001:0000:%,172.16.16.0"


# Don't change any of the lines below
$PropertyName = "SubnetExclusionList"

# Get provider instance
$providerMachine = Get-WmiObject -namespace "root\sms" -class "SMS_ProviderLocation"

if($providerMachine -is [system.array])
{
    $providerMachine=$providerMachine[0]
}

$SiteCode = $providerMachine.SiteCode

$component = gwmi -ComputerName $providerMachine.Machine -namespace root\sms\site_$SiteCode -query 'select comp.* from sms_sci_component comp join SMS_SCI_SiteDefinition sdef on sdef.SiteCode=comp.SiteCode where sdef.ParentSiteCode="" and comp.componentname="SMS_HIERARCHY_MANAGER"'
$properties = $component.props

Write-host "Updating property for site " $SiteCode

foreach ($property in $properties)
{
  if ($property.propertyname -like $PropertyName) 
  {
    Write-host "Current value for SubnetExclusionList is  " $property.value1
    $property.value1 = $PropertyValue
    Write-host "Updating value for SubnetExclusionList to " $property.value1
    break
  }
}

$component.props = $properties
$component.put()
```

> [!NOTE]
> By default, Configuration Manager includes the Teredo subnet in this list. When you change the list, always read the existing value first. Append additional subnets to the list, and then set the new value.
