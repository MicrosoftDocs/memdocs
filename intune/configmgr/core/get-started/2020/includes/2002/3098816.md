## <a name="bkmk_orch"></a> Improvements to Orchestration Groups
<!--3098816-->
Create orchestration groups to better control the deployment of software updates to devices. An orchestration group gives you the flexibility to update devices based on a percentage, a specific number, or an explicit order. You can also run a PowerShell script before and after the devices run the update deployment.

Orchestration Groups are the evolution of the "Server Groups" feature. They were first introduced in the [technical preview for Configuration Manager, version 1909](../../../2019/technical-preview-1909.md). We improved upon Orchestration groups in [technical preview 2001](../../technical-preview-2001.md#bkmk_orch) and [technical preview 2001.2](../../technical-preview-2001-2.md#bkmk_orch). In this technical preview, we've added the following improvements to Orchestration Groups:

- Clear the state, such as **Complete* or *Failed*, for an Orchestration Group member so you can rerun the orchestration.
   - Right-click on the Orchestration Group member and select **Reset Orchestration Group Member**.
- Start some basic operations like **Resource Explorer** and **Enable Verbose Logging** for selected members.
- Updates requiring restarts now work with orchestration.

### Try it out!

Try to complete the tasks. Then send [Feedback](../../../../understand/product-feedback.md) with your thoughts on the feature.

#### Prerequisites

- To see all of the orchestration groups and updates for those groups, your account needs to be a **Full Administrator**.
- Enable the **Orchestration Groups** feature. For more information, see [Enable optional features](../../../../servers/manage/optional-features.md).

    > [!NOTE]
    > When you enable **Orchestration Groups**, the site disables the **Server Groups** feature. This behavior avoids any conflicts between the two features.

#### Create an orchestration group

1. In the Configuration Manager console, go to the **Assets and Compliance** workspace, and select the **Orchestration Group** node.

1. In the ribbon, select **Create Orchestration Group** to open the **Create Orchestration Group Wizard**.

1. On the **General** page, give your orchestration group a **Name** and optionally a **Description**. Specify your values for the following items:
   - **The Orchestration Group timeout (in minutes)**: Time limit for all group members to complete update installation.
   - **Orchestration Group member timeout (in minutes)**: Time limit for a single device in the group to complete the update installation.


1. On the **Member Selection** page, first specify the **Site code**. Then select **Add** to add device resources as members of this orchestration group. **Search** for devices by name, and then **Add** them. You can also filter your search to a single collection by using **Search in Collection**.  Select **OK** when you finish adding devices to the selected resources list.
   - When selecting resources for the group, only valid clients are shown. Checks are made to verify the site code, that the client is installed, and that resources aren't duplicated.

1. On the **Rule Selection** page, select one of the following options:

   - **Allow a percentage of the machines to be updated at the same time**, then select or enter a number for this percentage. Use this setting to allow for future flexibility of the size of the orchestration group. For example, your orchestration group contains 50 devices, and you set this value to 10. During a software update deployment, Configuration Manager allows five devices to simultaneously run the deployment. If you later increase the size of the orchestration group to 100 devices, then 10 devices update at once.

   - **Allow a number of the machines to be updated at the same time**, then select or enter a number for this specific count. Use this setting to always limit to a specific number of devices, whatever the overall size of the orchestration group.

   - **Specify the maintenance sequence**, then sort the selected resources in the proper order. Use this setting to explicitly define the order in which devices run the software update deployment.

1. On the **PreScript** page, enter a PowerShell script to run on each device *before* the deployment runs. The script should return a value of `0` for success, or `3010` for success with restart. Specify a **Script timeout (in seconds)** value, which fails the script if it doesn't complete in the specified time.

1. On the **PostScript** page, enter a PowerShell script to run on each device *after* the deployment runs and a **Script timeout (in seconds)** value. The behavior is otherwise the same as the PreScript.

1. Complete the wizard.
1. You can change the settings of an existing Orchestration Group using **Properties** for the group. 
1. To delete the orchestration group, select it then select **Delete** in the ribbon.

#### View orchestration groups and members

From the **Assets and Compliance** workspace, select the **Orchestration Group** node. To view members, select an orchestration group and select **Show Members** in the ribbon. For more information about the available columns for the nodes, see [Monitor orchestration groups and members](#bkmk_orch_monitor).


#### Start Orchestration

- [Deploy software updates](../../../../../sum/deploy-use/deploy-software-updates.md) to a collection that contains the members of the orchestration group.
   - Orchestration starts when any client in the group tries to install any software update at deadline or during a maintenance window. It starts for the entire group, and makes sure that the devices update by following the orchestration group rules.
- You can manually start orchestration by selecting it from the **Orchestration Group** node, then choosing **Start Orchestration** from the ribbon or right-click menu.  

> [!TIP]
> - Orchestration groups only apply to software update deployments. They don't apply to other deployments.
> - You can right-click on an Orchestration Group member and select **Reset Orchestration Group Member**. This allows you to rerun orchestration.

#### <a name="bkmk_orch_monitor"></a>  Monitoring
Monitor your orchestration groups and members through the Configuration Manager console and the [log files](#log-files).

##### Monitor orchestration groups

From the **Assets and Compliance** workspace, select the **Orchestration Group** node. Add any of the following columns to get information about the groups:

- **Orchestration Name**: The name of your orchestration group.
- **Site Code**: Site code for the group.
- **Orchestration Type**: is one of the following types:
   - Number
   - Percentage
   - Sequence

- **Orchestration Value**: How many members or the percentage of members that can get a lock simultaneously. **Orchestration Value** is only populated when **Orchestration Type** is either *Number* or *Percentage*.  
- **Orchestration State**: In progress during orchestration. Idle when not in progress.
- **Orchestration Start Time**: Date and time that the orchestration started.
- **Current Sequence Number**: Indicates for which member of the group orchestration is active. This number corresponds with the **Sequence Number** for the member.  
- **Orchestration Timeout (in minutes)**: Value of **The Orchestration Group timeout (in minutes)** set on the **General** page when creating the group, or the **General** tab when editing the group.
- **Orchestration Group Member Timeout (in minutes)**: Value of **Orchestration Group member timeout (in minutes)** set on the **General** page when creating the group, or the **General** tab when editing the group.
- **Orchestration Group ID**: ID of the group, The ID is used in logs and the database.
- **Orchestration Group Unique ID**: Unique ID of the group, The Unique ID is used in logs and the database.

##### Monitor orchestration group members

In the **Orchestration Group** node, select an orchestration group. In the ribbon, select **Show Members**. You can see the members of the group, and their orchestration status. Add any of the following columns to get information about the members:

- **Name**: Device name of the orchestration group member
- **Current State**: Gives you the state of the member device. 
   - **In progress** during orchestration.
   - **Waiting**: Indicates the client is waiting on the lock for its turn to install updates. 
   - **Idle** when orchestration is complete or not running.
- **State Code**: You can right-click on the Orchestration Group member and select **Reset Orchestration Group Member**. This reset allows you to rerun orchestration. States include: 
   - Idle
   - Waiting, the device is waiting its turn
   - In progress, installing an update
   - Failed
   - Reboot pending
- **Lock Acquired Time**: Locks are requested by the client based on its policy. Once the client acquires a lock, orchestration is triggered on it.  
-**Last State Reported Time**: Time the member last reported a state.
- **Sequence Number**: The client's location in the queue for installing updates.
- **Site Code**: The site code for the member.
- **Client Activity**: Tells you if the client is active or inactive.
- **Primary User(s)**: Which users are primary for the device.
- **Client Type**: What type of device the client is.
- **Currently Logged on User**: Which user is currently logged on to the device.
- **OG ID**: ID of the orchestration group the member belongs to. 
- **OG Unique ID**: Unique ID of the orchestration group the member belongs to.
- **Resource ID**: Resource ID of the device.

#### Log files
Use the following log files on the site server to help monitor and troubleshoot:

##### Site server
- **Policypv.log**: shows that the site targets the orchestration group to the clients.
- **SMS_OrchestrationGroup.log**: shows the behaviors of the orchestration group.

##### Client

- **MaintenanceCoordinator.log**: Shows the lock acquisition, update installation, pre and post scripts, and lock release process.
- **UpdateDeployment.log**: Shows the update installation process.
- **PolicyAgent.log**: Checks if the client is in an orchestration group. 

#### Orchestration group known issues

- Don't add a machine to more than one orchestration group.
