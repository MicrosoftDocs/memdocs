## <a name="bkmk_tsprogress"></a> Additional improvements to task sequence progress

<!--5932692-->

Based on continued feedback from the community, this release includes further improvements to task sequence progress. Now the count of total steps doesn't include the following items in the task sequence:

- Groups. This item is a container for other steps, not a step itself.

- Instances of the **Run task sequence** step. This step is a container for other steps, so are no longer counted.

- Steps that you explicitly disable. A disabled step doesn't run during the task sequence, so is no longer counted.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Enabled steps in a disabled group are still included in the total count.

For more information, see the following articles:
