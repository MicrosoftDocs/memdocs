## <a name="bkmk_jumplist"></a> OneTrace support for jump lists

<!--6991505-->

[Support Center OneTrace](../../../../support/support-center-onetrace.md) now supports jump lists for recently opened files. Jump lists let you quickly go to previously opened files, so you can work faster.

There are now three methods to open recent files in OneTrace:

- Windows taskbar jump list
- Windows Start menu recently opened list
- In OneTrace from **File** menu or **Recently opened** tab.

### Windows taskbar jump list

When the OneTrace icon is on the Windows taskbar, right-click it, and then select a file from the **Recently opened** list.

### Windows Start menu recently opened list

Go to the **Start** menu, and type `onetrace`. Select a file from the **Recently opened** list.

### OneTrace recently opened list

There are two locations in OneTrace that show the list of recently opened files:

- The **Recently opened** tab in the lower right corner.
- Go to the **File** menu and select a file at the bottom of the menu.
