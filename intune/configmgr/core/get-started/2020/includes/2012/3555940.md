## <a name="bkmk_dashboard"></a> Windows 10 Servicing dashboard changes
<!--3555940-->
Weâ€™ve simplified the Windows 10 Servicing dashboard to make it more relevant. The new **Quality Update Versions** chart displays the top five revisions of Windows 10 across your devices. The **Latest Feature Update** chart shows the number of devices that installed the latest feature update. The **Windows 10 Usage** chart, showing the distribution of Windows 10 major releases, was renamed to **Feature Update Versions**. Servicing plan and Windows 10 ring information were removed from the dashboard.

### Known issues

When a build's revision number is three digits long, you may notice an extraneous dot before the build number in the **Quality Update Versions** chart. When one of these builds from the chart is selected, the temporary node displaying devices with the build will be empty. <!--8861592-->
