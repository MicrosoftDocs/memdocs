## <a name="bkmk_tscheck"></a> Task sequence error shows more check readiness details

<!--8888218-->

Based on your feedback, the task sequence progress can now display more information about readiness checks. If a task sequence fails because the client doesn't meet the requirements configured in the **Check readiness** task sequence step, the user can now see more details about the failed prerequisites. They still see the common "task sequence error" message, but can now select an option to **Inspect**. This action shows the checks that failed on the device.
