## <a name="bkmk_boundary"></a> Show boundary groups for devices

<!--6521835-->

To help you better troubleshoot device behaviors with [boundary groups](../../../../servers/deploy/configure/boundary-groups.md), you can now view the boundary groups for specific devices. In the **Devices** node or when you show the members of a **Device Collection**, add the new **Boundary Group(s)** column to the list view.

- If a device is in more than one boundary group, the value is a comma-separated list of boundary group names.

- The data updates when the client makes a location request to the site, or at most every 24 hours.

- If a client is roaming and not a member of a boundary group, the value is blank.

> [!NOTE]
> This information is site data and only available on primary sites. You won't see a value for this column when you connect the Configuration Manager to a central administration site.
