## <a name="bkmk_atp"></a> Onboard Configuration Manager clients to Microsoft Defender for Endpoint via the Microsoft Intune admin center
<!--5691658-->
You can now deploy Microsoft Defender ATP Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) onboarding policies to Configuration Manager managed clients. These clients don't require Microsoft Entra ID or MDM enrollment, and the policy is targeted at ConfigMgr collections rather than Microsoft Entra groups.

This capability allows customers to manage both Intune MDM and Configuration Manager client EDR/ATP onboarding from a single management experience - the Microsoft Intune admin center.

### Prerequisites

- Access to the [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431).
- An E5 license for [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint](/windows/security/threat-protection/microsoft-defender-atp/minimum-requirements#licensing-requirements).
- A [Microsoft Intune tenant attached](/configmgr/core/get-started/2020/technical-preview-2002-2#bkmk_attach) hierarchy.

### Try it out!

Try to complete the tasks. Then send [Feedback](../../technical-preview-2003.md#bkmk_feedback) with your thoughts on the feature.
