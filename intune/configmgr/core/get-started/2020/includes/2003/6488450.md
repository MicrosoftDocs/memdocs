## <a name="bkmk_smile"></a> Query for feedback sent to Microsoft

<!--6488450-->

Configuration Manager technical preview branch version 2001.2 included a [new status message](../../technical-preview-2001-2.md#bkmk_sendsmile), which has details about feedback sent from the site. To help you more easily find those status messages, this release includes a query, **Feedback sent to Microsoft**.

1. In the Configuration Manager console, go to the **Monitoring** workspace.

1. Expand the **Queries** node, and select the query **Feedback sent to Microsoft**.

1. In the ribbon, on the **Home** tab, in the **Query** group, select **Run**.

### Known issue with query

This query doesn't appear when you upgrade from a previous technical preview branch version. To work around this issue, run the following SQL script on your site database:

```sql
IF EXISTS (SELECT * FROM Queries WHERE QueryKey = N'SMS595')
BEGIN
DELETE FROM Queries WHERE QueryKey = N'SMS595'
END

INSERT INTO Queries (QueryKey, Name, Comments, Architecture, Lifetime, WQL) VALUES ('SMS595', N'Feedback sent to Microsoft', N'Configuration Manager feedback sent to Microsoft for this hierarchy.', 'SMS_StatusMessage', 1, 'select stat.*, ins.*, att1.*, stat.Time from  SMS_StatusMessage as stat left join SMS_StatMsgInsStrings as ins on ins.RecordID = stat.RecordID left join SMS_StatMsgAttributes as att1 on att1.RecordID = stat.RecordID where stat.Time >= ##PRM:SMS_StatusMessage.Time## and (stat.MessageID = 53900 or stat.MessageID = 53901) order by stat.Time DESC')
```
