## <a name="bkmk_tspol"></a> Manage task sequence policy size

<!--6888853-->

Configuration Manager technical preview version 2004 included new [management insight rules for OS deployment](../../technical-preview-2004.md#bkmk_osdmi). These insights help you manage the policy size of task sequences. Large task sequences cause problems with client processing.

To further help manage the size of task sequences, starting in this release Configuration Manager restricts the following actions for a task sequence that's greater than 2 MB in size:

- Save changes in the task sequence editor
- Save changes with PowerShell cmdlets
- Import a new task sequence
- Any other change using supported SDK methods

For example, the task sequence editor will display an error if you try to save changes to a large task sequence.

For more information on how to remediate this issue, see [How to reduce the size of task sequence policy](../../technical-preview-2004.md#how-to-reduce-the-size-of-task-sequence-policy).

> [!TIP]
> This new behavior checks for the 2 MB size limit on the task sequence as stored in the site database. When the client processes the entire task sequence policy, the expanded size can cause problems over 32 MB. The management insights check for the 32 MB task sequence policy size.
