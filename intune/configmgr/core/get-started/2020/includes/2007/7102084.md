## <a name="bkmk_content"></a> Improvements to client data sources dashboard

<!--7102084-->

The [client data sources dashboard](../../../../servers/deploy/configure/monitor-content-you-have-distributed.md#client-data-sources-dashboard) now offers an expanded selection of filters to view information about where clients get content. These new filters include:

- Single boundary group
- All boundary groups
- Internet clients
- Clients not associated with a boundary group

In the Configuration Manager console, go to the **Monitoring** workspace, expand **Distribution Status**, and select the **Client Data Sources** node. By default, the dashboard displays information for a single boundary group. Select another option to update the dashboard. If there's no data available for the selected client group, the chart displays "This data is not yet available."

The dashboard also includes a new tile for **Content downloads using fallback source**. This information helps you understand how often clients download content from an alternate source.
