## General known issues

Upgrading from TP 2311 to 2401 may encounter a prereq check failure if the Resource Access slider is already in Intune. This regression is caused by the previous TP. To resolve this issue, follow these steps:

   - Move any other slider (Apps/Endpoint) to Configuration Manager (CM) or Intune.
   - Choose to apply the changes and click 'Ok.'
   - Proceed with upgrading the site to TP 2401.
   - Once the upgrade is complete, you can revert the (Apps/Endpoint) slider back to its old settings."
