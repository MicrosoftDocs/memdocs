## <a name="bkmk_Bitlock"></a> Improvements to Bitlocker

This release includes the following improvements to Bitlocker:

- Based on your feedback, this feature ensures proper verification of key escrow and prevents message drops. We now validate whether the key is successfully escrowed to the database, and only on successful escrow we add the key protector.
- This feature prevents a potential data loss scenario where BitLocker is protecting the volumes with keys that are never backed up to the database, in any failures to escrow happens.
