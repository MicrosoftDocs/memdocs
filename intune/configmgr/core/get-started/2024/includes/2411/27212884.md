## <a name="bkmk_SQLDep"></a> SQL 2012 and 2014 support are deprecated

Starting with this version, Configuration Manager no longer supports SQL Server 2012 and 2014. Upgrade to the latest SQL Server version or at least SQL Server 2016. If you don’t upgrade, CM upgrades are blocked, and you see an error during the prereq check.
