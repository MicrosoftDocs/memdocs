## <a name="bkmk_hub"></a> Publish query to Community hub from CMPivot

You can now publish a CMPivot query to the Community hub directly from the CMPivot window. Submitting your queries directly through CMPivot makes contributing to the Community hub easier.

   - If needed, install the Microsoft Edge WebView2 extension from the [Configuration Manager console notification](../../../../servers/manage/community-hub.md#bkmk_webview2).
- A GitHub account that's [joined to Community hub](../../../../servers/manage/community-hub-contribute.md#join-the-community-hub-to-contribute-content)
   - You must accept the invitation sent in the email otherwise you won't be able to contribute content.
