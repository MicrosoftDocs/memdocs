## <a name="bkmk_extensions"></a> Require installation of a console extension
<!--10486584-->

You can now require a console extension to be installed before it connects to the site. After you require an extension, it automatically installs for the local console the next time an admin launches it. To require the installation of a console extension:

1. In the Configuration Manager console, go to the **Administration** workspace.
1. Expand **Updates and Servicing** and select the **Console Extensions** node.
1. Select the extension, then select **Require Extension** from either the right-click menu or the ribbon.
   - Selecting **Make Optional** for an extension removes the extension requirement. Console users can still install it locally from the **Console Extensions** node.  
1. The next time the console is launched by a user within the extension's security scope, installation starts automatically.
   - The user launching the console needs local administrator privileges for the extension installation.
