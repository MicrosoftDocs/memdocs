## <a name="bkmk_support"></a> Options for Support Center Data Collector and Client Tools 
<!--9947307-->
The following new command-line options have been added to the [Support Center](../../../../support/support-center-quickstart.md) Data Collector and Client Tools:

|Option| Description | Use case|
|---|---|---|
| `-l` | Specifies to launch as current user without elevation | If `-l` is used, no elevation is requested and local connections are disabled </br></br> `-l` can be used exclusively from `-m` and `-p`. If `-m` and/or `-p` is used without `-l`, elevation will still be requested. |
|`-m <machinename>`| Allows specifying a machine name | If `-m <machinename>` is used, an attempt is made to connect to the specified machine name using integrated authentication (unless `-p` is used) |
|`-p`| Disables integrated authentication| If `-p` is used, the connection screen is launched when the client tools are opened. If used with `-m`, the machine name gets pre-populated with the specified value|
|`--help`| Displays help||

> [!NOTE]
> When using `-m <machinename>`, the account making the connection needs administrator access on the target machine to collect the data.
