## <a name="bkmk_dotnetsdk"></a> External dependencies require .NET 4.6.2

<!--10529267-->

All Configuration Manager libraries are now built using Microsoft .NET Framework version 4.6.2 or later. If you develop an application or tool that depends upon these libraries, it also needs to support .NET 4.6.2 or later. Microsoft recommends using .NET Framework version 4.8.

Applications or tools that use Configuration Manager WMI classes and methods, REST APIs, or PowerShell cmdlets aren't affected.

If you develop a third-party add-on to Configuration Manager, you should test your add-on with every monthly technical preview branch release. Regular testing helps confirm compatibility, and allows for early reporting of any issues with standard interfaces.
