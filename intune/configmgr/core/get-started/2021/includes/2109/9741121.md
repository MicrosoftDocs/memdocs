## <a name="bkmk_import"></a> Import console extensions wizard
<!--9741121, 9761129-->

There's a new wizard for importing [console extensions](../../../../servers/manage/admin-console-extensions.md) that are managed for the hierarchy. You no longer need to use a PowerShell script to import a signed or unsigned console extension.

Import a console extension:

1. From the **Administration** workspace, expand **Updates and Servicing**, then select the **Console Extensions** node.
1. Select **Import Console Extension** from either the ribbon or the right-click menu.
1. When the wizard launches, select **Browse** and navigate to the extension's cab file.
1. If needed, select the option for **Allow extension to be unsigned**.
1. Select **Next** to review the import summary, then complete the wizard to import the extension.

> [!Note] 
> - To import unsigned extensions, the **Hierarchy approved console extensions can be unsigned** option needs to be enabled in the **Hierarchy Settings**. For more information, see [Allow unsigned hierarchy approved console extensions](../../../../servers/manage/admin-console-extensions.md#bkmk_allow-unsigned).
> - If you import an extension into the console, the download will fail if you attempt to download the same extension from the Community hub. To download the same extension from Community hub, delete the imported extension and then download from Community hub. <!--12375723-->
