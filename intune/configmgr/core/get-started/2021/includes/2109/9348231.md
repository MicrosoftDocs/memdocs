## <a name="bkmk_onetrace"></a> Improvements to Support Center Log File Viewer and OneTrace
<!--9348231, 10915091-->
The Support Center [Log File Viewer](../../../../support/support-center.md#support-center-log-file-viewer) and [OneTrace](../../../../support/support-center-onetrace.md) now display status messages in an easy to read format. Entries starting with `>>` are status messages that are automatically converted into a readable format when a log is opened. Search or filter on the `>>` string to find status messages in the log.

> [!TIP]
> When installing Support Center, you can install tools individually. To install only the OneTrace log viewer, use the **Advanced** option when using the [Support Center installer](../../../../support/support-center.md#install) . You can also use the `ADDLOCAL` property, for example `supportcenterinstaller.msi ADDLOCAL=OneTraceApplication`
