## <a name="bkmk_uninstall"></a> Implicit uninstall for user collections

<!--10393847-->

In Configuration Manager current branch version 2107, you can enable an application deployment to support implicit uninstall.

Starting in this release, this behavior also applies to deployments to user collections. If a user is in a collection, the application installs. Then when you remove the user from the collection, the application uninstalls.

For more information, see [implicit uninstall](../../../../../apps/deploy-use/uninstall-applications.md#implicit-uninstall).
