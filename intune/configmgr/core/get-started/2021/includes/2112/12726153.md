## <a name="bkmk_ux"></a> Console and user experience improvements
<!--12726153-->
Based on your feedback, weâ€™ve made a few improvements to the console and user experience.

- When using temporary device nodes, right-click device actions like **Run Scripts** are now available to make the experience in the console consistent
   - For example, if you're in the **Client Health Dashboard** then select a specific version from the **Client Versions** chart, you're taken to a temporary node. The temporary node now has additional actions available from the right-click menu
- Copy/paste is available for more objects from details panes.
   - Added the **Name** property in the details pane for configuration items, configuration item related policies, and applications
- Company portal no longer displays an available package as a featured application
- Software update search results and the search criteria are now cached when you navigate to another node. When you navigate back to the **All Software Updates** node, your search criteria and results are preserved from your last query.
