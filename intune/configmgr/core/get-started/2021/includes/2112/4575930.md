## <a name="bkmk_cmgrc"></a> A new remote assistance tool

<!--4575930-->

As announced at Microsoft Ignite 2021, a public preview of the new remote assistance solution is now available in the Microsoft Intune admin center. This cloud-based tool can help you more securely support users of Windows devices.

This new tool will be the solution for remote control of remote devices. While you can't currently start this tool from the Configuration Manager console, [tenant attach](../../../../../tenant-attach/device-sync-actions.md?toc=/mem/configmgr/cloud-attach/toc.json&bc=/mem/configmgr/cloud-attach/breadcrumb/toc.json) provides the mechanism to eventually provide these Remote Help capabilities.

With the release of this new tool, the Configuration Manager feature for remote control anywhere using cloud management gateway (CMG) won't be available in the next technical preview release.
