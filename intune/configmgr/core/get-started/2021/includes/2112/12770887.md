## <a name="bkmk_maxruntime"></a> Customize maximum run time for other software update types
<!--12770887-->
 Previously, software updates that  didn't belong to the following update categories defaulted to a [maximum run time](../../../../../sum/plan-design/plan-for-software-updates.md#bkmk_maxruntime) of 60 minutes (or 10 minutes prior to version 2103):
- Windows feature updates
- Windows non-feature updates
- Office 365 updates

Starting in this technical preview, you can customize the maximum run time for all other software updates, which includes third-party updates.

### Try it out!

Try to complete the tasks. Then send [Feedback](../../../../understand/product-feedback.md) with your thoughts on the feature.

Change the maximum run time for all other software updates:

1. Go to **Administration** > **Overview** > **Site Configuration** > **Sites** then select the top-level site.
1. From the ribbon, select **Settings** > **Configure Site Components** > **Software Update Point** to open the **Software Update Point Component Properties**.
1. In the **Maximum Run Time** tab, change the following property to a value between 5 and 9999:

   **Maximum run time for all other software updates outside these categories, such as third-party updates (minutes)**

> [!NOTE]
> The new run time for these updates only applies to updates that are newly synchronized after the change. Existing updates that have already been synchronized will not use this value.
