## <a name="bkmk_extensions"></a> Console extension installation
<!--3555909-->
You can now download console extensions from the [Community hub](../../../../servers/manage/community-hub.md) and have it applied to all consoles connected to a hierarchy. This improvement allows you to start managing the approval and installation of console extensions used in your environment. In this technical preview, only [Right Click Tools (Community Edition) from Recast Software](https://www.recastsoftware.com/enterprise?utm_source=microsoft&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=commhub) is available for download and installation. This version of the Right Click Tools extension isn't a final production version. This extension is for technical preview environments only and will expire on April 1, 2021.

### About the Console Extensions node

A new node has been added to the Configuration Manager console. The **Console Extensions** node is located under **Administration** > **Overview** > **Updates and Servicing**. Console extensions downloaded from the community hub will be located here. Actions for console extensions are grouped in the ribbon and the right-click menu.

**Actions for All Sites** group:
- **Approve Installation**: Approves the console extension for installation across all sites. An extension must be approved before notifications are enabled.
- **Revoke Approval**:
   - Revokes the ability to install the extension from the **Console Extensions** node.
   - Notifies then uninstalls existing instances of the extension across the hierarchy at the next launch of a locally installed console.
   - Allows for reapproval of the extension at a later date.
- **Enable Notifications**: Upon next launch of the console, notifies users within the security scope that the extension can be installed.
- **Disable Notifications**: Disables the console notification messages for the extension. Users within the security scope can still install approved extensions from the **Console Extensions** node.  
- **Delete**:
   - Revokes the ability to install the extension from the **Console Extensions** node.
   - Notifies then uninstalls existing instances of the extension across the hierarchy at the next launch of a locally installed console.
   - Removes the extension from the **Console Extensions** node so it can't be reapproved later.

**Classify** group:

- **Set Security Scopes**: Set the [security scopes](../../../../understand/fundamentals-of-role-based-administration.md#security-scopes) to secure the object and limit access.

**Local Extension** group:

- **Install**: Installs the selected extension for the current local console
- **Uninstall**: Uninstalls the selected extension from the current local console
