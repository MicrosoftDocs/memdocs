### <a name="ki_memac"></a> Issue with Microsoft Intune admin center notifications with version 2102
<!--9328605-->

Following the release of technical preview version 2102, there's an issue with Microsoft Intune admin center notifications. You can still onboard a version 2102 site for tenant attach, but the cloud console will show an on-premises error.

To resolve this issue, update your technical preview site to version 2103.
