### <a name="ki_cmg"></a> Known issue with a CMG deployed using classic cloud services

<!--9888296-->

If you have a cloud management gateway (CMG) deployed using classic cloud services, after you upgrade the site to technical preview branch version 2105, the CMG web role repeatedly restarts and fails to start. The CMG status in the Configuration Manager console remains at **Upgrading** or **Provisioning**. You'll see entries similar to the following lines from the SMS_CLOUD_SERVICES_MANAGER repeated in the **cloudmgr.log**:

```log
Deployment instance status for service <name> is BusyRole.
Deployment instance status for service <name> is RestartingRole.
```

This issue doesn't affect CMGs deployed with a virtual machine scale set.
