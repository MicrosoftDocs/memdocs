## <a name="bkmk_console"></a> Console improvements

<!--9575773-->

Based on your feedback, this release includes the following improvements to the Configuration Manager console:

- When you show the members of a device collection, and select a device in the list, switch to the **Collections** tab in the details pane. This new view shows the list of collections of which the selected device is a member. It makes it easier for you to see this information.<!-- 10480635 -->

- When viewing a collection, you could previously see the amount of time the site took to evaluate the collection membership. This data is now also available in the **Monitoring** workspace.<!-- 9648622 --> When you select a collection in either subnode of the **Collection Evaluation** node, the details pane displays this collection evaluation time data.
