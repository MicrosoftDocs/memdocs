## <a name="bkmk_tpm"></a> Task sequence check for TPM 2.0

<!--9575077-->

To help you better deploy Windows 11, the [Check Readiness](../../../../../osd/understand/task-sequence-steps.md#BKMK_CheckReadiness) step in the task sequence now includes checks for TPM 2.0.

- **TPM 2.0 or above is enabled**: Checks whether the device that's running the task sequence has a TPM 2.0 that's enabled.
- **TPM 2.0 or above is activated**: If the device has an enabled TPM 2.0, check that it's activated.

The task sequence smsts.log file also shows the TPM version.
