<!--8272488-->

Starting in this technical preview, the **Content** view in the **Support Center Client Tools** has been renamed to **Deployments**.  From **Deployments**, you can review all of the deployments currently targeted to the device. The new view is grouped by **Category** and **Status**. The view can be sorted and filtered to help you find the deployments you're interested in. Select a deployment in the results pane to display more information in the details pane.
