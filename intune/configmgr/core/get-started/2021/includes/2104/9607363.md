## <a name="bkmk_cmtrace"></a> Improvements to CMTrace

<!--9607363-->

This release includes multiple performance improvements to the CMTrace log viewer. Configuration Manager automatically installs this tool in the following locations:

- The site server's tools directory. For example: `cd.latest\SMSSETUP\Tools\CMTrace.exe`
- The Management point's installation directory. For example: `C:\SMS_CCM\CMTrace.exe`
- The client installation directory. For example: `C:\Windows\CCM\CMTrace.exe`
- OS deployment boot images. For example: `X:\sms\bin\x64\CMTrace.exe`

If you have a copy of CMTrace in another location, consider removing it and using a copy in one of the default paths. If it's in a custom location that meets your business requirements, then make sure you have a process to keep it up to date. If your custom location might be of benefit to other customers, file [product feedback](../../../../understand/find-help.md#product-feedback).

For more information, see [Direct links to Community hub items](../../../../servers/manage/community-hub.md#bkmk_deeplink).

> [!TIP]
> **OneTrace** is the log viewer with Support Center. It works similarly to CMTrace, with many improvements. For more information, see [Support Center OneTrace](../../../../support/support-center-onetrace.md).
