## <a name="bkmk_sql2012"></a> New prerequisite check for SQL Server 2012

<!--10092858-->

When you install or update the site, it now warns for the presence of SQL Server 2012. The [support lifecycle](/lifecycle/products/microsoft-sql-server-2012) for SQL Server 2012 ends on July 12, 2022. Plan to upgrade database servers in your environment, including SQL Server Express at secondary sites.
