## <a name="bkmk_adr"></a> Improvements for managing automatic deployment rules

The following items were added to help you better manage your automatic deployment rules:

### Updated Product parameter for New-CMSoftwareUpdateAutoDeploymentRule cmdlet
<!--9247522-->
The `-Product` parameter for `New-CMSoftwareUpdateAutoDeploymentRule` was updated. When there are multiple products with the same name, `-Product` now selects all of them.

### Script to apply deployment package settings for automatic deployment rule
<!--3961933, 4396422-->
If you create an ADR with the **No deployment package** option, you're' unable to go back and add one later. To help you resolve this issue, we've uploaded the following script into [Community hub](../../../../servers/manage/community-hub.md):

   > [!TIP]
   > For more information, see [Direct links to Community hub items](../../../../servers/manage/community-hub.md).

```powershell
<# Apply-ADRDeploymentPackageSettings #>

#=============================================
# START SCRIPT
#=============================================
param
(
[parameter(Mandatory = $true)]
[ValidateNotNullOrEmpty()]
[string]$sourceADRName,

[parameter(Mandatory = $true)]
[ValidateNotNullOrEmpty()]
[string]$targetADRName
)

Try {
       # Source ADR that already has the needed deployment package. You may need to create one if it doesn’t exist.
       $sourceADR = Get-CMSoftwareUpdateAutoDeploymentRule -Name $sourceADRName

       # Target ADR that will be updated to use the source ADR’s deployment package. Typically, this is the ADR that used the “No deployment package” option. 
       $targetADR = Get-CMSoftwareUpdateAutoDeploymentRule -Name $targetADRName

       # Apply the deployment package settings
       $targetADR.ContentTemplate = $sourceADR.ContentTemplate

       # Update the wmi object
       $targetADR.Put()
}
Catch{
       $exceptionDetails = "Exception: " + $_.Exception.Message + "HResult: " + $_.Exception.HResult
       Write-Error "Failed to apply ADR deployment package settings: $exceptionDetails"
}
