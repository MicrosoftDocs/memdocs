## <a name="bkmk_audit"></a> Audit mode for potentially unwanted applications
<!--9249870-->

An **Audit** option for [potentially unwanted applications (PUA)](/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/detect-block-potentially-unwanted-apps-microsoft-defender-antivirus) was added in the **Antimalware policy** settings. Use PUA protection in audit mode to detect potentially unwanted applications without blocking them. PUA protection in audit mode is useful if your company is conducting an internal software security compliance check and you'd like to avoid any false positives.

To use the **Audit** option for potentially unwanted applications:

1. Go to **Assets and Compliance** > **Endpoint Protection** > **Antimalware policy**.
1. Choose the set of antimalware policies you want to change, or create a new custom antimalware policy.  
1. Select the [**Real-time protection**](../../../../../protect/deploy-use/endpoint-antimalware-policies.md#real-time-protection-settings) settings page.
1. Set the **Configure detection for potentially unwanted applications** setting to **Audit**.
