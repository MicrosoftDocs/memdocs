## <a name="bkmk_encrypt"></a> Client encryption uses AES-256

<!--10129759-->

Starting in this release, when you enable the site to **Use encryption**, the client uses the **AES-256** algorithm. This setting requires clients to encrypt inventory data and state messages before it sends to the management point. For more information, see [Plan for security - signing and encryption](../../../../plan-design/security/plan-for-security.md#signing-and-encryption).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To take full advantage of new Configuration Manager features, after you update the site, also update clients to the latest version. While new functionality appears in the Configuration Manager console when you update the site and console, the complete scenario isn't functional until the client version is also the latest.
>
> If you don't update the client to the latest version, it continues to use the 3DES algorithm.

> [!NOTE]
> To encrypt the data, the client uses the public key of the management point's encryption certificate. Only the management point has the corresponding private key, so only it can decrypt the data.
>
> The client bootstraps this certificate with the management point's signing certificate, which it bootstraps with the site's trusted root key. Make sure to securely provision the trusted root key on clients. For more information, see [Plan for security - the trusted root key](../../../../plan-design/security/plan-for-security.md#the-trusted-root-key).
