## <a name="bkmk_cmg"></a> Convert a CMG to virtual machine scale set

<!--8959690-->

Starting in current branch version 2010, you could deploy the cloud management gateway (CMG) with a virtual machine scale set in Azure. This support was primarily to unblock customers with a Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) subscription.

In this release, any customer with a CMG that uses the classic cloud service deployment can convert to a virtual machine scale set.

> [!TIP]
> This process reuses the underlying storage account.

When you convert a CMG, you can't change all settings:

| Setting | Changeable |
|---------|---------|
| Azure environment | :::image type="icon" source="../../media/red-x.png" border="false"::: |
| Subscription | :::image type="icon" source="../../media/red-x.png" border="false"::: |
| Microsoft Entra app | :::image type="icon" source="../../media/red-x.png" border="false"::: |
| Region | :::image type="icon" source="../../media/red-x.png" border="false"::: |
| Resource group | :::image type="icon" source="../../media/red-x.png" border="false"::: |
| VM size <sup>[Note](#bkmk_note1)</sup> | :::image type="icon" source="../../media/green-check.png" border="false"::: |
| VM instances | :::image type="icon" source="../../media/green-check.png" border="false"::: |
| Verify CRL | :::image type="icon" source="../../media/green-check.png" border="false"::: |
| Require TLS | :::image type="icon" source="../../media/green-check.png" border="false"::: |
| Serve content | :::image type="icon" source="../../media/green-check.png" border="false"::: |

To make changes that the conversion process doesn't support, you need to [Redeploy the service](../../../../clients/manage/cmg/modify-cloud-management-gateway.md).

> [!NOTE]
> Starting in technical preview branch version 2105, you could [select the VM size for a CMG](../../technical-preview-2105.md#bkmk_cmgsize). In this release, the **Large** option is now the **A4_V2** VM size. This change is based on performance testing and VM cost consideration.<!-- 10107298 -->

### Try it out!

Try to complete the tasks. Then send [Feedback](../../../../understand/product-feedback.md) with your thoughts on the feature.

1. In the Configuration Manager console, go to the **Administration** workspace, expand **Cloud Services**, and select the **Cloud Management Gateway** node.

1. Select a CMG instance whose **Status** is _Ready_. In the ribbon, select **Convert**. This action opens the Convert CMG wizard.

1. On the General page, select **Next**. You can't change any of these settings.

1. On the Settings page, note the new _Deployment name_ with the suffix for the virtual machine scale set.

1. Make other configuration changes as needed. Then select **Next** and complete the wizard.

Monitor the conversion process the same as a new deployment. For example, view the state in the console, and review **cloudmgr.log**. For more information, see [Monitor CMG](../../../../clients/manage/cmg/monitor-clients-cloud-management-gateway.md#monitor-logs).

### Update or create a DNS CNAME

Since the deployment name changed, you need to update or create a DNS canonical name record (CNAME). This alias maps the service name to the deployment name. For more information, see [Create a DNS CNAME alias](../../../../clients/manage/cmg/server-auth-cert.md#create-a-dns-cname-alias).

For example,

- The CMG's _service name_ is either `GraniteFalls.contoso.com` or `GraniteFalls.cloudapp.net`, which typically depends upon the [certificate type](../../../../clients/manage/cmg/server-auth-cert.md#summary-comparison-of-certificate-types).
- For the _deployment name_,
  - Classic: `GraniteFalls.cloudapp.net`
  - Virtual machine scale set: `GraniteFalls.EastUS.CloudApp.Azure.Com`
