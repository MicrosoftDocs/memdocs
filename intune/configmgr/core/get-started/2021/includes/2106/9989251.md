## <a name="bkmk_catalogs"></a> List additional third-party updates catalogs
<!--9989251-->
To help you find custom catalogs that you can import for third-party software updates, there's now a documentation page with links to catalog providers. Choose **More Catalogs** from the ribbon in the **Third-party software update catalogs** node. Right-clicking on **Third-Party Software Update Catalogs** node also displays a **More Catalogs** menu item.  Selecting **More Catalogs** opens a link to a documentation page containing a [list of additional third-party software update catalog providers](../../../../../sum/deploy-use/third-party-software-update-catalogs.md).
