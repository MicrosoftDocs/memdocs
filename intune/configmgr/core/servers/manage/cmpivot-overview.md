# CMPivot overview

*Applies to: Configuration Manager (current branch)*

CMPivot allows you to quickly assess the state of devices in your environment and take action. When you enter a query, CMPivot will run a query in real time on all currently connected devices in the selected collection. The data returned can then be filtered, grouped, and refined to answer business questions, troubleshoot issues in your environment, or respond to security threats. For more information about using CMPivot, see [Use CMPivot](cmpivot.md).
