# Manage Configuration Manager console extensions

*Applies to: Configuration Manager (current branch)*

Starting in Configuration Manager 2103, the **Console extensions** node allows you to start managing the approval and installation of console extensions used in your environment. Having extensions in the console doesn't make them immediately available. From a high level, the steps are:

1. An administrator has to approve an extension for the site
1. The administrator has to enable notifications for the extension.
1. The console users can then install the extension to their local console.

After you approve an extension, when you open the console, you'll see a [console notification](#bkmk_notification). From the notification, you can start the extension installer, or use the **Install** option from the **Console extensions** node. After the installer completes, the console restarts automatically, and you can use the extension.

The old style of console extensions will start being phased out in favor of the new style since they're more secure and centrally managed. The new style of console extensions has the following benefits:

- Centralized management of console extensions for the site instead of manually placing binaries on individual consoles.
- A clear separation of console extensions from different extension providers.
- The ability for admins to have more control over which console extensions are loaded and used in the environment, to keep them more secure.
- A hierarchy setting that allows for only using the new style of console extension.
   > [!Important]
   > If this setting is used, your old style extensions that aren't approved through the **Console Extensions** node will no longer be able to be used. The setting, **Only allow console extensions that are approved for the hierarchy**, is `enabled` by default if you installed from the [2103 baseline image](updates.md#bkmk_Baselines). The setting remains `disabled` by default, if you upgraded from a version prior to 2103. If the setting was enabled in error, disabling the setting allows the old style extensions to be used again.

## Prerequisites

The Configuration Manager console needs to be able to connect to the [administration service](../../../develop/adminservice/set-up.md) and the administration service needs to be functional. <!--1104776-->

[!INCLUDE [console extensions node](includes/console-extensions-node.md)]

## Get console extensions

There are three ways to get the new style of hierarchy approved console extensions into Configuration Manager:

- An extension may come with Configuration Manager, such as WebView2
- [Download console extensions from Community hub](community-hub-extensions.md)
- [Import console extensions](import-admin-console-extensions.md)


[!INCLUDE [console extensions local install](includes/console-extensions-local-install.md)]


[!INCLUDE [console extensions enable notification](includes/console-extensions-enable-notification.md)]

[!INCLUDE [Allow unsigned console extensions notifications](includes/console-extensions-allow-unsigned.md)]


## Require installation of a console extension
<!--10486584-->
*(Introduced in 2111)*

Starting in Configuration Manager version 2111, you can require a console extension to be installed before it connects to the site. After you require an extension, it automatically installs for the local console the next time an admin launches it. To require the installation of a console extension:

1. In the Configuration Manager console, go to the **Administration** workspace.
1. Expand **Updates and Servicing** and select the **Console Extensions** node.
1. Select the extension, then select **Require Extension** from either the right-click menu or the ribbon.
   - Selecting **Make Optional** for an extension removes the extension requirement. Console users can still install it locally from the **Console Extensions** node.
1. The next time the console is launched by a user within the extension's security scope, installation starts automatically.
   - The user launching the console needs local administrator privileges for the extension installation.

[!INCLUDE [console extensions notifications](includes/console-extensions-notifications.md)]

## Status messages for console extensions
<!--11048976-->
*(Introduced in 2111)*

Starting in version 2111, the site creates status messages for events related to console extensions. Status messages improve the visibility and transparency of console extensions that are used with your site. Use these status messages to make sure your site uses known and trusted console extensions. The status messages have IDs from **54201** to **54208**. They all include the following information:

- The user that made the change
- The ID of the extension
- The version of the extension

There are four categories of message events:

- Required or optional
- Approve or disapprove
- Enable or disable
- Tombstone or untombstone

For example, the description of status message ID **54201** is **User `"%1"` made console extension with ID `"%2"` and version `"%3"` required**.
