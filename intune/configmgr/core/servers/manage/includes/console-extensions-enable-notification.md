## <a name="bkmk_enable-notifications"></a> Enable user notifications for extension installation

1. If needed, modify the security scopes for the extension to allow access by more admins. These admins will be targeted with the in-console notification for installing the extension.
1. Select **Enable Notifications**.
1. Launch a Configuration Manager console that doesn't have the extension installed. Ideally, use a test account that you gave access to when you modified the security scope.
1. Verify that the notification for the extension occurs and that you can install the extension.
