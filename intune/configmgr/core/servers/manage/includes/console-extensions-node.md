## About the Console Extensions node
<!--3555909-->
(*Introduced in version 2103*)

The **Console Extensions** node is located under **Administration** > **Overview** > **Updates and Servicing**. Actions for console extensions are grouped in the ribbon and the right-click menu. Console extensions downloaded from [Community hub](../community-hub-extensions.md) will be shown here.

**Actions for Console Extensions** group:
- **Refresh**: Refreshes the node
- **Import Console Extension**: Launches the [Import Console Extension wizard](../import-admin-console-extensions.md#bkmk_wizard) (added in 2111)

**Actions for All Sites** group:
- **Approve Installation**: Approves the console extension for installation across all sites. An extension must be approved before notifications are enabled.
- **Revoke Approval**:
   - Revokes the ability to install the extension from the **Console Extensions** node.
   - Notifies then uninstalls existing instances of the extension across the hierarchy at the next launch of a locally installed console.
   - Allows for reapproval of the extension at a later date.
- **Enable Notifications**: Upon next launch of the console, notifies users within the security scope that the extension can be installed.
- **Disable Notifications**: Disables the console notification messages for the extension. Users within the security scope can still install approved extensions from the **Console Extensions** node.
- **Require Extension** (added in 2111): Automatically installs the extension for users within the security scope on the next launch before connecting to the site. The user launching the console needs local administrator privileges for the extension installation. <!--10486584-->
- **Make Optional** (added in 2111): Removes the requirement for an extension. Console users can still install the extension locally from the **Console Extensions** node.  <!--10486584--> 
- **Delete**:
   - Revokes the ability to install the extension from the **Console Extensions** node.
   - Notifies then uninstalls existing instances of the extension across the hierarchy at the next launch of a locally installed console.
   - Removes the extension from the **Console Extensions** node so it can't be reapproved later.

**Classify** group:

- **Set Security Scopes**: Set the [security scopes](../../../understand/fundamentals-of-role-based-administration.md#security-scopes) to secure the object and limit access.

**Local Extension** group:

- **Install**: Installs the selected extension for the current local console
- **Uninstall**: Uninstalls the selected extension from the current local console

> [!NOTE]
> - The WebView2 console extension is approved by default to enable using Community hub. The files are automatically downloaded from `https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/webview2/#download-section` with the other redistributable files.
> - When you upgrade to Configuration Manager 2107, you will be prompted to install the WebView2 console extension again. <!--10247811, 10005418-->

## Enable hierarchy approved console extensions

1. In the Configuration Manager console, go to the **Administration** workspace, expand **Site Configuration**, and select **Sites**.
1. Select **Hierarchy Settings** from the ribbon.
1. On the **General** tab, enable or disable the **Only allow console extensions that are approved for the hierarchy** option.
1. Select **Ok** when done to close the **Hierarchy Settings Properties**.

> [!WARNING]
> If this setting is `enabled`, your old style extensions that aren't approved through the **Console Extensions** node will no longer be able to be used. The setting, **Only allow console extensions that are approved for the hierarchy**, is `enabled` by default if you installed from the [2103 baseline image](../updates.md#bkmk_Baselines). The setting remains `disabled` by default, if you upgraded from a version prior to 2103. If the setting was enabled in error, disabling the setting allows the old style extensions to be used again.
