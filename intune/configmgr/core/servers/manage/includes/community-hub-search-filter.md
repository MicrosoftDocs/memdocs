When filtering Community hub items in search:
- The filtering on some items is done using `like` so you don't need to know the exact name of an item you are trying to find. For instance, using `type:task` would return task sequences.
- You can't use the same filter twice in a search. For instance, using `type:report` and `type:extension` would only return reports since the second filter gets ignored.
- Search filtering respects the hierarchy setting for displaying [Community hub content categories](../community-hub.md#bkmk_category).
  - If your hierarchy is set to **Display Microsoft and curated community content**, then `curated:false` is ignored.
  - If your hierarchy is set to **Display Microsoft content**, then the `curated:` filter is ignored.
- Starting in version 2203, the console displays a list of search filters you can use in Community hub.
