# Prerequisite Checker for Configuration Manager

*Applies to: Configuration Manager (current branch)*

Before you run Setup to install or upgrade a Configuration Manager site, or before you install a site system role on a new server, you can use this stand-alone application (**Prereqchk.exe**) from the version of Configuration Manager that you want use to verify server readiness. Use Prerequisite Checker to identify and fix problems that would block a site or site system role installation.

> [!NOTE]
> Prerequisite Checker always runs as part of Setup.

By default, when Prerequisite Checker runs:

- It validates the server where it runs.
- The local computer is scanned for an existing site server, and only the checks that are applicable to the site are run.
- If no existing sites are detected, all prerequisite rules are run.
- It checks rules to verify that software and settings required for setup are installed. It's possible that some prerequisites require other configurations or software updates that the tool doesn't check.
- It logs its results in the **ConfigMgrPrereq.log** file on the system drive of the computer. The log file might contain more information that doesn't appear in the tool.

When you run Prerequisite Checker at a command prompt and specify specific command-line options:

- Prerequisite Checker only runs the checks that are associated with the site server or site systems that you specify in the command line.
- To check a remote computer, your user account must have Administrator rights to the remote computer.

For more information, see [List of prerequisite checks](list-of-prerequisite-checks.md).

## Source folders

By default, the prerequisite checker tool is in one of the following locations:

- `<Configuration Manager installation media>\SMSSETUP\BIN\X64`
- `<Configuration Manager installation path>\BIN\X64`

## Copy to another computer

1. In Windows Explorer, go to one of the `X64` source folders.

1. Copy the following files to the destination folder on the other computer:

    - prereqchk.exe
    - prereqcore.dll
    - prereqchkres.dll
      This file is in the subfolder for the install language. For example, English is in the `00000409` subfolder. <!--586808-->
    - basesql.dll
    - basesvr.dll
    - baseutil.dll

## Run with default checks

1. In Windows Explorer, go to one of the `X64` source folders.

1. Run **prereqchk.exe** to start Prerequisite Checker.

  > [!NOTE]
  > The tool requires administrative permissions on the local computer.

Prerequisite Checker detects existing sites, and if found, runs the checks for upgrade readiness. If no sites are found, it runs all checks. The **Site Type** column provides information about the site server or site system with which the rule is associated.

In the Prerequisite Checker user interface, Prerequisite Checker creates a list of discovered problems in the **Prerequisite result** section.

- Select an item in the list for details about how to resolve the problem.
- Before you install the component, resolve all items in the list that have an **Error** status.
- To review results after you close the tool, open the **ConfigMgrPrereq.log** file in the root of the system drive. The log file might contain more information that's not displayed in the tool.

## Run from a command prompt

1. Open a Windows command prompt as an administrator and change directory to one of the `X64` source folders.

1. To start Prerequisite Checker and run all prerequisite checks on the server, run the following command: `prereqchk.exe /LOCAL`

You can also run it with other command-line options. For example, to check a primary site:

`prereqchk.exe /PRI /SQL sql01.contoso.com /SDK cmprov01.contoso.com /JOIN cas.contoso.com /MP mp01.contoso.com /DP dp01.contoso.com`
