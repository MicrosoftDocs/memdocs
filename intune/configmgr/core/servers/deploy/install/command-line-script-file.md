# Unattended setup script file keys

*Applies to: Configuration Manager (current branch)*

This article defines all of the keys and values to specify in the `.ini` installation script file. Use this file with the `/SCRIPT` command-line option to do an unattended installation or recovery of a Configuration Manager site. The tables in this article show:

- The available setup script keys and their corresponding values
- If they're required
- Which type of installation they're used for
- A short description of the key

For more information, see the following articles:

- [Command-line overview](use-a-command-line-to-install-sites.md)
- [Setup command-line options](command-line-options-for-setup.md)

Specify the section names in square brackets (`[]`): `[<Section name>]`. For example, `[Identification]`.

When you provide values for keys, the name of the key must be followed by an equal sign (`=`) and the value for the key: `<Key name>=<Value>`. For example, `CDLatest=1`. Make sure the keys are under the appropriate section.

Each section and each value needs to be unique in a single script. For example, there can only be one `[Identification]` section and only one `Action` key.

## Supported actions

A script is primarily defined by the `Action` key in the `Identification` section. The following list includes all of the currently supported actions for running setup unattended:

- `InstallCAS`: Install a central administration site (CAS)
- `InstallPrimarySite`: Install a primary site
- `ManageLanguages`: Add or remove client and server languages
- `RecoverPrimarySite`: Recovery a primary site
- `RecoverCCAR`: Recover a CAS

## Install a site

#### <a name="bkmk_note2"></a> Note 2: `CDLatest` required

The `CDLatest` key is only required when you run setup from the `CD.Latest` folder to install a *primary site* or a *central administration site*. For more information, see [About the command-line script file](use-a-command-line-to-install-sites.md#about-the-command-line-script-file).

#### <a name="bkmk_note3"></a> Note 3: `CDLatest` required

The `CDLatest` key is only required when you run setup from the `CD.Latest` folder to recover a site. For more information, see [About the command-line script file](use-a-command-line-to-install-sites.md#about-the-command-line-script-file).

### `RecoveryOptions` section for site recovery

Include the following keys in the `RecoveryOptions` section to recover a site:

| Key name | Required | Values | Details |
|----------|----------|--------|---------|
| `ServerRecoveryOptions` | Yes | - `1`: Site server and SQL Server<br>- `2`: Site server only<br>- `4`: SQL Server only | What components to recover. <sup>[See note 4](#bkmk_note4)</sup> |

#### <a name="bkmk_note4"></a> Note 4: `ServerRecoveryOptions` value notes

- `1` or `2`: To recover the site by using a site backup, specify a value for `SiteServerBackupLocation`. If you don't specify a value, setup reinstalls the site without restoring it from a backup set.

- `4`: The `BackupLocation` key is required when you configure a value of `10` for the `DatabaseRecoveryOptions` key, which is to restore the site database from backup.

#### <a name="bkmk_note5"></a> Note 5: `ReferenceSite` value notes

- If the database backup is older than the change-tracking retention period, or when you recover the site without a backup, specify the reference primary site that the CAS uses to recover global data.

- When you don't specify a reference site, and the backup is older than the change-tracking retention period, all primary sites are reinitialized with the restored data from the CAS.

- When you don't specify a reference site, and the backup is within the change-tracking retention period, only changes that are made after the backup are replicated from primary sites. When there are conflicting changes from different primary sites, the CAS uses the first one that it receives.
