# Where to get installation media for Configuration Manager

*Applies to: Configuration Manager (current branch)*

If you have Configuration Manager volume licenses with Software Assurance, or if you have purchased licenses for Configuration Manager volume licenses, you can download baseline source media to install Configuration Manager from the [Volume Licensing Service Center](https://www.microsoft.com/Licensing/servicecenter/default.aspx).

If you have a Configuration Manager license from EMS, Microsoft 365, or a Cloud Solution Provider (CSP), please see the [Product and Licensing FAQ](../../../understand/product-and-licensing-faq.yml#i-have-purchased-ems-or-microsoft-365-through-a-cloud-solution-provider--csp---do-i-have-rights-to-use-configuration-manager-).


If you would like to purchase volume licenses for Configuration Manager, contact your preferred Microsoft Reseller or see [How to purchase through Volume Licensing](https://www.microsoft.com/Licensing/how-to-buy/how-to-buy.aspx). You can also download media to install an evaluation edition of Configuration Manager from the [Evaluation Center](https://www.microsoft.com/evalcenter/download-microsoft-endpoint-configuration-manager) website.


<!--
> [!NOTE]
> The Evaluation Center is currently unavailable. As a workaround you can download the ConfigMgr 2203 Current Branch Eval exe here : ( https://aka.ms/MECM2203CB-Eval).
