# What's new in version 2503 of Configuration Manager current branch

*Applies to: Configuration Manager (current branch)*

Update 2503 for Configuration Manager current branch is available as an in-console update. Apply this update on sites that run version 2309 or later.

Always review the latest checklist for installing this update. For more information, see [Checklist for installing update 2503](../../servers/manage/checklist-for-installing-update-2503.md). After you update a site, also review the [Post-update checklist](../../servers/manage/checklist-for-installing-update-2503.md#post-update-checklist).

To take full advantage of new Configuration Manager changes, after you update the site, also update clients to the latest version. New functionality appears in the Configuration Manager console when you update the site and console, but the complete scenario isn't functional until the client version is also the latest.
