Starting in Configuration Manager version 2111, the co-management onboarding experience changed. The Cloud Attach Configuration Wizard makes it easier to enable co-management and other cloud features. You can choose a streamlined set of recommended defaults, or customize your cloud attach features. There's also a new built-in device collection for **Co-management Eligible Devices** to help you identify clients. For more information on enabling co-management, see [Enable cloud attach](../../cloud-attach/enable.md).

> [!NOTE]
> With the new wizard, you don't move workloads at the same time that you enable co-management. To move workloads, you'll edit the co-management properties after enabling cloud attach.
