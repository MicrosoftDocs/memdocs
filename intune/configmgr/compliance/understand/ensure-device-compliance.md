# Ensure device compliance with Configuration Manager

*Applies to: Configuration Manager (current branch)*

Compliance settings in Configuration Manager gives you the tools and resources you need to manage the configuration and compliance of devices in your organization. This helps you support the following business requirements:  

-   Compare the configuration of Windows PCs, Macs computers, servers, and mobile devices you manage against best practices configurations you create, or obtain from other vendors  

-   Identify unauthorized device configurations  

-   Report compliance with regulatory policies and in-house security policies  

-   Identify security vulnerabilities  

-   Provide the help desk with the information to detect probable causes of reported incidents and problems by identifying noncompliant configurations  

-   Automatically remediate some noncompliant settings on mobile devices  

-   Remediate noncompliance by deploying applications, packages and programs, or scripts to a collection that is automatically populated with devices that report that they are out of compliance
