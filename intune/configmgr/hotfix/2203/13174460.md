   KB [12896009](../../hotfix/2111/12896009.md): Update rollup for Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager current branch, version 2111

## Issues that are fixed
<!-- 2837936 -->
- The collection evaluation process is optimized during startup of the SMS_Executive service (*smsexec.exe*) to reduce the overall time required to complete evaluations.
<!-- 3305474 -->
- The SMS Agent Host service (*CCMExec.exe*) hangs in a **Stop Pending** state on clients that are also configured as pull-distribution points. When this issue happens, the thread count for CCMExec.exe in Task Manager will show over 500 threads.
<!-- 5094600 -->
- The **Get-CMSoftwareUpdateDeployment** and **Get-CMSoftwareUpdateDeploymentStatus** PowerShell cmdlets don't run as expected under the context of an account with the Software Update Manager role.
<!-- 5904616 -->
- SQL queries against the **vLogs** view can fail with an XML parsing error which delays data replication service troubleshooting efforts.
<!-- 9196080 -->
- The FailoverManager.log file is improved to remove ambiguous log entries related to site certificates.
<!-- 10266992 -->
- State message processing is now more resilient to intermittent SQL errors.
<!-- 10565692 -->
- The Client Health Dashboard is updated to reduce false negatives related to status messages.
<!-- 11047682 -->
- The Distribution Manager component of the SMS_Executive service on a child site makes unnecessary network calls back to the parent site for package source details such as file size. This delays package processing times in environments with a large number of packages and/ or distribution points across a hierarchy.
<!-- 11155525 -->
- The content size filter for an automated deployment rule doesn't return any results when an exact value is used instead of a comparison, such as greater than or less than.
<!-- 12505551 -->
- User available programs are incorrectly shown under the Featured section in the company portal.
<!-- 12570698 -->
- Opening a software center notification from the system tray icon bypasses the high impact task sequence notification.
<!-- 12590180 -->
- Starting with Configuration Manager current branch, version 2107, newly installed workgroup clients aren't automatically approved as expected in environments using PKI-issues certificates.
<!-- 12708814 -->
- Co-managed clients no longer receive Intune Win32 content via the Microsoft Connected Cache feature.
<!-- 12727584 -->
- Clients fail to receive policy data during an operating system deployment scenario when the dynamic media was created at one site, but the client is within the boundaries of a different site.
<!-- 12873596 -->
- Automated queries against the **SMSCOMPONENTS** WMI class may eventually fail. Event ID 5612 is generated with text resembling the following:
   ```text
   Wmiprvse.exe exceeded handle quota limit
   WMI has stopped WMIPRVSE.EXE because a quota reached a warning value. Quota: PrivatePageCount
   ```
<!-- 12917816 -->
- The **Recommended version of Microsoft .NET Framework** prerequisite checker warning is updated to clarify requirements.
<!-- 12953268 -->
- Files larger than 4GB fail to download from a cloud management gateway when the **BranchCache** feature is enabled. The DTS.log on the client contains an error resembling the following:
   ```text
   Failed to add file C:\Windows\ccmcache\{content_path}\sources/{filename} to range download. Error - 0x8020002c
   ```
<!-- 13008375 -->
- Operating system deployment task sequences may fail to put the Configuration Manager client into provisioning mode due to a timing issue. This can lead to application installation failures, unintended client patching, or other unexpected side effects. When this happens, the SMSTS.log file contains the following:
   ```text
   Failed to create instance of progress UI (0x80040154)
   ```
<!-- 13028713 -->
- Improvements for readability are made to the UpdateDeployment and DCMAgent log files.
<!-- 13034131 -->
- The SMS Agent Host service (CCMExec.exe) takes up more memory than expected on a management point if there's a problem reading the *\{MP_installation_directory}\Statistic\CurrentData* file. With verbose debug logging enabled, the CCMStatistics.log contains entries resembling the following:
   ```text
   Statistic initialization failed 0x87d00217
   ```
<!-- 13089286 -->
- Logging for Active Directory discovery methods is improved to include more precise troubleshooting information, such as specific error codes if domain names fail to resolve.
<!-- 13106423 -->
- CMPivot and the Microsoft Edge installer are currently signed with the **Microsoft Code Signing PCA 2011** certificate. If you set PowerShell execution policy to **AllSigned**, then you need to make sure that devices trust this signing certificate. You can now export the certificate from a computer where you've installed a Configuration Manager version 2203 site server. View the certificate on *SMSInstallDir*\cd.latest\SMSSETUP\BIN\X64\CMPivot.ps1, and then export the code signing certificate from the certification path. Then import it to the *machine's* **Trusted Publishers** store on managed devices. You can use the process in the following blog, but make sure to export the *code signing certificate* from the certification path: [Adding a Certificate to Trusted Publishers using Intune](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/intune-customer-success/adding-a-certificate-to-trusted-publishers-using-intune/ba-p/1974488).
<!-- 13250530 -->
- After updating to Configuration Manager current branch, version 2111, the hman.log file contains errors resembling the following:
   ```text
   Failed to read certificate context from file 'readme.txt', 0x8009310b
   Failed to process TPM certs cab, 0x8009310b
   ```
   This error doesn't affect normal site operations but can hinder other troubleshooting efforts.
<!-- 13323720 -->
- The **Run summarization task** for a software update deployment fails to run on the central administration site (CAS). The statesys.log contains an error resembling the following:
   ```text
   *** exec spProcessSingleSummarizationRequests
   *** [42000][2812][Microsoft][SQL Server Native Client 11.0][SQL Server]Could not find stored procedure 'spTask_SUM_AssignmentComplianceEvaluator'. : spProcessSingleSummarizationRequests
   ```
