   KB [15152495](../../hotfix/2207/15152495.md): Update rollup for Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager current branch, version 2207

## Issues that are fixed
<!-- 13879970 -->
- The OSDInjection.xml file is now preserved during an update to a new Configuration Manager version. If an administrator has modified the file those changes will be kept after the update process.

<!-- 14129129 -->>
- The default file size for Configuration Manager client logs is increased to 2.5 MB when a pull distribution point (pull DP) is installed. This will help troubleshooting potential issues with the pull DP.

<!-- 14189926 -->
- Content transfer to a pull DP may be stuck in an "In-progress" state after 50 different packages are transferred in a short period of time. For example, the issue can happen after installing a new pull DP.

<!-- 14476554 -->
- The *Create Script* wizard now supports the **List** parameter type. For example, the following input is now supported.
   ```text
   [array]arrays=@('3', 'b', 'c','d')
   or
   [string[]]arrays=@(​′​3​′​​,​′​​b​′​​,​′​​c​′​​,​′​​d​′​​)
   ```

<!-- 14839263 -->
- The *Verbose Logs* registry key is now properly configured for the SMS_AD_FOREST_DISCOVERY_MANAGER component.

<!-- 14852858 -->
- Co-managed devices aren't merged as expected in the admin center.

<!-- 14897684 -->
- The client signing certificate is recreated and a discovery data record (DDR) is sent when a client runs a non-operating system deployment task sequence. In large environments, this can lead to a backlog of .RDR files.

<!-- 15082072 -->
- A horizontal side scroll is now displayed when the data in a fixed-width window exceeds the available display space. For example, you can now scroll to show an entire OU name in *Criterion Properties*, in the *Membership Rules* section of the *Create Device Collection Wizard*.

<!-- 15783171 -->
- Collection evaluation fails if the query contains the string "Client0", such as "PRI**Client0**7.01.0" for example. When the evaluation fails, an error similar to the following is recorded in the colleval.log file.
   ```text
   The select list for the INSERT statement contains fewer items than the insert list. The number of SELECT values must match the number of INSERT columns.
   Error evaluating collection rules [PRI0001A, Error 0x15]
   ```

<!-- 16260986 -->
- Windows product lifecycle data is updated in the Configuration Manager console.
