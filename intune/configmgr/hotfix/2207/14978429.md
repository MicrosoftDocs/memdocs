## Update information for Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager
The following hotfix to resolve this problem is available for download from the Microsoft Download Center:

[Download this hotfix now](https://download.microsoft.com/download/8/e/d/8ed826e2-0a9d-4160-a1a0-725efa0d0971/1.5.5.14088/DoincInstall.exe).

After you download this hotfix, refer to the following installation instructions.

## Installation instructions
1. Confirm there is not currently an installation of the MCC component in progress. This is done by checking for status message **9522**, generated by the `SMS_DISTRIBUTION_MANAGER` component. The 9522 message indicates that installation is no longer being retried.
2. Copy the new version of `DoincInstall.exe`, version **1.5.5.14088**, to the `{SMSInstallDir}\bin\x64` folder on all site servers, including the Central Administration Site (CAS) if present, and any passive sites.
3. Uncheck the **Enable this distribution point to be used as Microsoft Connected Cache server** option in the affected distribution pointâ€™s properties.
4. Wait for the uninstall of MCC to complete on the distribution point. This can be confirmed by looking for a **9152** success status message, combined with the following entry in `distmgr.log`.
   ```text
   Finished waiting for DoincInstall. InvocationState: UninstallCompleted. InvocationExitCode: 0. InvocationMessage:.
   ```
5. Recheck the **Enable this distribution point to be used as Microsoft Connected Cache server** option for the affected distribution point.

   > [!TIP]
   > For sites with a large number of distribution points, replace steps 3 - 5 above with the following.
   > - Create an empty file named `resetdps.trn` and place it in the `{SMSInstallDir}\inboxes\distmgr.box` folder. This will reinstall all distribution points for that site using the latest version of `DoincInstall.exe` copied in step 2. above.
