## Hotfixes that are included in this update

- KB [12709700](../../hotfix/2111/12709700.md) Update for Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager version 2111
- KB [12959506](../../hotfix/2111/12959506.md) Client update for Configuration Manager current branch, version 2111

## Update information for Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager current branch, version 2111

This update is available in the Updates and Servicing node of the Configuration Manager console for environments that were installed by using early update ring or globally available builds of version 2111.

Members of the Configuration Manager Technology Adoption Program (TAP) must first apply the private TAP rollup before this update is displayed.

To verify which build is in use, look for a Package GUID by adding the Package GUID column to the details pane of the Updates and Servicing node in the console. The update applies to installations from packages that have the following GUIDs:

- **653BACCA-5BCE-4B4C-9A83-10932A561F71**
- **B07144F6-3B8E-4587-B1F0-BB47DA54C566**
- **C77888E5-7499-4885-9EED-811BB2D958C0**
- **44CE0720-6C46-4554-89CF-C9713E9C06C6**


The update is also applicable to TAP builds with the private TAP rollup (**C30077BF-D610-4C8A-BDB1-9B2D5442380E**) installed.
New installations from 2111 media, as opposed to updates from prior versions, will not have any package GUIDs listed.

### Restart information

This update doesn't require a computer restart but will initiate a [site reset](../../core/servers/manage/modify-your-infrastructure.md#bkmk_reset) after installation.

### Additional installation information

After you install this update on a primary site, pre-existing secondary sites must be manually updated. To update a secondary site in the Configuration Manager console, select **Administration** > **Site Configuration** > **Sites** >  **Recover Secondary Site**, and then select the secondary site. The primary site then reinstalls that secondary site by using the updated files. Configurations and settings for the secondary site aren't affected by this reinstallation. The new, upgraded, and reinstalled secondary sites under that primary site automatically receive this update.

Run the following SQL Server command on the site database to check whether the update version of a secondary site matches that of its parent primary site:
   ```code
   select dbo.fnGetSecondarySiteCMUpdateStatus ('SiteCode_of_secondary_site')
   ```
If the value 1 is returned, the site is up to date, with all the hotfixes applied on its parent primary site.

If the value 0 is returned, the site has not installed all the fixes that are applied to the primary site, and you should use the **Recover Secondary Site** option to update the secondary site.

The following major components are updated to the versions specified:

| Component | Version |
|---|---|
