### Update information for Microsoft Configuration Manager current branch, versions 2403, 2409, 2503

This update is available in the Updates and Servicing node of the Configuration Manager console for environments with the following update applied.

- 2403: [KB28204160: Update rollup for Microsoft Configuration Manager version 2403](../2403/28204160.md)
- 2409: [KB30385346: Update rollup for Microsoft Configuration Manager version 2409](../2409/30385346.md)
- 2503: [KB32480179: Update for Microsoft Configuration Manager version 2503, early update ring](../2503/32480179.md)

### Restart information

This update doesn't require a computer restart, but does require a [site reset](../../core/servers/manage/modify-your-infrastructure.md#bkmk_reset) after installation.

### Additional installation information

After you install this update on a primary site, preexisting secondary sites must be manually updated. To update a secondary site in the Configuration Manager console, select **Administration** > **Site Configuration** > **Sites** >  **Recover Secondary Site**, and then select the secondary site. The primary site then reinstalls that secondary site by using the updated files. This reinstallation doesn't affect configurations and settings for the secondary site. The new, upgraded, and reinstalled secondary sites under that primary site automatically receive this update.

Run the following SQL Server command on the site database to check whether the update version of a secondary site matches that of its parent primary site:
   ```sql
   select dbo.fnGetSecondarySiteCMUpdateStatus ('SiteCode_of_secondary_site')
   ```
If the value 1 is returned, the site is up to date, with all the hotfixes applied on its parent primary site.

If the value 0 is returned, all the fixes that are applied to the primary site aren't installed for the secondary site. You should use the **Recover Secondary Site** option to update the secondary site.
