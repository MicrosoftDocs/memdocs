# Console terminates unexpectedly in Configuration Manager current branch, version 2010

*Applies to: Configuration Manager (current branch, version 2010)*

This article was previously published as KB4599924.

In Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager current branch, version 2010, the Configuration Manager console checks for communication with the SMS Provider every hour. If the SMS Provider is unreachable at the time the check occurs, the console will terminate with the following message displayed.
   ```text
   Microsoft.ConfigurationManager has stopped working.
   A problem caused the program to stop working correctly.
   Windows will close the program and notify you if a solution is available.
   ```

A .NET Runtime Event ID 1026 will be recorded in the application event log with details resembling either of the following.
   ```text
   Exception Info: Microsoft.ConfigurationManagement.ManagementProvider.WqlQueryEngine.WqlQueryException
   Exception Info: Microsoft.ConfigurationManagement.ManagementProvider.SmsConnectionException
   ```

It's possible for this scenario to occur when installing a Configuration Manager update or update rollup.
Restarting the console prior to installing an update resets the one-hour time and reduces the chance of this exception occurring.
