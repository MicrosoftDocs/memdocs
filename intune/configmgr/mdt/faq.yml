    questions:
      - question: |
          What's the MDT support life cycle?
        answer: |
          For more information, see [Microsoft Deployment Toolkit support life cycle](/troubleshoot/windows-server/deployment/deployment-toolkit-support).

      - question: |
          Is this release only supported with version 'X' of Windows client, Windows ADK, or Configuration Manager?
        answer: |
          We primarily tested this build of MDT with the configuration listed in the [supported platforms list](release-notes.md#supported-platforms). Unless there are any explicit [known issues](known-issues.md), anything outside of the above configuration has a high probability of still working. Your mileage may vary as we haven't explicitly tested other combinations.

      - question: |
          How do I get help with MDT?
        answer: |
          Use one of the following methods to get help with MDT (in prioritized order):

          1. Post to the [MDT forum](/answers/topics/mem-mdt.html). MVPs and others in the community watch and respond to posts there. This method is probably the most efficient way to get help.  

          2. Contact Microsoft Support. Open a support case and get some professional help.  

          3. If you can consistently reproduce an issue and think it's a product bug, file it in the Windows 10 [Feedback Hub](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4021566/windows-10-send-feedback-to-microsoft-with-feedback-hub-app). The product team investigates everything that's reported. When filing feedback, use the **Enterprise Management** category and **OS Deployment** subcategory. This categorization helps classify and route your feedback to the MDT team.
