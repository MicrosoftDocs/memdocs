# Application installation common error codes reference

Applications can be installed on clients by creating deployments from the Configuration Manager console or by [targeting applications to tenant attached devices](./applications.md) from the [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431). Use the information in this article to assist with troubleshooting application installation errors. <!--8364465-->

## <a name="bkmk_general"></a> General troubleshooting tips

Generally, if an application installs successfully on a device with the given command line in the system context, it will install successfully through Configuration Manager and from the Microsoft Intune admin center. You can simulate this by using [PSExec](/sysinternals/downloads/psexec).

1. Open an administrative command prompt.
1. Change directory to where you saved [PSExec](/sysinternals/downloads/psexec).
1. Type in `psexec -accepteula -s -i cmd`.
1. This opens a new command prompt window running interactively in the system context. Check that you're in the system context by running a `whoami` command.
1. Run the install from the new windows with the installation command line. For example, `msiexec /i "My App.msi" /q` would be a quiet install of the "My App" msi file.

You may also find that searching through multiple files for a specific string is useful. For instance, you might want to search all the client `.mof` files for a specific class, or you might want to search logs for a specific ID. Using a specific ID when searching can give you an understanding of how components are related to each other. Use the [select-string cmdlet](/powershell/module/Microsoft.PowerShell.Utility/Select-String) in those instances.

```powershell
select-string -Path "c:\windows\ccm\*.mof" -Pattern 'CacheInfoEx'
select-string -Path "c:\windows\ccm\logs\*.log" -Pattern 'CacheInfoEx.CacheId="ccfe8120-4b9b-4f6e-b8fb-f8c1b1fd74d8'
```

### <a name="bkmk_general-msi"></a> General MSI troubleshooting tips

When errors are encountered from MSI, typically you'll need to [Enable Windows Installer logging](/troubleshoot/windows-client/application-management/enable-windows-installer-logging). After the logging is enabled, you can retry the problem installation and Windows Installer will track the progress and post it to the `%temp%` folder. The new log's file name is random. However, the first letters are `Msi` and the file name has a .log extension.

The  [MsiExec.exe and InstMsi.exe Error Messages](/windows/win32/msi/error-codes) and [Windows Installer Action Return Values](/windows/win32/msi/logging-of-action-return-values) lists are useful when reviewing a Windows Installer log as are the [general troubleshooting tips](#bkmk_general).

### <a name="bkmk_general-windows"></a> General Windows troubleshooting tips

Use the [Windows system error codes](/windows/win32/debug/system-error-codes--0-499-) list or [Download the Microsoft Error Lookup Tool](/windows/win32/debug/system-error-code-lookup-tool) for looking up additional codes that aren't listed in this article. Using the Windows event logs and the [general troubleshooting tips](#bkmk_general) can also help identify the cause of these errors.

### 1

**Message**: Incorrect function

**Additional information for error resolution**: Review the Windows event logs around the time of the failure in combination with the installation logs to determine the possible cause of the error.

### 2

**Message**: The system cannot find the file specified

**Additional information for error resolution**:
- If the missing file is a system file, run the [System File Checker tool to repair missing or corrupted system files](https://support.microsoft.com/help/929833/use-the-system-file-checker-tool-to-repair-missing-or-corrupted-system). You can also use `/scanfile=file` or `/verifyfile` with the [sfc command](/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/sfc) to scan the binary and check if there is any issue with that file.
- If the missing file is an application file, you can repair or uninstall and reinstall the application to replace the missing file.
- If you're unsure which file is missing and the logs aren't listing it, you may want to use [Process Monitor](/sysinternals/downloads/procmon) to help identify the problematic file.
   - You can launch Process Monitor without capturing events and filters by using `ProcMon.exe /NoConnect /NoFilter /AcceptEULA`

### 692

**Message**: Debugger terminated process

**Additional information for error resolution**: Detach any debuggers attached to the process and retry the application installation.

### 0x80000003

**Message**: One or more arguments are invalid

**Additional information for error resolution**: Review the Windows event logs around the time of the failure in combination with the installation logs to determine the possible cause of the error.

### 0x80000007L

**Message**: Operation aborted

**Additional information for error resolution**: Use the installation logs and Configuration Manager application logs to determine why installation stopped. Merge the logs so you can easily review what happened before the 0x80000007L error. Use `eventvwr.msc` to review the Windows event logs for additional events that occurred around the time of the installation failure.

### 0x80000009

**Message**: General access denied error

**Additional information for error resolution**: If the issue isn't clear from the logs, using `eventvwr.msc` to review Windows event logs and [Process Monitor](/sysinternals/downloads/procmon) can help identify problematic files or processes. If needed, use the Windows user interface or [icacls](/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/icacls) to modify permissions on the problematic file.

Additional tips for file permissions in Windows operating systems:
- Deny permissions always take precedence over Allow permissions.
- Explicit permissions take precedence over inherited permissions.
- If NTFS permissions conflict, or example, if group and user permissions are contradictory, the most liberal permissions take precedence.
- Permissions are cumulative.

### 0x80004005

**Message**: Unspecified error

**Additional information for error resolution**: Use the installation logs and Configuration Manager application logs to determine why installation stopped. Merge the logs so you can easily review what happened before the 0x80004005 error. Use `eventvwr.msc` to review the Windows event logs for additional events that occurred around the time of the installation failure. Follow the [application troubleshooting guide](../apps/understand/app-deployment-technical-reference.md) to help resolve the error.
[Process Monitor](/sysinternals/downloads/procmon) can also help identify the failure.

<!--note-->
### 0x8000FFFF

**Message**: Catastrophic failure

**Additional information for error resolution**: Review the Windows event logs around the time of the failure in combination with the installation logs to determine the possible cause of the error.

### 0x80040154

**Message**: Class not registered

**Additional information for error resolution**: This is typically a configuration-related DCOM error. Review DCOM configuration settings using [dcomconfig](/windows/win32/com/enabling-com-security-using-dcomcnfg). If there's a problematic .dll file, you can use [regsvr32](/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/regsvr32) to register the dll file and try the install again. A large number of problematic files could be a sign of an underlying issue that needs to be resolved before you can install the application.

### 0x80091007

**Message**: The hash value is not correct

**Additional information for error resolution**: The hash of a file isn't correct and the installation can't complete. Typically you will see this error in the **CAS.log**. Check to see if file contents for the application were recently updated. There may be an issue with the package, in some cases you may need to rebuild and redistribute it. This issue can also happen if there is a sharing violation on a file, such as a security application scanning the file. Configuration Manager expects exclusive access to the file during a hash check. You can identify the problematic process by running a [Process Monitor](/sysinternals/downloads/procmon) and adding a filter. The condition to be met is if the **Result** *contains* **Sharing Violation** then **Include** the event.

### 0xC0000142

**Message**: Initialization of the dynamic link library failed. The process is terminating abnormally

**Additional information for error resolution**: If there is a problematic .dll file, you can use [regsvr32](/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/regsvr32) to register the dll file and try again. A large number of problematic files could be a sign of an underlying issue that needs to be resolved before you can install the application.

## <a name="bkmk_wmi"></a> Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) errors

|Error code|Error source|Error message|
|----|----|----|
|[0x80041001](#0x80041001)|Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI)|WBEM_E_FAILED|
|[0x80041009](#0x80041009)|Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI)|WBEM_E_NOT_AVAILABLE|
|[0x8004100E](#0x8004100e)|Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI)|WBEM_E_INVALID_NAMESPACE|

### <a name="bkmk_general-wmi"></a> General WMI troubleshooting tips

Problematic namespaces can typically be found in the [Configuration Manager log files](../core/plan-design/hierarchy/log-files.md) and the [WMI logging](/windows/win32/wmisdk/wmi-log-files). WMI relies on Component Object Model (COM)/Distributed Component Object Model (DCOM), the registry, the file system, and Remote Procedure Call (RPC). DCOM registrations and permissions are critical for WMI operations to be successful. You can review DCOM configuration settings using [dcomconfig](/windows/win32/com/enabling-com-security-using-dcomcnfg).

When troubleshooting WMI problems, typically you start by verifying that the needed namespaces, classes, and instances exists in the WMI repository and can be accessed.

Verify the namespace exists on the target first by running `wmimgmt.msc` from an elevated command prompt. When WMI Control launches:
1. Select **Action** then **Properties**.
1. Select the **Security** tab to see all the namespaces.
1. Navigate to the namespace in question.
1. Verify the namespace exists and review the security on the namespace.

To connect  WMI Control to another computer:
1.  Select **Action** then  **Connect to another computer**.
1. Select the option for **Another computer:** then supply the name.
1. Select **Properties** to connect. The connection to the WMI repository on the remote computer doesn't occur until you select **Properties**.
1. Verify the namespace exists and review the security on the namespace.
1. You may also wish to try to connect with the IP address too to verify that you can connect.

Verify the namespace exists on the target and that you can query it properly. Run the Windows Management Instrument Tester from an elevated command prompt by typing in `wbemtest`. When the Windows Management Instrument Tester launches:
1. Select **Connect...**
2. Type in the problematic namespace such as `root\cimv2` or  `root\ccm` and user credentials if needed. To connect to another machine, supply the name or the IP address such as `\\Machine1\root\ccm` and credentials if needed.
1. Select **Enum Classes...** to verify you get classes listed for the problematic namespace.
1. Set the superclass info to **Recursive** and select **OK** to verify classes list for the problematic namespace.
1. Launch the object editor for one of the classes by double-clicking on it.
   - If you're using the `root\ccm` namespace, select a class that starts with "CCM_" such as CCM_ClientIdentificationInformation.
   - If you're using `root\cimv2`, choose one that starts with "Win32_" such as Win32_BIOS.
1. Select **Instances** to verify the instances of the selected class load. For some classes, it's ok if there aren't any instances, just make sure that the **Query Result** window states **Done**. Long running queries to list of instances or queries that never finish may indicate a problem.


Verify the repository:
1. From an elevated command prompt, run `winmgmt /verifyrepository`. Verifying is typically useful for invalid class errors especially if you had to recently recompile a .mof file using [mofcomp](/windows/win32/wmisdk/mofcomp).
1. If problems are found during verification, you can try to salvage using `winmgmt /salvagerepository`
1. Typically, you won't use /resetrepository unless it's truly needed an no other alternative exists. Some namespaces won't automatically rebuild and you'll need to either reinstall the software associated with the missing namespace or mofcomp the application's .mof files to rebuild them.

### 0x80041001

**Message**: WBEM_E_FAILED

**Additional information for error resolution**: WBEM_E_FAILED is a generic WMI failure error. The error can be caused by a number of things. The error will sometimes tell you which method or instance failed. You'll probably also see related log entires around the same time if you merge logs together based on similar function. For instance, if you see the error related to content for an application, you may want to merge together CAS.log, ContentTransferManager.log and DataTransfer.log. If the error happened on a site server not a client, you may want to review SMSProv.log for additional information. Use the [General WMI troubleshooting tips](#bkmk_general-wmi) to help identify the issue along with the application installation logs.
