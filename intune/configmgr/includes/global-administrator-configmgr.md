<!-- This include file is used in ConfigMan articles that mention Global Admin. -->

The [Microsoft Entra Global Administrator](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/privileged-roles-permissions) role is a highly privileged role and should only be used when another role can't be used. This feature requires the Global Administrator role. For other features, Microsoft recommends using roles with the fewest permissions. To learn more, see [Fundamentals of role-based administration for Configuration Manager](../core/understand/fundamentals-of-role-based-administration.md).
