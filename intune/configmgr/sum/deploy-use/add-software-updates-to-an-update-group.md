# Add software updates to an update group

*Applies to: Configuration Manager (current branch)*

 Software update groups provide you with an effective method to organize software updates in your environment. You can manually add software updates to a software update group or automatically add software updates to a software update group by using an ADR. You can also deploy a software update group manually or deploy the group automatically by using an ADR. After you deploy a software update group, you can add new software updates to the group and Configuration Manager will automatically deploy them. Use the following procedures to add software updates to a new or existing software update group.

> [!TIP]
> - Starting in version 2203, you can organize software update groups and packages by using folders. This change allows for better categorization and management of software updates. For more information, see [Deploy software updates](deploy-software-updates.md#bkmk_folder).<!-- 3601129 -->
> - Devices running an unsupported operating systems will display as compliant since there aren't applicable updates to the operating system any longer. <!--13952160-->
