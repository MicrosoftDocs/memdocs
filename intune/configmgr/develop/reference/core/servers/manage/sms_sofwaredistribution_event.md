# SMS_SofwareDistribution_Event
The `SMS_SofwareDistribution_Event` class is the base class for all software-distribution advertisement status-message classes, in Configuration Manager. All advertisement status messages have the insertion strings of this class. Also, each derived class must set the properties of its base `SMS_SofwareDistribution_Event` class.

> [!NOTE]
>  The misspelling of software in `SMS_SofwareDistribution_Event` in this documentation is intentional as the implementation of the class is misspelled.
