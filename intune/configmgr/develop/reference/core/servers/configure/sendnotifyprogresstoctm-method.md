# SendNotifyProgressToCTM Method
The **SendNotifyProgressToCTM** method notifies Content Transfer Manager of the progress of a job.

## Syntax

```
HRESULT stdcall SendNotifyProgressToCTM(
    LPCWSTR szProgressType,
    LPCWSTR szEndpoint,
    LPCWSTR szID,
    LPCWSTR szClientData,
    LPCWSTR szBytesTotal,
    LPCWSTR szBytesTransferred,
    ULONG ulFilesTotal,
    ULONG ulFilesTransferred
);

```

#### Parameters
 `szProgressType`
 Data type: LPCWSTR

 Qualifiers: [in]

 Either one of the S_DTS_* constants for status changes or NULL/empty string for a bytes progress only.

 `szEndpoint`
 Data type: LPCWSTR

 Qualifiers: [in]

 The notification endpoint. This was passed into the call to **ICcmAlternateDownloadProvider::DownloadContent** (szNotifyEndpoint).

 `szID`
 Data type: UInt32

 Qualifiers: [in]

 The job to which the notification corresponds. This is the GUID originally returned by **ICcmAlternateDownloadProvider::DownloadContent**.

 `szClientData`
 Data type: LPCWSTR

 Qualifiers: [in]

 The client-specific data that was passed into the call to **ICcmAlternateDownloadProvider::DownloadContent** (szNotifyData).

 `szBytesTotal`
 Data type: LPCWSTR

 Qualifiers: [in]

 The total number of bytes in the job.

 `szBytesTransferred`
 Data type: LPCWSTR

 Qualifiers: [in]

 The number of bytes transferred so far.

 `ulFilesTotal`
 Data type: ULONG

 Qualifiers: [in]

 The total number of files in the job.

 `ulFilesTransferred`
 Data type: ULONG

 Qualifiers: [in]

 The number of files transferred so far.

## Remarks
 If the totals aren't yet known, pass 0 for the values. Once the provider has determined the total byte and file count, those values should be used.

## Return Values
 An `HRESULT` code. Possible values include, but aren't limited to, the following one:

 S_OK
 Success implies that discovery was triggered successfully. All other return values indicate failure.
