# AddBoundary Method in Class SMS_BoundaryGroup
The `AddBoundary` Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) class method, in Configuration Manager, adds boundaries to this boundary group.

```
SInt32 AddBoundary(
   UInt32 BoundaryID[]
);
```

#### Parameters
 `BoundaryID`
 Data type: `UInt32` Array

 Qualifiers: [in]

 Unique identifier of the boundary.

## Return Values
 An `SInt32` data type that is 0 to indicate success or non-zero to indicate failure.
