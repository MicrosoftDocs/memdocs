# SMS_ClientCommunicationConfig Server WMI Class
The `SMS_ClientCommunicationConfig` Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) class is an SMS Provider server class, in Configuration Manager, that controls how Windows 8 client computers communicate with Configuration Manager sites when they use metered Internet connections.

 The following syntax is simplified from Managed Object Format (MOF) code and includes all inherited properties.

## Syntax

```
Class SMS_ClientCommunicationConfig : SMS_ClientAgentConfig_BaseClass
{
    UInt32 AgentID;
    UInt32 MeteredNetworkUsage;
};
```

## Methods
 The `SMS_ClientCommunicationConfig` class doesn't define any methods.

## Properties
 `MeteredNetworkUsage`
 Data type: `UInt32`

 Access type: Read/Write

 Qualifiers: none

 Set metered network usage behavior. Possible values are:

|Value|Metered network usage policy|
|-|-|
|1|Allow metered network use.|
|2|Only use the metered network for deployments that are marked to allow use of the metered network. This means meta-data such as policy will always use the metered network. And based on the policy, the client decides whether or not to use the metered network for the deployment.|
|4|Block metered network usage.|
