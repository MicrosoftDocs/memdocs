# Hardware inventory server WMI classes

The Configuration Manager hardware inventory server WMI classes are generated dynamically.

During the Configuration Manager hardware inventory process, the name for a class is transformed from "Win32_hardware" to "SMS_G_System_hardware". For example, "Win32_DiskDrive" translates to "SMS_G_System_DISK".

In addition to the class name change, the following differences are found between the Win32 classes and the Configuration Manager hardware inventory server classes:

- Each Configuration Manager class inherits four properties from [SMS_G_System_Current Server WMI Class](../../../../../develop/reference/core/clients/manage/sms_g_system_current-server-wmi-class.md).

- The Configuration Manager hardware inventory classes don't support the Win32 class methods.

- Many of the Configuration Manager hardware inventory classes contain a subset of the Win32 class properties.
