# CreateRelationship method in class SMS_UserMachineRelationship

The `CreateRelationship` WMI class method creates a relationship between a user and a device.

The following syntax is simplified from Managed Object Format (MOF) code and defines the method.

## Syntax

```
sint32 CreateRelationship (
     uint32 MachineResourceId,
     string UserAccountName,
     uint32 SourceId,
     uint32 TypeId
);
```

## Parameters

 `MachineResourceId`
 Data type: `UInt32`

 Qualifiers: `[in]`

 Unique Configuration Manager-supplied identifier for the resource.

 `UserAccountName`
 Data type: `String`

 Qualifiers: `[in]`

 User account name. For example, `contoso\jqpublic`.

 `SourceId`
 Data type: `UInt32`

 Qualifiers: `[in]`

 Source object identifier for dependency.

|Value|Name|Description|
|-|-|-|
|`1`|Self-service portal|The end user enabled the relationship by selecting the option in Software Center.|
|`2`|Administrator|An administrator created the relationship manually in the console.|
|`3`|User|Unused/deprecated.|
|`4`|Usage agent|The threshold of activity triggered a relationship to be created.|
|`5`|Device management|The user and device were tied together during on-prem MDM enrollment.|
|`6`|OSD|The user and device were tied together as part of an OS deployment task sequence.|
|`7`|Fast install|The user/device were tied together temporarily to enable an on-demand install from the catalog if no UDA relationship installed before the Install was triggered.|
|`8`|Exchange Server connector|The device was provisioned through Exchange ActiveSync.|

 `TypeId`
 Data type: `UInt32`

 Qualifiers: `[in, optional]`

An array of types for this relationship. For a value of `1`, the **UniqueUserName** is the primary user. If the value is null, they aren't the primary user.

## Return values

 An  `SInt32` data type that is 0 to indicate success or non-zero to indicate failure.
