# GetPolicyState Method in Class CCM_SoftwareCatalogUtilities
The `GetPolicyState` Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) class method in Configuration Manager that returns the state of a policy object.

 The following syntax is simplified from Managed Object Format (MOF) code and defines the method.

## Syntax

```
uint32 GetPolicyState
{
    [IN]    String Id
    [OUT]   UInt32 Status
    [OUT]   UInt32 State
};
```

## Parameters
 `Id`
 Data type: `String`

 Qualifiers: [id("0"), in]

 Unique ID of the policy object.

 `Status`
 Data type: `UInt32`

 Qualifiers: [id("1"), out]

 Current status.

 `State`
 Data type: `UInt32`

 Qualifiers: [id("2"), out]

 Current state of the policy object. Possible values are:

|Value|State|
|-|-|
|NULL|The policy object is inactive and hasn't been downloaded. This value is the default value.|
|DownloadPending|The evaluator determines that the policy object needs to be applied and should be downloaded. This state is a temporary one used during the evaluation process.|
|DownloadStarted|The policy object has been requested from the management point and is in the process of being downloaded.|
|DownloadComplete|The policy object finished downloading from the management point but hasn't been compiled into WMI yet.|
|Inactive|The policy object is downloaded and compiled, but has no active assignments.|
|Applied|The policy object is currently active, but pending revaluation. This state is a temporary one used during the evaluation process. If the evaluation determines that the policy object should no longer be active, its actions must be revoked.|
|ApplyPending|The policy object is currently inactive, but now has active assignments and actions that should be applied. This state is a temporary one used during the evaluation process.|
|Active|The policy object is currently active and has been applied.|
|NotApplicable|The policy object isn't applicable. <br /><br /> This information applies to System Center 2012 Configuration Manager SP1 or later, and System Center 2012 R2 Configuration Manager or later.|
