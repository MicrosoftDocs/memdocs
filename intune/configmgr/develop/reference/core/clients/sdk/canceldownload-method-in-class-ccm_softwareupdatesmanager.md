# CancelDownload Method in Class CCM_SoftwareUpdatesManager
The `CancelDownload` WMI class method, in Configuration Manager, cancels an in-progress download of software updates during a deployment.

 The following syntax is simplified from Managed Object Format (MOF) code and defines the method.

## Syntax

```
UInt32 CancelDownload();
```

#### Parameters
 None.

## Return Values
 A `UInt32` data type that is 0 to indicate success or nonzero to indicate failure.

 For information about handling returned errors, see [About Configuration Manager Errors](../../../../../develop/core/understand/about-configuration-manager-errors.md).

## Remarks
 The `CancelDownload` method cancels the download only for deployments that are initiated by the Software Updates Client Agent or through the Configuration Manager SDK. If the software updates deployment was initiated as the result of a deadline, the call to this method fails.

## Requirements

## Runtime Requirements
