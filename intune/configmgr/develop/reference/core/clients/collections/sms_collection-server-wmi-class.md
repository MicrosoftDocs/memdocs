# SMS_Collection server WMI class

The `SMS_Collection` WMI class is an SMS Provider server class in Configuration Manager. It represents a collection of resources related logically by rules along with collection information.

The following syntax is simplified from Managed Object Format (MOF) code and includes all inherited properties.

## Syntax

```MOF
Class SMS_Collection : SMS_BaseClass
{
   String CollectionID;
   SMS_CollectionRule CollectionRules[];
   UInt32 CollectionType;
   SInt32 CollectionVariablesCount;
   String Comment;
   UInt32 CurrentStatus;
   Uint32 FullEvaluationRunTime;
   Uint32 FullEvaluationMemberChanges;
   DateTime FullEvaluationMemberChangeTime;
   DateTime FullEvaluationLastRefreshTime;

   SMS_ScheduleToken RefreshSchedule[];
   UInt32 RefreshType;
   Boolean ReplicateToSubSites;
   SInt32 ServiceWindowsCount;

[SMS_ScheduleToken server WMI class](../../servers/configure/sms_scheduletoken-server-wmi-class.md) objects indicating an update or refresh schedule for the collection. The site only updates collection membership if your application specifies a schedule or calls the [RequestRefresh method](requestrefresh-method-in-class-sms_collection.md) in the **SMS_Collection** class. For the collection evaluator to use the schedule, set the `RefreshType` property to periodic (`2`).

### `RefreshType`

Data type: `UInt32`

| `1` | Manual |
| `2` | Periodic |
| `4` | Constant update |

To base the refresh on the schedule specified in `RefreshSchedule`, set this property to periodic (`2`). If you set this property to manual (`1`), manually update the collection with the [RequestRefresh method](requestrefresh-method-in-class-sms_collection.md).

### `ReplicateToSubSites`

## Remarks

Class qualifiers for this class include:

- Secured

For more information about both the class qualifiers and the property qualifiers included in the properties section, see [Configuration Manager class and property qualifiers](../../../misc/class-and-property-qualifiers.md).

Collection information represented by this class includes the refresh schedule and the members, represented by [SMS_CM_RES_COLL_CollectionID server WMI class](sms_cm_res_coll_collectionid-server-wmi-class.md) objects. Your application can use a collection to target resources for software distribution.

When you run a query against a dynamic collection represented by `SMS_Collection`, make sure that the SMS Provider is loaded or that another method or query has already run.

The application should use the `SMS_Collection` methods to add, update, or delete membership rules defined by the `CollectionRules` property. This property isn't retrieved when your application enumerates `SMS_Collection`. To obtain the collection rules for a collection, your application must use `IWbemServices::GetObject` or `SWbemServices::Get`. For more information, see [Configuration Manager context qualifiers](../../../../core/understand/context-qualifiers.md).
