# GetDependent method in class SMS_Collection

Starting in version 2010, the `GetDependent` WMI class method in Configuration Manager gets the collection relationship info which depends on the input collection.

The following syntax is simplified from Managed Object Format (MOF) code and defines the method.

sint32 GetDependent(
    string Relationship[]
);
```

## Parameters

### `Relationship`

Data type: `String[]` (array)

Qualifiers: [out]

JSON string array of collection dependency relationship.

## Return values

An `SInt32` data type that is `0` to indicate success, or non-zero to indicate failure.

For more information about handling returned errors, see [About Configuration Manager errors](../../../../core/understand/about-configuration-manager-errors.md).

## Requirements

### Runtime requirements
