# RequestMachinePolicy Method in Class SMS_Client
The `RequestMachinePolicy` method, in Configuration Manager, initiates a request for machine policy.

 The following syntax is simplified from Managed Object Format (MOF) code and defines the method.

## Syntax

```
UInt32 RequestMachinePolicy(
      UInt32 uFlags
);
```

#### Parameters
 `uFlags`
 Data type: `UInt32`

 Qualifiers: [in]

 Flags identifying the policy. Possible values are:

| Value | Description |
| ----- | ----------- |
|0|A machine policy retrieval cycle is initiated.|
|1|A machine policy validation cycle is initiated, and the server and client cyclical redundancy checks (CRCs) are compared to verify that the policies are in agreement. If the policies aren't in agreement, then a resynchronization is initiated.|

## Return Values
 A `UInt32` data type that is 0 to indicate success or non-zero to indicate failure.
