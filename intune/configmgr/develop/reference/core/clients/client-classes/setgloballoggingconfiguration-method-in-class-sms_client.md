# SetGlobalLoggingConfiguration Method in Class SMS_Client
The `SetGlobalLoggingConfiguration` method, in Configuration Manager, defines the global logging configuration for the client. This configuration represents either component-level logging or default logging if component-level logging isn't defined.

 The following syntax is simplified from Managed Object Format (MOF) code and defines the method.

## Syntax

```
UInt32 SetGlobalLoggingConfiguration(
     UInt32 LogLevel,
     UInt32 LogMaxSize,
     UInt32 LogMaxHistory,
     Boolean DebugLogging
);
```

#### Parameters
 `LogLevel`
 Data type: `UInt32`

 Qualifiers: [in]

 The level of detail that the log will capture. Possible values are shown below. The default value is 1.

| Value | Description |
| ----- | ----------- |
|0|Verbose logging|
|1|Normal logging|
|2|No logging|

 `LogMaxSize`
 Data type: `UInt32`

 Qualifiers: [in]

 The maximum size, in bytes, of a given log file.

 `LogMaxHistory`
 Data type: `UInt32`

 Qualifiers: [in]

 The number of incremented log files to accumulate before deleting. When this number has been reached, the creation of a new log file results in the deletion of the oldest existing log file.

 `DebugLogging`
 Data type: `Boolean`

 Qualifiers: [in]

 `true` if debug logging should be enabled. Debug logging is rarely used except for troubleshooting.

## Return Values
 A `UInt32` data type that is 0 to indicate success or non-zero to indicate failure.

## Remarks
 This method manipulates registry keys. These keys shouldn't be manipulated directly. However, for reference, these keys can be found at HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/Software/Microsoft/CCM/logging/@GLOBAL. Enabling debug logging with `DebugLogging` results in the creation of a new key: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/Software/Microsoft/CCM/logging/debuglogging.
