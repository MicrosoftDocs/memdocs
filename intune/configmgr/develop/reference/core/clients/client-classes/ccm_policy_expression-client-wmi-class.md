# CCM_Policy_Expression Client WMI Class
In Configuration Manager, the `CCM_Policy_Expression` class is a client Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) class that represents a policy expression that evaluates to either `true` or `false`.

 The following syntax is simplified from Managed Object Format (MOF) code and includes all inherited properties.

## Syntax

```
Class CCM_Policy_Expression : CCM_Policy_Config
{
      String ExpressionData;
      String ExpressionLanguage;
      Boolean ExpressionState;
      String ExpressionType;
};
```

## Methods
 The `CCM_Policy_Expression` class doesn't define any methods.

## Properties
 `ExpressionData`
 Data type: `String`

 Access type: Read/Write

 Qualifiers: [Not_Null:ToInstance]

 Data representing the expression to evaluate. The actual format is specific to the expression type. For more information, see `ExpressionType`.

 `ExpressionLanguage`
 Data type: `String`

 Access type: Read/Write

 Qualifiers: [Not_Null:ToInstance]

 The type of expression, which must map to an object that contains information about the handler responsible for evaluating this expression type.

 `ExpressionState`
 Data type: `Boolean`

 Access type: Read/Write

 Qualifiers: None

 Current state of the expression. This value indicates the result of the last expression evaluation, or `null` if the expression has never been evaluated.

 `ExpressionType`
 Data type: `String`

 Access type: Read/Write

 Qualifiers: [Not_Null:ToInstance]

 Type that determines how the expression is evaluated. Possible values are:


| Value | Description |
| ----- | ----------- |
|Once|The expression is evaluated only once.|
|Until-true|The expression continues to be reevaluated until evaluation returns `true`.|
|Continuous|The expression is always reevaluated.|
