# AppDetectState Enumeration
In Configuration Manager, the `AppDetectState` enumeration defines application installation states. This enumeration is used by the [IAppManagementHandler Interface](../../../../../develop/reference/core/clients/client-classes/iappmanagementhandler-interface.md).

## Syntax

```
typedef enum tagAppDetectState
{
    appDetectNotFound = 0,
    appDetectInstalled,
    appDetectFailed
}AppDetectState;

```

## Elements
 `appDetectNotFound`
 The application was not found.

 `appDetectInstalled`
 The application is installed.

 `appDetectFailed`
 Application detection failed.

## Remarks
 This enumeration is used by the [IAppManagementHandler Interface](../../../../../develop/reference/core/clients/client-classes/iappmanagementhandler-interface.md).
