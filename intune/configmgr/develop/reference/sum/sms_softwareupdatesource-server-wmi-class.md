# SMS_SoftwareUpdateSource Server WMI Class
The `SMS_SoftwareUpdateSource` Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) class is an SMS Provider server class, in Configuration Manager, that lists all software update sources available on the site, for use in synchronizing metadata during a deployment.  

 The following syntax is simplified from Managed Object Format (MOF) code and includes all inherited properties.  

## Syntax  

```  
Class SMS_SoftwareUpdateSource : SMS_BaseClass  
{  
      String ApplicabilityCondition;  
      DateTime DateCreated;  
      DateTime DateModified;  
      Boolean IsExpired;  
      String PublicKeys;  
      String ScanMethod;  
      String ScanMethodParameters;  
      String ScannerToolPkgID;  
      UInt32 ScanType;  
      UInt32 SourceContentType;  
      String SourceSite;  
      String UpdateSourceDescription;  
      UInt32 UpdateSourceID;  
      String UpdateSourceName;  
      String UpdateSourceUniqueID;  
      String UpdateSourceVersion;  
      String UpdateType;  
};  
```  

## Methods  
 The `SMS_SoftwareUpdateSource` class does not define any methods.  

> [!NOTE]
>  The `ResendObjectToAllSites Method in Class SMS_SoftwareUpdateSource` has been deprecated in Configuration Manager.

## Remarks  
 There are no special class qualifiers for this class. For more information about both the class qualifiers and the property qualifiers included in the Properties section, see [Configuration Manager Class and Property Qualifiers](../../../develop/reference/misc/class-and-property-qualifiers.md).  

 Your application uses this class to set or modify the source of a software update so that metadata is properly synchronized during update deployment. Currently, the supported sources for software updates are Windows Server Update Services (WSUS) and ITMU/Offline Catalog.  

 To use this class, the application creates an `SMS_SoftwareUpdateSource` object and sets the properties as required for the particular software update and the source.
