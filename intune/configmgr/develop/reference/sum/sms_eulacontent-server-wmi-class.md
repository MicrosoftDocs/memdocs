# SMS_EULAContent Server WMI Class
The `SMS_EULAContent` Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) class is an SMS Provider server class, in Configuration Manager, that provides information about optional configuration item content associated with Microsoft Software License Terms.  

 The following syntax is simplified from Managed Object Format (MOF) code and includes all inherited properties.  

## Syntax  

```  
Class SMS_EULAContent : SMS_BaseClass  
{  
    UInt32 EULAContentID;  
    String EULAContentUniqueID;  
    String EULAText;  
    String SourceSite;  
};  
```  

## Methods  
 The `SMS_EULAContent` class does not define any methods.  

## Properties  
 `EULAContentID`  
 Data type: `UInt32`  

 Access type: Read-only  

 Qualifiers: [key, read]  

 The unique ID of license terms content. This ID is unique only for the site.  

 `EULAContentUniqueID`  
 Data type: `String`  

 Access type: Read/Write  

 Qualifiers: [unique]  

 The unique ID of the license terms content. This ID is unique across sites.  

 `EULAText`  
 Data type: `String`  

 Access type: Read/Write  

 Qualifiers: [lazy]  

 Content of the license terms.  

 `SourceSite`  
 Data type: `String`  

 Access type: Read-only  

 Qualifiers: [read, SizeLimit("3")]  

 The site code of the site where the license terms originate. The code string can have a maximum of three characters. For more information, see the `UpdateSource_ID` property in [SMS_CIUpdateSources Server WMI Class](../../../develop/reference/sum/sms_ciupdatesources-server-wmi-class.md).  

## Remarks  
 Class qualifiers for this class include:  

- Secured  

  For more information about both the class qualifiers and the property qualifiers included in the Properties section, see [Configuration Manager Class and Property Qualifiers](../../../develop/reference/misc/class-and-property-qualifiers.md).  

  This class is applicable to all types of configuration items, not just software updates. For a discussion of configuration item types, see the `CIType_ID` property of [SMS_ConfigurationItemBaseClass Server WMI Class](../../../develop/reference/compliance/sms_configurationitembaseclass-server-wmi-class.md).  

  Your application should use this class only if the `EulaExists` property is set to `true` in the specified configuration item. This property is defined in the [SMS_ConfigurationItemBaseClass Server WMI Class](../../../develop/reference/compliance/sms_configurationitembaseclass-server-wmi-class.md).  

  To use this class, the application creates an `SMS_EULAContent` object and sets the properties as required for the software update.
