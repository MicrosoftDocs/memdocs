# SMS_UpdateDeploymentSummary Server WMI Class
The `SMS_UpdateDeploymentSummary` Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) class is an SMS Provider server class, in Configuration Manager, that represents a summary for a given software update in given software updates deployment.  

 The following syntax is simplified from Managed Object Format (MOF) code and includes all inherited properties.  

## Syntax  

```  
Class SMS_UpdateDeploymentSummary : SMS_BaseClass  
{  
      Boolean AssignmentEnabled;  
      UInt32 AssignmentID;  
      String AssignmentName;  
      String AssignmentUniqueID;  
      UInt32 CI_ID;  
      String CollectionID;  
      String CollectionName;  
      Boolean IncludeSubCollections;  
      UInt32 NumFailed;  
      UInt32 NumInstalled;  
      UInt32 NumMissing;  
      UInt32 NumNotApplicable;  
      UInt32 NumPresent;  
      UInt32 NumTotal;  
      UInt32 NumUnknown;  
      DateTime StartTime;  
};  
```
