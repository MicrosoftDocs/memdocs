# RefreshPkgSource Method in Class SMS_TaskSequencePackage
The `RefreshPkgSource` class method, in Configuration Manager, refreshes the package source at all distribution points when the package properties haven't changed.

> [!CAUTION]
>  This method supports the Configuration Manager infrastructure and renders your task sequence inoperable if it is called.

 The following syntax is simplified from Managed Object Format (MOF) code and defines the method.

## Syntax

```
SInt32 RefreshPkgSource();
```

#### Parameters
 None.

## Return Values
 An `SInt32` data type that is 0 to indicate success or nonzero to indicate failure.

 For information about handling returned errors, see [About Configuration Manager Errors](../../../develop/core/understand/about-configuration-manager-errors.md).

## Remarks
 Using this method is the only way to force an update of the source files, other than by creating a `RefreshSchedule` value for the package. For information about the `RefreshSchedule` property, see [SMS_PackageBaseclass Server WMI Class](../../../develop/reference/core/servers/configure/sms_packagebaseclass-server-wmi-class.md).
