# About Application Configuration Items
Application configuration items include all the functionality of general configuration items, but their identity can be detected independently of its settings and objects. Desired Configuration Management in Configuration Manager supports two methods for detecting the presence of an application configuration item: (1) Windows Installer package and (2) Script-based discovery. Configuration item (level) discoverability allows application configuration items to be referenced as prohibited or optional within the context of a configuration baseline.

 Examples of application configuration items might include:

-   Microsoft Office Professional 2003

-   Microsoft Word
