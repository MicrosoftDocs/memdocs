# About Configuration Manager Console Extension
The Configuration Manager console has an XML-based architecture that can be easily extended. The Configuration Manager console supports the following extensions:

## Actions
 An action is a task or command accessed through either a context menu or the ribbon. Many standard actions are available, and you can extend them to add new functionality, such as displaying a dialog box or launching an application.

## Forms
 You can extend the Configuration Manager console with dialog boxes or property sheets. You can also add new property pages to existing Configuration Manager console property sheets, such as the properties dialog for an object.

## Nodes
 You can add new nodes to the Configuration Manager console.

## Views
 You can create new views that are displayed in the result pane. You can also create new home pages. For example, you might want to add a new home page that is associated with a new navigation node that you have created.

## Wizards
 You can integrate your own custom wizards into the Configuration Manager console by using a wizard framework of your choice.

## Management Classes
 You can define your own custom classes that can be used by your Configuration Manager console extension. For more information, see [About console management classes](about-configuration-manager-console-management-classes.md).

## Unsupported Features
 The Configuration Manager console doesn't support the following features:

### Wizard Creation
 You can't create wizards by using the existing Configuration Manager console framework. You also can't modify or remove steps from the existing Configuration Manager wizards.

### Modification of Core Configuration Manager Console Items
 Don't change or remove items in the core Configuration Manager console XML, because this could break the Configuration Manager console. The core XML is stored in *%ProgramFiles%*\Microsoft Endpoint Manager\AdminConsole\XmlStorage\ConsoleRoot.

### SMS 2003 IMMF Interfaces
 The Configuration Manager console is built by using managed code and doesn't support the SMS 2003 IMMF interfaces.

### Registry-Based Extensions
 Registry-based extensions, similar to those available in SMS 2003, aren't supported in the Configuration Manager console.

### Microsoft Management Console SDK Extensions
 Extensions written with the Microsoft Management Console SDK aren't supported by the Configuration Manager console.

## Accessibility

When developing console extensions, they should be based on designs with accessibility considerations.  For example, you can make use of color, layout, intelligent default values, sound, and exposing appropriate keyboard focus.  By using various accessibility techniques, you'll make it easier for users with disabilities to use your software.  For more information, see [Resources for designing accessible applications](/visualstudio/ide/reference/resources-for-designing-accessible-applications).
