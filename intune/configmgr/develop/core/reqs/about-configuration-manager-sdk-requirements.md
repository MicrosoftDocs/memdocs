# About Configuration Manager SDK Requirements
Developing applications and scripts for Microsoft Configuration Manager can be done using a number of development languages and tools. Which one you use depends on the type of application you are writing. Large applications will likely be written in C# using the managed Configuration Manager SDK libraries. VBScript is a good choice for scripting Configuration Manager.

 This documentation provides examples in C#, VBScript and, where appropriate, C++.

> [!NOTE]
>  If you are programming with another .NET Framework language, use the C# examples for reference.

## Development tools

Visual Studio provides a suitable environment for developing Configuration Manager applications and scripts. For more information, see [Visual Studio documentation](/visualstudio).

## Development Requirements
