# How to Connect to the Configuration Manager Client WMI Namespace by Using System.Management
To connect to the Configuration Manager client Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) provider, you create a `ManagementScope` object in the \\\Client\root\ccm namespace.  

 You use the `ManagementScope` object to read and query WMI objects. For example, [How to Read a WMI Object Using System.Management](../../../../develop/core/clients/programming/how-to-read-a-wmi-object-by-using-system.management.md).  

### To connect to the Configuration Manager client WMI provider  

1.  In Visual Studio, create a new Visual C# Console Project.  

2.  Add a reference to the System.Management assembly.  

3.  In the C# source code, add a reference to the System.Management namespace with the following code.  

4.  `using System.Management;`  

5.  Create a new class and add the following connection example code.  

## Example  
 The following C# code example creates and returns a `ManagementScope` object on the root\ccm namespace.  

 For information about calling the sample code, see [How to Call a WMI Class Method by Using System.Management](../../../../develop/core/clients/programming/how-to-call-a-wmi-class-method-by-using-system.management.md).  

```c#  

public ManagementScope Connect()  
{  
    try  
    {  
        return new ManagementScope(@"root\ccm");  
    }  
    catch (System.Management.ManagementException e)  
    {  
        Console.WriteLine("Failed to connect", e.Message);  
        throw;  
    }  
}  

```  

## Compiling the Code  

### Namespaces  
 System  

 System.Management  

### Assembly  
 System.Management.dll  

## Robust Programming  
 The exception that can be raised is [System.Management.ManagementException](/dotnet/api/system.management.managementexception).
