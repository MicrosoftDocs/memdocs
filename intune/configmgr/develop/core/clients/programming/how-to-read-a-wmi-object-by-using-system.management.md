# How to Read a WMI Object by Using System.Management
To read a Configuration Manager client Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) object, in Configuration Manager, you use a `ManagementObject` object to read the WMI object.  

### To read a WMI object  

1.  Set up a connection to the Configuration Manager client WMI namespace. For more information, see [How to Connect to the Configuration Manager Client WMI Namespace by Using System.Management](../../../../develop/core/clients/programming/how-to-connect-to-the-client-wmi-namespace.md).  

2.  Create a `ManagementObject` object.  

3.  Create a `ManagementPath` object with the `ManagementScope` path you obtain from step one.  

4.  Assign the `ManagementPath` object to the `ManagementObject` path property.  

5.  Call the `ManagementObject` object Get method to get the object from the WMI provider.  

6.  Use the `ManagementObject` object to read the WMI provider object properties.  

## Example  
 The following C# code example gets the Configuration Manager client WMI object [SMS_Client](../../../../develop/reference/core/clients/client-classes/sms_client-client-wmi-class.md) object and displays its properties.  

 For information about calling the sample code, see [How to Call a WMI Class Method by Using System.Management](../../../../develop/core/clients/programming/how-to-call-a-wmi-class-method-by-using-system.management.md).  

```c#  

void ReadObject(ManagementScope scope)  
{  
    try  // Gets an instance of a CCM_InstalledComponent.  
    {  
        // Get the object.  
        ManagementObject obj = new ManagementObject();  
        ManagementPath path = new ManagementPath(scope.Path + ":CCM_InstalledComponent.Name='SMSClient'");  

        obj.Path = path;  
        obj.Get();  

        // Display a single property.  
        Console.WriteLine(obj["DisplayName"].ToString());  

        // Display all properties.  
        foreach (PropertyData property in obj.Properties)  
        {  
            Console.WriteLine(property.Name + " " + property.Value);  
        }  
    }  
    catch (ManagementException e)  
    {  
        Console.WriteLine("Failed to get component: " + e.Message);  
        throw;  
    }  
}  
```  

 This example method has the following parameters:  

|Parameter|Type|Description|  
|---------------|----------|-----------------|  
|`scope`|-   `ManagementScope`|The client management scope. The namespace should be root\ccm.|  

## Compiling the Code  

### Namespaces  
 System  

 System.Management  

### Assembly  
 System.Management  

## Robust Programming  
 The exception that can be raised is [System.Management.ManagementException](/dotnet/api/system.management.managementexception).
