# How to Delete a Configuration Manager Object by Using Managed Code
To delete a Configuration Manager object by using the managed SMS Provider, use the [IResultObject.Delete](/previous-versions/system-center/developer/cc146496(v=msdn.10)) method. You can get a [IResultObject](/previous-versions/system-center/developer/cc147376(v=msdn.10)) object for a Configuration Manager object in numerous ways. For more information, see [How to Read a Configuration Manager Object by Using Managed Code](../../../develop/core/understand/how-to-read-a-configuration-manager-object-by-using-managed-code.md)

### To delete a Configuration Manager object

1.  Set up a connection to the SMS Provider. For more information, see [SMS Provider fundamentals](sms-provider-fundamentals.md).

2.  Using the `WqlConnectionManager` object you obtain in step one, call  the `GetInstance` method to get the `IResultObject` object for the Configuration Manager object.

3.  Call the [IResultObject](/previous-versions/system-center/developer/cc147376(v=msdn.10)) object [Delete](/previous-versions/system-center/developer/cc146496(v=msdn.10)) method to delete the Configuration Manager object.

## Example
 The following example deletes a package by using the supplied package identifier. This example uses the **WqlConnectionManager** class **GetInstance** method to get an [IResultObject](/previous-versions/system-center/developer/cc147376(v=msdn.10)) object for the Configuration Manager package and then deletes the package.

 For information about calling the sample code, see [Calling Configuration Manager Code Snippets](../../../develop/core/understand/calling-code-snippets.md).

```
public void DeletePackage(WqlConnectionManager connection, string packageID)
{
    try
    {
        IResultObject package = connection.GetInstance(@"SMS_Package.PackageID='" + packageID + "'");
        package.Delete();
    }
    catch (SmsException ex)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Failed to delete package: " + ex.Message);
        throw;
    }
}

```

 This example method has the following parameters:

|Parameter|Type|Description|
|---------------|----------|-----------------|
|`connection`|-   **WqlConnectionManager**|A valid connection to the SMS Provider.|
|`PackageID`|-   `String`|The package identifier for an existing package. This can be obtained from the [SMS_Package](../../../develop/reference/core/servers/configure/sms_package-server-wmi-class.md) class *PackageID* property.|

## Compiling the Code

### Namespaces
 System

 System.Collections.Generic

 System.ComponentModel

 Microsoft.ConfigurationManagement.ManagementProvider

 Microsoft.ConfigurationManagement.ManagementProvider.WqlQueryEngine

### Assembly
 microsoft.configurationmanagement.managementprovider

 adminui.wqlqueryengine

## Robust Programming
 The Configuration Manager exceptions that can be raised are [SmsConnectionException](/previous-versions/system-center/developer/cc147431(v=msdn.10)) and [SmsQueryException](/previous-versions/system-center/developer/cc147436(v=msdn.10)). These can be caught together with [SmsException](/previous-versions/system-center/developer/cc147433(v=msdn.10)).
