# How to Perform an Asynchronous Configuration Manager Query by Using Managed Code
In Configuration Manager, to perform an asynchronous query by using the managed SMS Provider, you use the [ProcessQuery](/previous-versions/system-center/developer/cc146295(v=msdn.10)) method.

 The first parameter of the [ProcessQuery](/previous-versions/system-center/developer/cc146295(v=msdn.10)) method is an instance of the [SmsBackgroundWorker](/previous-versions/system-center/developer/cc147429(v=msdn.10)) class that provides two event handlers:

- [QueryProcessObjectReady](/previous-versions/system-center/developer/cc143780(v=msdn.10)). This event handler is called for each object returned by the query. The event handler provides an IResultObject object that represents the object.

- [QueryProcessCompleted](/previous-versions/system-center/developer/cc143778(v=msdn.10)). This event handler is called when the query is completed. It also provides information about any errors that occur. For more information, see For information about error handling, see [How to Handle Configuration Manager Asynchronous Errors by Using Managed Code](../../../develop/core/understand/how-to-handle-configuration-manager-asynchronous-errors-by-using-managed-code.md).

  The second parameter to of the [ProcessQuery](/previous-versions/system-center/developer/cc146295(v=msdn.10)) method is the WQL statement for the query.

### To perform an asynchronous query

1.  Set up a connection to the SMS Provider. For more information, see [SMS Provider fundamentals](sms-provider-fundamentals.md).

2.  Create the **SmsBackgroundWorker** object and populate the [QueryProcessorObjectReady](/previous-versions/system-center/developer/cc143780(v=msdn.10)) and [QueryProcessorCompleted](/previous-versions/system-center/developer/cc143778(v=msdn.10)) properties with the callback method names.

3.  From the **WqlConnectionManager** object you obtain in step one, call the **QueryProcessor** object [ProcessQuery](/previous-versions/system-center/developer/cc146295(v=msdn.10)) method to start the asynchronous query.

## Example
 The following example queries for all available SMS_Collection objects, and in the event handler, the example writes several of the collection properties to the Configuration Manager console.

 For information about calling the sample code, see [Calling Configuration Manager Code Snippets](../../../develop/core/understand/calling-code-snippets.md).

```
public void QueryCollections(WqlConnectionManager connection)
{
    try
    {
        // Set up the query.
        SmsBackgroundWorker bw1 = new SmsBackgroundWorker();
        bw1.QueryProcessorObjectReady += new EventHandler<QueryProcessorObjectEventArgs>(bw1_QueryProcessorObjectReady);
        bw1.QueryProcessorCompleted += new EventHandler<RunWorkerCompletedEventArgs>(bw1_QueryProcessorCompleted);

        // Query for all collections.
        connection.QueryProcessor.ProcessQuery(bw1, "select * from SMS_Collection");

        // Pause while query runs.
        Console.ReadLine();
    }
    catch (SmsException ex)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Failed to start asynchronous query: ", ex.Message);
    }
}

void bw1_QueryProcessorObjectReady(object sender, QueryProcessorObjectEventArgs e)
{
    try
    {
        // Get the collection.
        IResultObject collection = (IResultObject)e.ResultObject;

        //Display properties.
        Console.WriteLine(collection["CollectionID"].StringValue);
        Console.WriteLine(collection["Name"].StringValue);
        Console.WriteLine();
        collection.Dispose();
    }
    catch (SmsQueryException eX)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Query Error: " + eX.Message);
    }
}

void bw1_QueryProcessorCompleted(object sender, RunWorkerCompletedEventArgs e)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Done...");
}
```

 This example method has the following parameters:

|Parameter|Type|Description|
|---------------|----------|-----------------|
|`connection`|Managed: `WqlConnectionManager`|A valid connection to the SMS Provider.|

## Compiling the Code

### Namespaces
 System

 System.Collections.Generic

 System.ComponentModel

 Microsoft.ConfigurationManagement.ManagementProvider

 Microsoft.ConfigurationManagement.ManagementProvider.WqlQueryEngine

### Assembly
 microsoft.configurationmanagement.managementprovider

 adminui.wqlqueryengine

## Robust Programming
 The Configuration Manager exceptions that can be raised are [SmsConnectionException](/previous-versions/system-center/developer/cc147431(v=msdn.10)) and [SmsQueryException](/previous-versions/system-center/developer/cc147436(v=msdn.10)). These can be caught together with [SmsException](/previous-versions/system-center/developer/cc147433(v=msdn.10)).
