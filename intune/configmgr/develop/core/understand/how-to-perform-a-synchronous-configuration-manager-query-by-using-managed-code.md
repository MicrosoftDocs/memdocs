# How to Perform a Synchronous Configuration Manager Query by Using Managed Code
To perform a synchronous query by using the managed SMS Provider, you use *WqlConnectionManager.QueryProcessor.ExecuteQuery* method.

 The [ExecuteQuery](/previous-versions/system-center/developer/cc146278(v=msdn.10)) method takes a WQL query string and optional context information for the call. An [IResultObject](/previous-versions/system-center/developer/cc147376(v=msdn.10)) is returned containing the objects found in the query.

### To perform a synchronous query

1.  Set up a connection to the SMS Provider. For more information, see [SMS Provider fundamentals](sms-provider-fundamentals.md).

2.  Using the **WqlConnectionManager** object you obtain in step one, call the **QueryProcessor** object *ExecuteQuery* method to query SMS Provider and get an [IResultObject](/previous-versions/system-center/developer/cc147376(v=msdn.10)) containing a collection of query results.

## Example
 The following code example shows how to make a synchronous query for the available packages by using *ExecuteQuery*.

 For information about calling the sample code, see [Calling Configuration Manager Code Snippets](../../../develop/core/understand/calling-code-snippets.md).

```
public void QueryPackages(WqlConnectionManager connection)
{
    try
    {
        IResultObject query = connection.QueryProcessor.ExecuteQuery("Select * from SMS_Package");
        foreach (IResultObject o in query)
        {
            Console.WriteLine(o["Name"].StringValue);
            o.Dispose();
        }
    }
    catch (SmsException ex)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Failed to query packages: " + ex.Message);
        throw;
    }
}

```

 This example method has the following parameters:

|Parameter|Type|Description|
|---------------|----------|-----------------|
|`connection`|Managed: `WqlConnectionManager`|A valid connection to the SMS Provider.|

## Compiling the Code

### Namespaces
 System

 System.Collections.Generic

 System.ComponentModel

 Microsoft.ConfigurationManagement.ManagementProvider

 Microsoft.ConfigurationManagement.ManagementProvider.WqlQueryEngine

### Assembly
 microsoft.configurationmanagement.managementprovider

 adminui.wqlqueryengine

## Robust Programming
 The Configuration Manager exceptions that can be raised are [SmsConnectionException](/previous-versions/system-center/developer/cc147431(v=msdn.10)) and [SmsQueryException](/previous-versions/system-center/developer/cc147436(v=msdn.10)). These can be caught together with [SmsException](/previous-versions/system-center/developer/cc147433(v=msdn.10)).
