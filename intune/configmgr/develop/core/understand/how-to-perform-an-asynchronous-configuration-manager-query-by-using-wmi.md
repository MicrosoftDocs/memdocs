# How to Perform an Asynchronous Configuration Manager Query by Using WMI
In Configuration Manager, you perform a synchronous query for Configuration Manager objects by calling the [SWbemServices](/windows/win32/wmisdk/swbemservices) object [ExecQueryAsync](/windows/win32/api/wbemcli/nf-wbemcli-iwbemservices-execqueryasync) method and by implementing a sink method to handle query results.

 To handle each returned object, create an [objWbemSink.OnObjectReady](/windows/win32/wmisdk/swbemsink-onobjectready) event subroutine. To be notified when the query is completed, create a [objWbemSink.OnCompleted](/windows/win32/wmisdk/swbemsink-oncompleted) event subroutine.

> [!NOTE]
>  Lazy properties are not returned in asynchronous queries. For more information, see [How to Read Lazy Properties by Using WMI](../../../develop/core/understand/how-to-read-lazy-properties-by-using-wmi.md).

### To perform an asynchronous query

1.  Set up a connection to the SMS Provider. For more information, see [How to Connect to an SMS Provider in Configuration Manager by Using WMI](../../../develop/core/understand/how-to-connect-to-an-sms-provider-in-configuration-manager-by-using-wmi.md).

2.  Create an [OnObjectReady](/windows/win32/wmisdk/swbemsink-onobjectready) subroutine to handle objects by the query.

3.  Create an [OnCompleted](/windows/win32/wmisdk/swbemsink-oncompleted) subroutine to handle query completion.

4.  Using the [SWbemServices](/windows/win32/wmisdk/swbemservices) object you obtain from step one, use [ExecQueryAsync](/windows/win32/api/wbemcli/nf-wbemcli-iwbemservices-execqueryasync) object to query Configuration Manager objects asynchronously.

## Example
 The following VBScript code example asynchronously queries for all [SMS_Collection](../../../develop/reference/core/clients/collections/sms_collection-server-wmi-class.md) objects.

 For information about calling the sample code, see [Calling Configuration Manager Code Snippets](../../../develop/core/understand/calling-code-snippets.md).

```vbs
Dim bdone
Sub QueryCollection(connection)

    Dim sink
    bdone = False

    Set sink = WScript.CreateObject("wbemscripting.swbemsink","sink_")

    ' Query for all collections.
    connection.ExecQueryAsync sink, "select * from SMS_Collection"

    ' Wait until all instances are returned.
    While Not bdone
        wscript.sleep 1000
    Wend
 End Sub

' The sink subroutine to handle the OnObjectReady
' event. This is called as each object returns.
Sub sink_OnObjectReady(collection, octx)
    WScript.Echo "CollectionID: " + collection.CollectionID
    WScript.Echo "Name: " + collection.Name
    Wscript.Echo
End Sub

' The sink subroutine to handle the OnCompleted event.
' This is called when all the objects are returned.
' The oErr parameter obtains an SWbemLastError object,
' if available from the provider.
Sub sink_OnCompleted(HResult, oErr, oCtx)
    WScript.Echo "All collections returned"
    bdone = true
End Sub
```

 This example method has the following parameters:

|Parameter|Type|Description|
|---------------|----------|-----------------|
|`connection`|[SWbemServices](/windows/win32/wmisdk/swbemservices)|A valid connection to the SMS Provider.|
