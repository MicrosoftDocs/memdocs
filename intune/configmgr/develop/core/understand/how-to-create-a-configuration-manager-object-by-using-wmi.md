# How to Create a Configuration Manager Object by Using WMI
You create a Configuration Manager object, in Configuration Manager, by calling the [SWbemObject](/windows/win32/wmisdk/swbemobject) object [SpawnInstance_](/windows/win32/wmisdk/swbemobject-spawninstance-) method.

 The [SWbemObject](/windows/win32/wmisdk/swbemobject) is the class definition for the object type that you want to create. For example, [SMS_Package](../../../develop/reference/core/servers/configure/sms_package-server-wmi-class.md). You get the [SWbemObject](/windows/win32/wmisdk/swbemobject) by calling the [SWBemServices](/windows/win32/wmisdk/swbemservices) object [Get](/windows/win32/wmisdk/swbemservices-get) method.

### To create a Configuration Manager object

1.  Set up a connection to the SMS Provider. For more information, see [How to Connect to an SMS Provider in Configuration Manager by Using WMI](../../../develop/core/understand/how-to-connect-to-an-sms-provider-in-configuration-manager-by-using-wmi.md).

2.  Using the [SWBemServices](/windows/win32/wmisdk/swbemservices) object you obtain from step one, call [Get](/windows/win32/wmisdk/swbemservices-get) to get the [SWbemObject](/windows/win32/wmisdk/swbemobject) for the Configuration Manager object class definition.

3.  Call [SpawnInstance_](/windows/win32/wmisdk/swbemobject-spawninstance-) on the SWbemObject to create the new object. An SWbemObject is returned for the new object.

4.  Using the SWbemObject returned from the call to SpawnInstance, populate the object properties.

5.  Call [Put_](/windows/win32/wmisdk/swbemobject-put-) to commit the new object to the SMS Provider.

## Example
 The following VBScript code example creates an [SMS_Package](../../../develop/reference/core/servers/configure/sms_package-server-wmi-class.md) object.

 For information about calling the sample code, see [Calling Configuration Manager Code Snippets](../../../develop/core/understand/calling-code-snippets.md).

```vbs
Sub CreatePackage (connection)

    On Error Resume Next

    ' Create a package object.
    Set package = connection.Get("SMS_Package").SpawnInstance_()

    If Err.Number<>0 Then
        Wscript.Echo "Couldn't create packages object"
        Exit Sub
    End If

    ' Populate the object.
    package.Name = "Test Package"
    package.Description = "A test package"
    package.PkgSourceFlag = 2
    package.PkgSourcePath = "C:\temp"

    package.Put_

    If Err.Number<>0 Then
        Wscript.Echo "Couldn't commit the package"
        Exit Sub
    End If

    WScript.Echo "Package created"
End Sub
```

 This example method has the following parameters:

|Parameter|Type|Description|
|---------------|----------|-----------------|
|`Connection`|[SWBemServices](/windows/win32/wmisdk/swbemservices)|A valid connection to the SMS Provider.|
