# How to Read Lazy Properties by Using Managed Code
To read a lazy property from a Configuration Manager object returned in a query, you get the object instance, which retrieves any lazy object properties from the SMS Provider.

> [!NOTE]
>  If you know the full path to the WMI object, a call to the [GetInstance](/previous-versions/system-center/developer/cc146190(v=msdn.10)) method returns the WMI object along with any lazy properties. For more information, see [How to Read a Configuration Manager Object by Using Managed Code](../../../develop/core/understand/how-to-read-a-configuration-manager-object-by-using-managed-code.md).

 For more information, see [Configuration Manager Lazy Properties](../../../develop/core/understand/configuration-manager-lazy-properties.md).

### To read lazy properties

1.  Set up a connection to the SMS Provider. For more information, see [How to Connect to an SMS Provider in Configuration Manager by Using Managed Code](../../../develop/core/understand/how-to-connect-to-an-sms-provider-by-using-managed-code.md).

2.  Use **QueryProcessor** object to query Configuration Manager objects.

3.  Iterate through the query results.

4.  Using the **WqlConnectionManager** you obtain in step one, call [GetInstance](/previous-versions/system-center/developer/cc146190(v=msdn.10)) to get the [IResultObject](/previous-versions/system-center/developer/cc147376(v=msdn.10)) object for each queried object that you want to get lazy properties from.

## Example
 The following C# code example queries for all [SMS_Collection](../../../develop/reference/core/clients/collections/sms_collection-server-wmi-class.md) objects and then displays rule names obtained from the `CollectionRules` lazy property.

 For information about calling the sample code, see [Calling Configuration Manager Code Snippets](../../../develop/core/understand/calling-code-snippets.md).

```
public void ReadLazyProperty(WqlConnectionManager connection)
{
    try
    {
        // Query all collections.
        IResultObject collections = connection.QueryProcessor.ExecuteQuery("Select * from SMS_Collection");
        foreach (IResultObject collection in collections)
        {
            // Get the collection object and lazy properties.
            collection.Get();

            Console.WriteLine(collection["Name"].StringValue);

            // Get the rules.
            List<IResultObject> rules = collection.GetArrayItems("CollectionRules");
            if (rules.Count == 0)
            {
                Console.WriteLine("No rules");
                Console.WriteLine();
                continue;
            }

            foreach (IResultObject rule in rules)
            {
                // Display rule names.
                Console.WriteLine("Rule name: " + rule["RuleName"].StringValue);
            }

            Console.WriteLine();
        }
    }
    catch (SmsQueryException ex)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Failed to get collection. Error: " + ex.Message);
        throw;
    }
}

```

 This example method has the following parameters:

|Parameter|Type|Description|
|---------------|----------|-----------------|
|`connection`|-   `WqlConnectionManager`|A valid connection to the SMS Provider.|

## Compiling the Code

### Namespaces
 System

 System.Collections.Generic

 System.ComponentModel

 Microsoft.ConfigurationManagement.ManagementProvider

 Microsoft.ConfigurationManagement.ManagementProvider.WqlQueryEngine

### Assembly
 microsoft.configurationmanagement.managementprovider

 adminui.wqlqueryengine

## Robust Programming
 The Configuration Manager exceptions that can be raised are [SmsConnectionException](/previous-versions/system-center/developer/cc147431(v=msdn.10)) and [SmsQueryException](/previous-versions/system-center/developer/cc147436(v=msdn.10)). These can be caught together with [SmsException](/previous-versions/system-center/developer/cc147433(v=msdn.10)).
