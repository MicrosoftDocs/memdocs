# Deployment Type Extension Versioning

Configuration Manager supports in-place versioning for minor upgrades and out-of-place versioning for major upgrades.

## Versioning

### Minor Revisions

Configuration Manager supports in-place versioning for minor upgrades that are backwards compatible. For in-place versioning, increment the version number.

### Major Revisions

Configuration Manager supports out-of-place versioning for major upgrades that aren't backwards compatible. For out-of-place versioning, it's necessary to create a new extension and technology ID.
