# Troubleshoot and Monitor Remote Help

[!INCLUDE [intune-add-on-note](../includes/intune-add-on-note.md)]

[!INCLUDE [remote-help-overview](includes/remote-help-overview.md)]

## Monitoring and reports

You can monitor the use of Remote Help from within the Microsoft Intune admin center. For unenrolled devices, reporting on Remote Help sessions is limited.

1. Sign into the [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431) and go to **Tenant admin** > **Remote Help**.

2. On the Monitor tab, you can see a count of active sessions and historical data about past sessions.

3. On the Remote Help sessions tab, you can see the records of past sessions, including:
   - The helper (Provider ID) and sharer (Recipient ID) of each session.
   - The device that received assistance.
   - The start and end time of the Remote Assistance session.
   - The type of control session.

> [!NOTE]
> - The Recipient ID and Recipient name display "--" for Android Enterprise Dedicated devices, as these devices don't have user affinity.
> - The use of the Windows "elevation" capability isn't reported in the Remote Help sessions report.

These logs persist for 30 days on Microsoft's servers. The content of a session, like screen images or keystrokes, aren't recorded â€“ only metadata is stored.

## Log files

Remote Help logs data during installation and during Remote Help sessions, which can be of use when investigating issues with the app.

**Installation of Remote Help** - When Remote Help installs or uninstalls, the following two logs are created in the device users' Temp folder, for example, `C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\Temp`. The `*` in the log file name represents a date and time stamp of when the log was created.

- Remote_help_*_QuickAssist_Win10_x64.msi.log
- Remote_help_*.log

**Operational logs** - During use of Remote Help, operational details are logged in the Windows Event Viewer:

- Event Viewer > Application and Services > Microsoft > Windows > RemoteHelp

  |-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
  | Remote Help is enabled for the tenant | In the Intune admin center, go to **Tenant administration** > **Remote Help** and ensure that Remote Help is enabled. It can take up to 30 minutes (or a few hours in some cases) after assigning licenses for the service to activate. |
  | The helper and sharer are using supported platforms and versions | See [Plan Remote Help](remote-help-plan.md#supported-platforms) for details. |
  | The helper has the required permissions | The helper must be assigned to an Intune role with Remote Help permissions and have the "Offer remote assistance" permission. See [Assign Remote Help permissions to helpers](remote-help-plan.md#role-based-access-control-rbac) for details. |
  | The helper and sharer are signing in with organizational accounts from the same tenant | Both the helper and sharer must sign in with a Microsoft Entra account from your organization. You can't use Remote Help to assist users who aren't members of your organization. |
  | The helper and sharer have network access to the required endpoints | See [Network endpoints for Remote Help](remote-help-plan.md#network-considerations) for details. |

  | The device is in *do not disturb* mode | If the device is in *do not disturb* mode, notifications for Remote Help session requests won't be shown. Disable *don't disturb* mode and try again or ask the sharer to check their notifications pane. |

#### Troubleshooting Remote Help on Windows for Microsoft Edge WebView2

## Known Issues

### [:::image type="icon" source="../../media/icons/platforms/windows.svg"::: **Windows**](#tab/windows)

For Windows devices, the following are known issues with Remote Help when using the remote launch feature:
- Notifications for remotely triggering a Remote Help session fail if the *Microsoft Intune Management Service* isn't running.
- After the user's device is restarted, there's a short delay for the *Microsoft Intune Management Service* to start. Either wait for the *Microsoft Intune Management Service* to start or ask the sharer to open the app and share the code.
- For newly enrolled devices, there's a 1 hour delay before the user's device begins receiving notifications when a helper initiates a session.

### [:::image type="icon" source="../../media/icons/platforms/macos.svg"::: **macOS**](#tab/macos)

- If the sharer exits from a Remote Help session early, the helper might not be notified for 60+ seconds.
- If using Microsoft Edge, the sharer might have to sign in to Microsoft Edge before starting a session or the device reports as Unenrolled.
- Verify that your browser is up to date.
- If you're screen sharing using another application like Teams or recording during the session, it might take longer for the session to connect.

### [:::image type="icon" source="../../media/icons/platforms/android.svg"::: **Android**](#tab/android)

- On newly enrolled devices, push notifications, needed for Remote Help to receive session initiation requests, can take a while to start working. Wait for 15 minutes and try again later.
