## Week of June 23, 2025 (Service release 2506)

### App management

#### Add Enterprise App Catalog apps to ESP blocking apps list<!-- 29846319 -->

Windows Autopilot now supports Enterprise App Catalog apps. Microsoft Intune Enterprise App Management enables IT admins to easily manage applications from the Enterprise App Catalog. Using Windows Autopilot, you can select apps from the Enterprise App Catalog as blocking apps in the Enrollment Status Page (ESP) and the Device Preparation Page (DPP) profiles. This allows you to ensure those apps are delivered before the user can access the desktop.

For related information, see [Set up the Enrollment Status Page](../enrollment/windows-enrollment-status.md), [Overview of Windows Autopilot device preparation](/autopilot/device-preparation/overview), and [Add an Enterprise App Catalog app to Microsoft Intune](../apps/apps-add-enterprise-app.md).

Applies to:

- Windows

#### Managed Home Screen orientation changes with Android 16<!-- 30316862 -->

Starting with Android 16, Android stops enforcing screen orientation on devices with 600dp and larger display settings. This change impacts the Managed Home Screen (MHS) on devices with larger form factors, like tablets.

On these Android 16 devices, orientation is determined by the deviceâ€™s orientation setting, not the MHS settings you configure.

To learn more about Android 16 changes, go to [Behavior changes: Apps targeting Android 16 or higher](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/16/behavior-changes-16) (opens Android website).

Applies to:

- Android Enterprise


### Device configuration

#### New settings available in the Apple settings catalog<!-- 32498293 -->

The [Settings Catalog](../configuration/settings-catalog.md) lists all the settings you can configure in a device policy, and all in one place. For more information about configuring settings catalog profiles in Intune, go to [Create a policy using settings catalog](../configuration/settings-catalog.md).

There are new settings in the settings catalog. To see these settings, in the [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431), go to **Devices** > **Manage devices** > **Configuration** > **Create** > **New policy** > **iOS/iPadOS** or **macOS** for platform > **Settings catalog** for profile type.

##### iOS/iPadOS

**Managed Settings**:

- Idle Reboot Allowed

##### macOS

**Authentication > Extensible Single Sign On (SSO)**:

- Allow Device Identifiers In Attestation

**Microsoft Edge**:

- The Microsoft Edge category has been updated with hundreds of new settings. Learn more about available macOS Edge settings at [Microsoft Edge - Policies](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies).

Apple deprecated the Identification payload in macOS 15.4.

#### New Block Bluetooth setting in the Android Enterprise settings catalog<!-- 15583647 -->

The [Settings Catalog](../configuration/settings-catalog.md) lists all the settings you can configure in a device policy, and all in one place. For more information about configuring Settings Catalog profiles in Intune, see [Create a policy using settings catalog](../configuration/settings-catalog.md).

There's a new **Block Bluetooth** setting (**Devices** > **Manage devices** > **Configuration** > **Create** > **New policy** > **Android Enterprise** for platform > **Settings catalog** for profile type). When set to **True**, Bluetooth is disabled on the device.

There's also a **Block Bluetooth Configuration** setting that prevents end users from changing the Bluetooth setting on the device.

These settings are different and have different results. Some examples include:

- **Scenario**: An end user turned on the Bluetooth setting on their device. The admin creates an Intune policy that sets the **Block Bluetooth** setting to **True**.

  In this situation, Bluetooth is blocked on the device, even though the end user turned it on.

- **Scenario**: An end user turned on the Bluetooth setting on their device. The admin creates an Intune policy that sets the **Block Bluetooth Configuration** setting to **True**.

  In this situation, Bluetooth is turned on since the end user previously turned it on. The end user can't turn off Bluetooth. If the end user previously turned Bluetooth off, and then the **Block Bluetooth Configuration** policy applies, then Bluetooth is turned off and the end user can't turn it back on.

For a list of existing settings you can configure in the settings catalog, see [Android Enterprise device settings list in the Intune settings catalog](../configuration/settings-catalog-android.md).

Applies to:

- Android Enterprise corporate-owned devices with a work profile (COPE)
- Android Enterprise corporate owned fully managed (COBO)
- Android Enterprise corporate owned dedicated devices (COSU)

### Device management

#### New reporting system for improved performance and data consistency<!-- 31823383 -->

Microsoft Intune is rolling out the new Policy Reporting Service (PRS) V3. The new system brings faster report generation, improved reliability, and better data consistency.
 
In the first phase, some high-traffic compliance and device configuration reports are transitioning to the new system.
 
Users will notice quicker updates in the Intune admin center and fewer issues with stale data. No action is required from users, as your reports transition automatically.

To learn more about the Intune reports you can use, see [Intune reports](reports.md).

### Device security

#### New attributes and S/MIME baseline requirements for SCEP certificate profiles <!-- 33116047 -->

Intune supports two new attributes for subject name settings in SCEP and PKCS device configuration profiles. They include:

- G={{GivenName}}
- SN={{SurName}}

Beginning July 16th, you are required to use these attributes in the subject name format if you're using a third party public certificate authority (CA) integrated with the Intune SCEP API for issuing S\MIME (encryption or signing) certificates anchored up to a public root CA. After that date, a public CA will not issue or sign S\MIME certificates that omit these attributes. 

For more information, see [S/MIME certificate requirements for third party public CA](../protect/certificates-profile-scep.md#smime-certificate-requirements-for-third-party-public-ca).

### Intune apps

#### Newly available protected apps for Intune<!-- 32647747, 32692741, 32775449, 32920017 -->

The following protected apps are now available for Microsoft Intune:

- Datasite for Intune by Datasite (iOS)

## Device security

#### Vulnerability Remediation Agent for Intune (public preview)<!-- 33475311 -->
 
The Vulnerability Remediation Agent is currently in a limited public preview and available to only a select group of customers. If youâ€™re interested in gaining access or would like to learn more, please reach out to your sales team for further details and next steps.

When run, this agent uses data from Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management to identify and then provide remediation guidance for vulnerabilities on your managed devices. You run and access the agent and view its results from within the Intune admin center where youâ€™ll see suggestions prioritized by the agent for remediation. Each suggestion includes key information like associated CVEs, severity, exploitability, affected systems, organizational exposure, business impact, and remediation guidance.
 
This information empowers you with a current assessment of potential risk to your environment and guidance to help you decide which risk to address first.

For more information about this agent including prerequisites, see [Vulnerability Remediation Agent for Security Copilot in Microsoft Intune](../protect/vulnerability-remediation-agent.md).

## Week of May 26, 2025 (Service release 2505)

### Microsoft Intune Suite

#### Endpoint Privilege Management rules explicitly deny elevation<!-- 30225542 -->
 
Endpoint Privilege Management (EPM) elevation rules now include a new file elevation type of **Deny**. An EPM elevation rule set to *Deny* blocks the specified file from running in an elevated context. While we recommend using file elevation rules to allow users to elevate specific files, a deny rule can help you ensure that certain files like known and potentially malicious software can't be run in an elevated context.

*Deny* rules support the same configuration options as other [elevation types](../protect/epm-policies.md#manually-configure-elevation-rules-for-windows-elevation-rules-policy) except for child processes, which aren't used.

For more information about EPM, which is available as an [Intune Suite add-on-capability](../fundamentals/intune-add-ons.md), see [Endpoint Privilege Management overview](../protect/epm-overview.md).

### App management

#### Newly available protected apps for Intune<!-- 31844143, 31974161, 32037902, 32038043 -->

#### New endpoint security profile for configuring Endpoint detection and response and Antivirus exclusion settings on Linux devices <!-- 26549863 -->

As part of the Intune scenario for [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint security settings management](../protect/mde-security-integration.md), you can use a new *Endpoint detection and response* profile for Linux named [**Microsoft Defender Global Exclusions (AV+EDR)**](../protect/endpoint-security-edr-policy.md#linux) that you can now use to manage Linux device exclusions for both Microsoft Defender *Endpoint detection and response* (EDR) and *Antivirus* (AV).

This profile supports settings related to global exclusion settings as detailed in [Configure and validate exclusions on Linux](/defender-endpoint/linux-exclusions) in the Microsoft Defender documentation. These exclusion configurations can apply to both the antivirus and EDR engines on the Linux client to stop associated real time protection EDR alerts for excluded items. Exclusions can be defined by the file path, folder, or process explicitly defined by the admin in the policy.

The new Intune profile:

- Is available in addition to the existing endpoint security Antivirus policy for Microsoft Defender Antivirus.
- Is supported for devices you manage through the [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint security settings management](../protect/mde-security-integration.md) scenario.
- Isn't supported for Linux devices managed directly by Intune.

For details about the available Defender settings, see [Configure security settings in Microsoft Defender for Endpoint on Linux - Microsoft Defender for Endpoint](/defender-endpoint/linux-preferences) in the Defender for Endpoint documentation.

### App management

#### Intune support for Apple specialty devices<!-- 32486291 -->
We've extended app protection policies (APP) to support Microsoft Edge (v136 or later), OneDrive (v16.8.4 or later), and Outlook (v4.2513.0 or later). To enable this setting for these specific apps on visionOS devices, you must set `com.microsoft.intune.mam.visionOSAllowiPadCompatApps` to `Enabled` in your app configuration policy. Once you have assigned your app configuration policy, you can create and assign your app protection policy for your VisionOS devices. For more information, see [Protect data on VisionOS devices](../apps/app-configuration-policies-managed-app.md#protect-data-on-visionos-devices).

### Tenant administration

#### New icon for Microsoft Intune<!-- 29148691 -->
Microsoft Intune has a new icon. The Intune icon is being updated across platforms and apps associated with Intune, such as the Intune admin center and Intune Company Portal app. The new icon will gradually be implemented over the next few months.

## Week of April 21, 2025 (Service release 2504)

### Microsoft Intune Suite

#### Endpoint Privilege Management elevation rule support for file arguments and parameters<!-- 28077130 -->

File elevation rules for Endpoint Privilege Management (EPM) now support [command line file arguments](../protect/epm-policies.md#use-file-arguments-for-elevation-rules). When an elevation rule is configured to define one or more file arguments, EPM allows that file to run in an elevated request only when one of the defined arguments is used. EPM blocks elevation of the file should a command line argument be used that isn't defined by the elevation rule. Use of file arguments in your file elevation rules can help you refine how and for what intent different files are successfully run in an elevated context by Endpoint Privilege Management.

EPM is available as an [Intune Suite add-on-capability](../fundamentals/intune-add-ons.md).

### App management

#### Relationship viewer available for Intune apps<!-- 17644546 -->

The relationship viewer provides a graphical depiction of the relationships between different applications in the system, including superseding and dependent applications. Admins can find relationship viewer in Intune by selecting **Apps** > **All apps** > *a Win32 app* > **Relationship viewer**. The relationship viewer supports both Win32 apps and Enterprise App Catalog apps. For more information, see [App relationship viewer](../apps/apps-win32-app-management.md#app-relationship-viewer).

#### Apple VPP using new API v2.0<!-- 29567109 -->

Apple recently updated the API for their volume purchase program (VPP), which is used to manage apps and books. Apple's related API is now version 2.0. Version 1.0 is deprecated. To support the Apple updates, Microsoft Intune has updated to use the new API, which is faster and more scalable than the previous version.

Applies to:

- iOS/iPadOS
- macOS

#### Additional org data storage service options for Android and iOS apps<!-- 29606862 -->

Intune now provides additional storage services options when saving copies of org data using an app protection policy for Android or iOS. In addition to the existing org data storage options, you can also select **iManage** and **Egnyte** as storage options. You must select these services as exemptions from your block list by setting **Save copies of org data** to **Block**, then selecting the allowed storage services next to the **Allow user to save copies to selected services** setting. Note that this setting doesn't apply to all applications.

For more information about data protection using app protection policies, see [iOS app protection policy settings - Data protection](../apps/app-protection-policy-settings-ios.md#data-protection) and [Android app protection policy settings - Data protection](../apps/app-protection-policy-settings-android.md#data-protection).

### Device configuration

#### Updated device configuration template for Windows Delivery Optimization<!-- 32411831 -->

We've updated the device configuration template for Windows [Delivery Optimization](../configuration/delivery-optimization-windows.md). The new template uses the settings format as found in the Settings Catalog, with settings that are taken directly from the Windows Configuration Service Providers (CSPs) for Windows Delivery Optimization, as documented by Windows at [Policy CSP â€“ DeliveryOptimization](/windows/client-management/mdm/policy-csp-DeliveryOptimization).

With this change you can no longer create new versions of the old profile. However, your preexisting instances of the old profile remain available to use.

For more information about this change, see the Intune Customer Success blog at [Support tip: Windows device configuration policies migrating to unified settings platform in Intune](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/intunecustomersuccess/support-tip-windows-device-configuration-policies-migrating-to-unified-settings-/4189665).

Applies to:

- Windows 10
- Windows 11

#### New settings available in the Apple settings catalog<!-- 31523569 -->

The [Settings Catalog](../configuration/settings-catalog.md) lists all the settings you can configure in a device policy, and all in one place. For more information about configuring Settings Catalog profiles in Intune, see [Create a policy using settings catalog](../configuration/settings-catalog.md).

We've added a new setting in the Settings Catalog. To see this setting, in the [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431), see **Devices** > **Manage devices** > **Configuration** > **Create** > **New policy** > **macOS** for platform > **Settings catalog** for profile type.

#### Enrollment-time grouping for Android Enterprise corporate devices <!-- 17530981 -->

Now available for Android Enterprise corporate-owned devices, *enrollment time grouping* enables you to assign a static Microsoft Entra group to devices at enrollment time. When a targeted Android device enrolls, it receives all assigned policies, apps, and settings, typically by the time the user lands on the home screen. You can configure one static Microsoft Entra group per enrollment profile under the **Device group** tab in the Microsoft Intune admin center. For more information, see [Enrollment time grouping](../enrollment/enrollment-time-grouping.md).

### Device management

#### Intune ending support for custom profiles for personally owned work profile devices<!-- 27424084 -->

Starting in April 2025, Intune no longer supports custom profiles for Android Enterprise personally owned work profile devices. With this end of support:

- Admins won't be able to create new custom profiles for personally owned work profile devices. However, admins can still view and edit previously created custom profiles.

- Personally-owned work profile devices that currently have a custom profile assigned won't experience any immediate change of functionality. Because these profiles are no longer supported, the functionality set by these profiles might change in the future.

- Intune technical support no longer supports custom profiles for personally owned work profile devices.

All custom policies should be replaced with other policy types. Learn more about [Intune ending support for personally owned work profile custom profiles](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/intunecustomersuccess/intune-ending-support-for-custom-profiles-for-personally-owned-work-profile-devi/4287414)

### Device security

#### New settings added to the Windows security baseline version 24H2<!-- 32413310 -->

> [!NOTE]
> Rollout of the new settings for the security baseline is underway, but taking longer than usual. Due to this delay, the new settings might not be available until the week of May 5, 2025.

The most recent Intune security baseline for Windows, version 24H2, is updated to include 15 new settings for managing the Windows Configuration Service Provider (CSP) for [*Lanman Server*](/windows/client-management/mdm/policy-csp-lanmanserver) and [*Lanman Workstation*](/windows/client-management/mdm/policy-csp-lanmanworkstation). These settings were previously unavailable in the baseline due to missing CSP support. The addition of these settings provides better control and configuration options.
 
Because this is an update to an existing baseline version and not a new baseline version, the new settings aren't visible in the baselines properties until you edit and save the baseline:
 
- **Pre-existing baseline instances**:  
Before the new settings are available in a preexisting baseline instance, you must select and then *Edit* that baseline instance. To have the baseline deploy the new settings, you must then *Save* that baseline instance. When the baseline is opened for editing, each of the new settings becomes visible with its default security baseline configuration. Before saving, you can reconfigure one or more of the new settings or make no changes other than to save the current configuration that then uses the baseline defaults for each of the new settings.

- **New baseline instances**:  
When you create a new instance of a Windows security baseline version 24H2, that instance includes the new settings along with all the previously available settings.
 
Following are the new settings that are added to the version 24H2 baseline, and the baseline default for each:
[**Lanman Server**](../protect/security-baseline-settings-mdm-all.md?pivots=mdm-24h2#lanman-server)

It was possible to configure these in the past with Custom Configuration policies, but going forward, we recommend setting these in the Wi-Fi Configuration profile, because [Intune is ending support for Custom policies in April 2024.](https://aka.ms/Intune/Android-customprofiles).

For more information, see [Wi-Fi settings for personally-owned work profile devices.](../configuration/wi-fi-settings-android-enterprise.md).

### Device enrollment

#### Change to enrollment behavior for iOS enrollment profile type<!-- 29068674 -->

At Apple WWDC 2024, Apple ended support for profile-based Apple user enrollment. For more information, see [Support has ended for profile-based user enrollment with Company Portal](../fundamentals/whats-new-archive.md#support-has-ended-for-apple-profile-based-user-enrollment-with-company-portal). As a result of this change, we updated the behavior that occurs when you select **Determine based on user choice** as the enrollment profile type for bring-your-own-device (BYOD) enrollments.

Now when users select **I own this device** during a BYOD enrollment, Microsoft Intune enrolls them via account-driven user enrollment, rather than profile-based user enrollment, and then secures only work-related apps. Less than one percent of Apple devices across all Intune tenants are currently enrolled this way, so this change doesn't affect most enrolled devices. There is no change for iOS users who select **My company owns this device** during a BYOD enrollment. Intune enrolls them via device enrollment with Intune Company Portal, and then secures their entire device.

If you currently allow users in BYOD scenarios to determine their enrollment profile type, you must take action to ensure account-driven user enrollment works by completing all prerequisites. For more information, see [Set up account driven Apple user enrollment](../enrollment/apple-account-driven-user-enrollment.md). If you don't give users the option to choose their enrollment profile type, there are no action items.

### Device management

#### Device Inventory for Windows<!-- 24853010 -->

Device inventory lets you collect and view additional hardware properties from your managed devices to help you better understand the state of your devices and make business decisions.

You can now choose what you want to collect from your devices, using the catalog of properties and then view the collected properties in the Resource Explorer view.

For more information, see:

- [Properties catalog](../configuration/properties-catalog.md)
- [Data collection platform](../../analytics/data-platform-schema.md)

Applies to:
