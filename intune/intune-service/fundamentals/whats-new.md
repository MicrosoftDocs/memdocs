### Microsoft Intune Suite

#### Support for user account context in Endpoint Privilege Management Elevation Rules<!-- 25617968 -->

Endpoint Privilege Management (EPM) has a new option for elevation rules that runs the elevated file using the userâ€™s context instead of a virtual account. The option is **Elevate as current user**.

With the *Elevate as current user* elevation type, files or processes that are elevated run under the signed-in user's own account, rather than a virtual account. This preserves the user's profile paths, environment variables, and personalized settings, helping to ensure that installers and tools that rely on the active user profile function correctly. Because the elevated process maintains the same user identity before and after elevation, audit trails remain consistent and accurate. Prior to elevation, the user is required to enter their credentials for Windows Authentication. This process supports multifactor authentication (MFA) for enhanced security.

For more information, see [Use Endpoint Privilege Management with Microsoft Intune](../protect/epm-plan.md#important-concepts-for-endpoint-privilege-management).

####  Endpoint Privilege Management Dashboard for user readiness and elevation trends<!-- 26123334 -->

You can now use an Endpoint Privilege Management (EPM) dashboard that presents insights about file elevations and trends in your organization and help identify users that might be ready to be moved to run as standard users in place of running with local admin permissions.

Insights provided by the dashboard include:

- Users who have only unmanaged file elevations
- Users who have both managed and unmanaged file elevations
- User with only managed elevations
- Frequently unmanaged elevations
- Frequently approved by support
- Frequently denied elevations

For more information about the dashboard and these new insights, see [Overview dashboard](../protect/epm-reports.md#elevation-report-by-user) in Reports for Endpoint Privilege Management.

### Device configuration

#### System Info property available in properties catalog for device inventory<!-- 30326613 -->

You can create a [properties catalog](../configuration/properties-catalog.md) policy that lets you collect and view hardware properties from your managed Windows devices. There's a **System Info** category that shows system-level device insights, like OS version, hardware details, and configuration state.

## Week of September 22, 2025

### Device security

#### Update for the Vulnerability Remediation Agent for Security Copilot in Intune (public preview)<!-- 35028555 -->

We've updated the Vulnerability Remediation Agent for Security Copilot, adding the following changes to the ongoing limited public preview:

- **Role-based access control (RBAC) for Microsoft Defender** - We've updated the [RBAC guidance](../protect/vulnerability-remediation-agent.md#role-based-access-control-and-permissions) to reflect how RBAC is implemented in Microsoft Defender XDR. Guidance is now provided for configurations that use [**Unified RBAC**](/defender-xdr/manage-rbac) (a single set of permissions across services) and for [**granular RBAC**](/defender-endpoint/rbac) (customized permissions per service).

  When using granular RBAC configurations, ensure the agent's identity is scoped in Microsoft Defender to include all relevant device groups. The agent can't access or report on devices outside its assigned scope.

- **Agent Identity** â€“ You can now [manually change the account that the agent uses as its identity](../protect/vulnerability-remediation-agent.md#change-the-agent-identity). From the agents *Settings* tab, select **Choose another identity** to open a sign-in prompt. Enter and authenticate the new account. Ensure the new account has sufficient permission to access the Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Remediation data.

  Changes to the agent's identity won't affect the agent's run history, which remains available.

These updates provide greater flexibility and control for organizations using the Vulnerability Remediation Agent in preview. To learn more about this Agent, see [Vulnerability Remediation Agent for Security Copilot in Microsoft Intune](../protect/vulnerability-remediation-agent.md).

### Device management

#### Device category management supports Multi Admin Approval<!-- 26838632 -->

Intune [device categories](../enrollment/device-group-mapping.md) support Multi Admin Approval. When Multi Admin Approval is enabled, changes to device categories, including creating a new one, editing or deleting one, require a second administrator to approve the change before it's applied. This dual authorization process helps protect your organization from unauthorized or accidental role-based access control changes.

For more information on multiple administrative approval, see [Use multiple administrative approvals in Intune](../fundamentals/multi-admin-approval.md).

### Device security

#### New security baseline update experience<!-- 31607281  -->

The Intune security baseline update experience is updated for the more recent versions of security baselines. With this change, when you update a security baseline that was created after May 2023 to a more recent version of that same baseline, you now have two options to help automatically configure the updated baseline:

- Keep customizations â€“ With this option, Intune applies all the settings customizations from the original baseline that you're upgrading to the new baselines template. The result is that the new baseline instance retains (includes) all your organization's specific modifications.
- Discard customizations â€“ With this option, Intune creates a new 'default' baseline instance that uses the new baseline version. Each setting in that baseline uses the baseline default and none of your settings customizations are automatically applied.

With both options, your decision is applied to a new profile instance of that baseline, which uses the latest baseline version. This new profile won't have the scope tags or assignments from the original, which you can add later after the new profile has been created. This change gives you time to configure other settings if desired before the updated profile is assigned and begins to deploy the latest baseline version to devices. Meanwhile, your original baseline is left unchanged and remains active. But, its setting configurations become read-only.

For more information, see [Update a baseline profile to the latest version](../protect/security-baselines-configure.md#update-a-baseline-profile-to-the-latest-version)  in Manage security baseline profiles in Microsoft Intune.

#### Company Portal supports Purebred's new derived credentials experience<!--31973776-->

Apple released iOS 26 and iPadOS 26. With this update, Purebred (version 3) introduces a new and improved derived credentials experience. As part of day zero support, Company Portal supports Purebred's updated workflow.

- If your organization plans to continue using the older version of Purebred, there are no changes to your derived credentials experience in Purebred or Company Portalâ€”even if you upgrade to the latest version of Company Portal.
- If your organization plans to upgrade to the new version of Purebred, make sure to update to Company Portal version 5.2509.0 to ensure compatibility.

#### Enrollment Status Page support for installing Windows security updates during Windows OOBE <!-- 7183120 -->

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> As of September 9, 2025, this capability is delayed to help ensure delivery of the best possible experience. The new setting on the Enrollment Status Page (ESP) can be configured on both new and existing ESP profiles, but the automatic installation of monthly security update releases and the new user interface isn't available yet. This post will be updated with a revised timeline as soon as it's available.

The Windows out-of-box experience (OOBE) by default installs the latest available security updates to help ensure devices are secure and up to date from day one. Windows OOBE is used by Intune and by Windows Autopilot scenarios through the Intune enrollment status page (ESP) configurations. Intune refers to these security updates Windows quality updates.

To help you manage this behavior, we've updated the Intune enrollment status page with a new setting you can use to allow or block the automatic installation of these updates.

The new setting is **Install Windows quality updates**. These security updates, also known as Windows quality updates in Intune, are installed by default during the Windows out-of-box experience OOBE that's used by Intune and by Windows Autopilot.

By default, this setting is set to *Yes* in all new ESP profiles you create, which results in the most recent security updates being installed. In all your previously created ESP profiles, this setting is set to *No* until you choose to edit those profiles to change it. When set to *No*, OOBE doesn't install the updates, which can give your internal teams time to test the updates before allowing them to install on new devices you provision.

For more information about the Intune enrollment status page, see [Set up Enrollment Status Page](/intune/intune-service/enrollment/windows-enrollment-status). For information about Windows quality updates, see [Windows quality update policy](/intune/intune-service/protect/windows-quality-update-policy).

### Device security

### Device configuration recommendations from the Security Copilot Vulnerability Remediation Intune agent<!-- 34346149 -->

To help reduce your organization's attack surface against vulnerabilities, the Security Copilot Vulnerability Remediation Intune agent now provides recommended configurations for settings related to a reported vulnerability.

You can find the recommended configurations after selecting *Agent suggestions* for a reported vulnerability, which opens the *Suggested action* pane. On the suggested action pane, there's a new section of information titled **Configurations**.

If the Intune settings catalog contains relevant settings for the reported vulnerability, the Configurations section provides information to help you configure device policies. These policies can help minimize future risk from that vulnerability, including:

- A list of the settings that are relevant to the current vulnerability, which can be deployed through an Intune settings catalog policy. Only the specific settings that are relevant to the vulnerability are listed.
- Each setting is presented with a recommended configuration.
- Selecting the citation icon next to a setting displays that settings description. The description can also include a link to content for the Configuration Service Provider (CSP) that the setting represents.

If there are no recommended device configuration settings to deploy, the Configurations section indicates that no recommended settings catalog policy configurations are available.

### Device configuration

#### Managed Installer support for user and device groups <!-- 30293237 -->

Our Managed Installer policy is updated to add the capability to target individual groups of users and devices, using one or more individual policies. Until now, a Managed Installer policy was a tenant-wide configuration that applied to all Windows devices. With this update, separate policies can now be assigned to different device groups providing you with more flexibility.

If you previously had a tenant-wide managed installer policy in effect, that policy remains available with a group assignment to all your devices. This reconfiguration is equivalent to the previous tenant-wide configuration it had before. You can choose to use that converted policy or implement new policies with more granular control.

For more information about configuring and using managed installers, see [Get started with managed installers](../protect/endpoint-security-app-control-policy.md#get-started-with-managed-installers).

### Device enrollment

#### Intune supports Ubuntu 22.04 and later<!-- 32756619 -->

Microsoft Intune and the Microsoft Intune app for Linux now support Ubuntu 22.04 LTS and Ubuntu 24.04 LTS. Support ended for Ubuntu 20.04 LTS. Devices that are currently enrolled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS remain enrolled even though the version is no longer supported. New devices are unable to enroll if they're running Ubuntu 20.04 LTS. To see what devices or users might be affected, check your Intune reporting. In the admin center, go to **Devices **> **All devices** and filter OS by Linux. You can add more columns to help identify who in your organization has devices running Ubuntu 20.04 LTS. Notify your users to upgrade their devices to a supported Ubuntu version.

For more information about Linux enrollment, see [Linux device enrollment guide for Microsoft Intune](deployment-guide-enrollment-linux.md).


### Device management

#### Wipe remote action supports Multi Admin Approval<!-- 27043113 -->

When you use the Multi Admin Approval feature, you require a second admin account to approve a change before the change is applied.

The **[Wipe](../remote-actions/device-wipe.md)** remote action supports Multi Admin Approval. Use Multi Admin Approval with the **Wipe** action to help mitigate the risk of unauthorized or compromised remote actions by a single admin account.

For more information on Multi Admin Approval, see [Use Multi Admin Approval in Intune](../fundamentals/multi-admin-approval.md).

#### Configure Windows Backup for Organizations (public preview)<!-- 33829628 -->

Intune administrators can configure a new feature in public preview called Windows Backup for Organizations. With this feature, you can back up your organization's Windows 10 or Windows 11 settings and restore them on a Microsoft Entra joined device. Backup settings are configurable in the Microsoft Intune admin center settings catalog, while a tenant-wide setting that lets you restore a device is available in the admin center under **Enrollment**. The backup setting is available now in public preview, while the restore setting will be available for public preview beginning August 26.

For more information about this feature, see [Windows Backup for Organizations in Microsoft Intune](../enrollment/windows-backup-restore.md).

#### New resolution button improves compliance remediation experience<!-- 31370959 -->

We improved the Just in Time (JIT) compliance remediation experience for device users in Microsoft Intune. Intune collaborated with Microsoft Defender to:

- Remove user clicks required to view and learn remediation steps.
- Add a **Resolve** button to reduce time-to-remediation.

When a user opens a productivity app and sees they're marked noncompliant due to Microsoft Defender, the user can now select **Resolve.** This action redirects them to Microsoft Defender, where Microsoft Defender takes steps to remediate the user and then redirect the user back to their productivity app.

Even if you aren't using Microsoft Defender, if you have Conditional Access turned on your users can have an improved experience. With JIT compliance remediation, users go through an embedded flow that shows them their compliance status, noncompliance reasoning, and a list of actions right within a productivity app. This flow eliminates extra steps, the need to switch between apps, and reduces the number of authentications.

As an admin, if you have JIT registration and compliance remediation set up already, you have no action items. If you don't, set it up today to support this new functionality. For more information, see:

- [Set up just-in-time registration](../enrollment/set-up-just-in-time-registration.md).
- [Update iOS device settings](../user-help/how-do-i-find-the-serial-number-on-my-device-ios.md).

### Monitor and troubleshoot

#### Declarative software update reports for Apple devices<!-- 25207078, 31557946 -->

You can now use several new [software update reports for Apple devices](../protect/updates/apple-reports.md) that are powered by Apples built-in declarative reporting infrastructure. The declarative reporting infrastructure provides Intune with a near real-time view of the software update status of managed devices. The following Apple software update reports are now available:

- A *per-device software update report* - Per-device software update reports are available in the Intune Admin center by going to *Devices* and then selecting an applicable device. In the Devices Overview pane for that device, below Monitor, you see the report listed as **iOS software updates** for iOS or iPadOS devices, and as **macOS software updates** for macOS devices.

  With these per-device reports available, the previously available macOS per-device **Software updates** report is now deprecated. While the deprecated report remains available in the admin center and can still be used while viewing a device, the report will be removed from Intune with a future update.

- **Apple software update failures** - With this operational report, you can view details across your entire managed Apple device fleet. Details include why the update failed to install and the timestamp of the last failure. To find this report, in the admin center go to *Devices* > *Monitor*, and then select the report's name to view the report details.

- **Apple software update report** - This report is an organizational report that displays details about pending and current software update information across your entire managed Apple device fleet. To find this report, in the admin center go to *Reports* > *Device management* > *Apple updates*, select the *Reports* tab, and then select the report tile.

- **Apple software update summary report** - View the Apple software update summary report, in the admin center go to *Reports* > *Device management* > *Apple updates*, and then select the *Summary* tab. You see a roll-up of update status from macOS, iOS, and iPadOS devices. This status includes the version of the latest update that's available for each platform, and the date that update became available.

The following Apple devices support these new reports:

- iOS 17 and later
- iPadOS 17 and later
- macOS 14 and later

For more information about the changes behind these reports, see [Support tip: Move to declarative device management for Apple software updates](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/IntuneCustomerSuccess/support-tip-move-to-declarative-device-management-for-apple-software-updates/4432177).

### Role-based access control

#### Multi Admin Approval support for role-based access control<!-- 26838684 -->

Multi Admin Approval now supports role-based access control. When enabled, any changes to roles, including modifications to role permissions, admin groups, or member group assignments, require a second administrator to approve the change before it's applied. This dual authorization process helps protect your organization from unauthorized or accidental role-based access control changes.

For more information, see [Role-based access control in Microsoft Intune](../fundamentals/role-based-access-control.md).

#### Update required for Microsoft Tunnel endpoints<!-- 32817331 -->

As part of our ongoing improvements to the Microsoft Tunnel infrastructure, we introduced new endpoints with the [March 19, 2025 release](../protect/microsoft-tunnel-upgrade.md#march-19-2025). You must upgrade your Microsoft Tunnel to the March 19, 2025 release version or later to ensure you're using the new endpoints. Once you upgrade to this version or later, you can't downgrade to an earlier version. Earlier releases that rely on legacy endpoints aren't supported and might cause service disruptions. To continue with uninterrupted service, we recommend upgrading to the latest supported build and avoiding rollback to unsupported versions.

## Week of July 28, 2025

### Device management

#### New Microsoft Graph permissions for API calls to device management endpoints<!-- 20952394 -->

Calls to several Microsoft Graph APIs now require one of two newer *DeviceManagement* permissions that replace the use of previously supported permissions. The following are the two new permissions and the original permissions that the new permissions replace:
- **DeviceManagementScripts.Read.All** - This new permission replaces use of *DeviceManagementConfiguration.Read.All*
- **DeviceManagementScripts.ReadWrite.All** - This new permission replaces use of the *DeviceManagementConfiguration.ReadWrite.All*

Access to the following Microsoft Graph API calls now require using the new permissions:

- ~/deviceManagement/deviceShellScripts
- ~/deviceManagement/deviceHealthScripts
- ~/deviceManagement/deviceComplianceScripts
- ~/deviceManagement/deviceCustomAttributeShellScripts
- ~/deviceManagement/deviceManagementScriptsâ€¯

Currently both the *DeviceManagementScripts* and the older *DeviceManagementConfiguration* permissions remain functional. However, in early September 2025, tools and scripts that rely on the older permissions to access the listed APIs fail to function.

For more information, see [How to use Microsoft Entra ID to access the Intune APIs in Microsoft Graph](../developer/Intune-graph-apis.md).

### Microsoft Intune Suite

#### Endpoint Privilege Management support for wildcards in elevation rules<!-- 30290730 -->

You can now use wildcards in the file name and file path of elevation rules you define for Endpoint Privilege Management (EPM). Wildcards allow for more flexible rule creation with broader matching capabilities, enabling file elevations for trusted files that have names that might change with subsequent revisions.

For file names, use of wildcards is supported only in the file name and not for the file extension. You can use a question mark `?` to replace a single character at any point in the file name and an asterisk `*` to replace a string of characters at the end of the file name.

The following are a few examples of wildcard use for a Visual Studio setup file called `VSCodeUserSetup-arm64-1.99.2.exe` found in `C:\Users\<username>\Downloads\`:

- File name:
  - `VSCodeUserSetup*.exe`
  - `VSCodeUserSetup-arm64-*.exe`
  - `VSCodeUserSetup-?????-1.??.?.exe`

- File path:

### Device security

#### macOS support for local administrator account configuration with password solution - GA <!-- 25385731 -->

macOS automated device enrollment (ADE) profiles can configure newly enrolled macOS devices that run macOS 12 or later with both a local administrator and local user account, along with support for the Microsoft Local Admin Password Solution (LAPS).

With this support:
- You can use macOS automated device enrollment (ADE) profiles to configure the local administrator and user accounts for a device. When configured, this capability applies to all new macOS device enrollments and device re-enrollments assigned to that enrollment profile.
- Intune creates a randomized, unique, and secure password for the device's admin account. It's 15 alphanumeric characters.
- Intune automatically rotates the password every six months by default.
- Previously enrolled devices aren't affected unless they re-enroll with Intune through an applicable ADE profile.

For account creation, the profile supports the following variables:

- **Admin account username**:
  - {{serialNumber}} - for example, F4KN99ZUG5V2
  - {{partialupn}} - for example, John.Dupont
  - {{managedDeviceName}} - for example, F2AL10ZUG4W2_14_4/15/2025_12:45PM
  - {{onPremisesSamAccountName}} - for example, JDoe

- **Admin account full name**:
  - {{username}} - for example, John@contoso.com
  - {{serialNumber}} - for example, F4KN99ZUG5V2
  - {{onPremisesSamAccountName}} - for example, JDoe

To support LAPS:
- There are two new role-based access control permissions for *Enrollment program* that can grant an administrative account permission to view a managed devices password, and to rotate that password.
- By default, these permissions aren't part of any built-in Intune RBAC role, and must be explicitly assigned to admins through custom roles.

To learn about all the details for this new capability, see [Configure support for macOS ADE local account configuration with LAPS in Microsoft Intune](../enrollment/macos-laps.md).

For more information about configuring settings catalog profiles in Intune, see [Create a policy using settings catalog](../configuration/settings-catalog.md).

There are new settings in the settings catalog. To see these settings, in the [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431), go to **Devices** > **Manage devices** > **Configuration** > **Create** > **New policy** > **iOS/iPadOS** or **macOS** for platform > **Settings catalog** for profile type.

##### iOS/iPadOS

**Managed Settings**:

- Idle Reboot Allowed

##### macOS

**Authentication > Extensible Single Sign On (SSO)**:

- Allow Device Identifiers In Attestation

**Microsoft Edge**:

- The Microsoft Edge category has hundreds of new settings. Learn more about available macOS Edge settings at [Microsoft Edge - Policies](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies).

Apple deprecated the Identification payload in macOS 15.4.

#### New Block Bluetooth setting in the Android Enterprise settings catalog<!-- 15583647 -->

The [Settings Catalog](../configuration/settings-catalog.md) lists all the settings you can configure in a device policy, and all in one place. For more information about configuring Settings Catalog profiles in Intune, see [Create a policy using settings catalog](../configuration/settings-catalog.md).

There's a new **Block Bluetooth** setting (**Devices** > **Manage devices** > **Configuration** > **Create** > **New policy** > **Android Enterprise** for platform > **Settings catalog** for profile type). When set to **True**, Bluetooth is disabled on the device.

There's also a **Block Bluetooth Configuration** setting that prevents end users from changing the Bluetooth setting on the device.

These settings are different and have different results. Some examples include:

- **Scenario**: An end user turned on the Bluetooth setting on their device. The admin creates an Intune policy that sets the **Block Bluetooth** setting to **True**.

  In this situation, Bluetooth is blocked on the device, even though the end user turned it on.

- **Scenario**: An end user turned on the Bluetooth setting on their device. The admin creates an Intune policy that sets the **Block Bluetooth Configuration** setting to **True**.

  In this situation, Bluetooth is turned on since the end user previously turned it on. The end user can't turn off Bluetooth. If the end user previously turned Bluetooth off, and then the **Block Bluetooth Configuration** policy applies, then Bluetooth is turned off and the end user can't turn it back on.

For a list of existing settings you can configure in the settings catalog, see [Android Enterprise device settings list in the Intune settings catalog](../configuration/settings-catalog-android.md).

### Device management

#### New reporting system for improved performance and data consistency <!-- 31823383, 33812267 -->

Microsoft Intune is rolling out the new Policy Reporting Service (PRS) V3. The new system brings faster report generation, improved reliability, and better data consistency.

In the first phase, some high-traffic compliance and device configuration reports are transitioning to the new system.

Users notice quicker updates in the Intune admin center and fewer issues with stale data. No action is required from users, as your reports transition automatically.

With (PRS) V3, device reports only update when a device checks in. This behavior is an intentional change from previous versions.

If a policy is removed but the device hasn't checked in, the report continues to show the last known status. The policy is removed during the next check-in, at which point the report is updated. This behavior improves accuracy but can differ from what customers experienced with (PRS) V1.

To learn more about the Intune reports you can use, see [Intune reports](reports.md).

### Device security

#### New attributes and S/MIME baseline requirements for SCEP certificate profiles <!-- 33116047 -->

Intune supports two new attributes for subject name settings in SCEP and PKCS device configuration profiles. They include:

- G={{GivenName}}
- SN={{SurName}}

Beginning July 16, if you're using a third party public certificate authority (CA) integrated with the Intune SCEP API for issuing S\MIME (encryption or signing) certificates anchored up to a public root CA, then you must use these attributes in the subject name format. After that date, a public CA won't issue or sign S\MIME certificates that omit these attributes.

For more information, see [S/MIME certificate requirements for third party public CA](../protect/certificates-profile-scep.md#smime-certificate-requirements-for-third-party-public-ca).

### App management

#### ARM64 support for Win32 apps<!-- 28475401 -->

When adding a Win32 app to Intune, you can select an option to check and install the app on Windows devices running ARM64 operating systems. This capability is available from the [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431) by selecting **Apps** > **All apps** > **Create**. The ARM64 option is available by selecting the **Operating system architecture** option under the **Requirements** step. To ensure that you don't have any impact to any Win32 applications that you previously targeted to 64-bit devices, your existing 64-bit Win32 applications also have ARM64 selected. After the availability of being able to specifically target ARM64 operating system architectures, selecting x64 won't target ARM64 devices.

For related information, see [Win32 app management in Microsoft Intune](../apps/apps-win32-app-management.md).

### Microsoft Intune Suite

#### Endpoint Privilege Management rules explicitly deny elevation<!-- 30225542 -->

Endpoint Privilege Management (EPM) elevation rules now include a new file elevation type of **Deny**. An EPM elevation rule set to *Deny* blocks the specified file from running in an elevated context. We recommend using file elevation rules to allow users to elevate specific files. But, a deny rule can help you ensure that certain files like known and potentially malicious software can't be run in an elevated context.

*Deny* rules support the same configuration options as other [elevation types](../protect/epm-elevation-rules.md#creating-elevation-rules-with-endpoint-privilege-management) except for child processes, which aren't used.

For more information about EPM, which is available as an [Intune Suite add-on-capability](../fundamentals/intune-add-ons.md), see [Endpoint Privilege Management overview](../protect/epm-overview.md).

#### New endpoint security profile for configuring Endpoint detection and response and Antivirus exclusion settings on Linux devices <!-- 26549863 -->

As part of the Intune scenario for [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint security settings management](../protect/mde-security-integration.md), you can use a new *Endpoint detection and response* profile for Linux named [**Microsoft Defender Global Exclusions (AV+EDR)**](../protect/endpoint-security-edr-policy.md#linux) that you can now use to manage Linux device exclusions for both Microsoft Defender *Endpoint detection and response* (EDR) and *Antivirus* (AV).

This profile supports settings related to global exclusion settings as detailed in [Configure and validate exclusions on Linux](/defender-endpoint/linux-exclusions) in the Microsoft Defender documentation. These exclusion configurations can apply to both the antivirus and EDR engines on the Linux client to stop associated real time protection EDR alerts for excluded items. Exclusions can be defined by the file path, folder, or process explicitly defined by the admin in the policy.

The new Intune profile:

- Is available in addition to the existing endpoint security Antivirus policy for Microsoft Defender Antivirus.
- Is supported for devices you manage through the [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint security settings management](../protect/mde-security-integration.md) scenario.
- Isn't supported for Linux devices managed directly by Intune.

For details about the available Defender settings, see [Configure security settings in Microsoft Defender for Endpoint on Linux - Microsoft Defender for Endpoint](/defender-endpoint/linux-preferences) in the Defender for Endpoint documentation.
