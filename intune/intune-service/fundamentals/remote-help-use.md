# Remote Help on Windows with Microsoft Intune

[!INCLUDE [intune-add-on-note](../includes/intune-add-on-note.md)]

[!INCLUDE [remote-help-overview](includes/remote-help-overview.md)]

## How to use Remote Help Windows

The use of Remote Help depends on whether you're requesting help or providing help. In this section, both scenarios are covered.

## Get help

To get help, you must reach out to your support staff to request assistance. You can reach out through a call, chat, email, and so on, and you'll be the sharer during the session.

### [:::image type="icon" source="../../media/icons/platforms/windows.svg"::: **Windows**](#tab/windows)

> [!NOTE]
> The Remote Help app will need to be installed on your device. If Remote Help wasn't installed by your administrator you can install Remote Help yourself by following the download instructions in the [Install and update Remote Help](remote-help-deploy.md#install-and-update-remote-help) section.

**Starting the session:**

1. The helper can initiate a session on your device from within the Microsoft Intune admin center and a notification is sent to your device or you can manually start the Remote Help app and enter a session code provided by the helper.
1. You'll be given the opportunity to verify the helper's identity by viewing their information including their full name, job title, company, profile picture, and verified domain. You can then choose to *Allow screen sharing or full control* or to *Decline the request*.
1. The session is established, and the helper can then help in resolving any issues on the device.

**During the session:**

- You can chat with the helper using the chat window in the Remote Help app.
- Helpers that have the *Elevation* permission can enter local admin permissions on your shared device. *Elevation* allows the helper to run executable programs or take similar actions when you lack sufficient permissions.
  > [!IMPORTANT]
  > During a Remote Help session, when a helper has the Elevationâ€¯permission, the helper will not automatically be able to view the sharer's UAC prompt. Instead, for a non-admin sharer, a button will appear on the helper's Remote Help toolbar that will allow them to request access to the UAC prompt on the sharer's device. Once requested and accepted, the helper will be able to perform elevated actions on the sharer's device. When the sharer ends the Remote Help session, they will be shown a dialog box that will warn them that if they continue, they will be logged off. If the helper ends the session, the sharer will not be logged off.
- The helper can request to move from screen sharing to full control if the session started with screen sharing only. You can choose to *Allow full control* or to *Decline the request*.

**When the issues are resolved or you're ready to end the session:**

- Both the sharer and helper can end the session. To end the session, select **Leave** in the upper right corner of the Remote Help app.

### [:::image type="icon" source="../../media/icons/platforms/macos.svg"::: **macOS**](#tab/macos)

This section covers the steps for using the macOS native app to request Remote Help.

> [!TIP]
> If you can't just want to share your screen and don't need the helper to be able to control your screen or you can't install the native app, you can use the web app. For more information on using the web app to request help, use the web app.

To request help, you must reach out to your support staff to request assistance, and enter a code they provide to start the session.

**Starting the session:**

1. Open Remote Help app on the device **Finder** > **Applications** > **Microsoft Remote Help**.

1. When the session connection begins, a trust screen is displayed with the Helpers information including their full name, job title, company, profile picture, and verified domain. At this time, the helper requests a session with Full control of your device or View Only screen sharing. You can either choose to *Allow* or to *Decline* the request.
1. You might see a prompt to allow `remotehelp.microsoft.com` to use your microphone.
   - Select **Don't Allow** as this permission isn't needed for screen sharing.

### [:::image type="icon" source="../../media/icons/platforms/android.svg"::: **Android**](#tab/android)

**Starting the session:**

1. On your device, you will see a prompt displaying a request to grant screen share or control of the device with the helpers information including their full name and company.
    a. If starting an attended screen sharing or full control session, you must select **Accept** to allow the session to begin. If you do not accept within 5 minutes, the session times out.
    b. If starting an unattended control session, the session will begin automatically after **30 seconds** if there is no response.

**During the session:**

- During an attended screen sharing or full control session, the device displays a floating **End Session** button. This button can be repositioned on the screen. Tap the button to end the session from your device.
- During an unattended control session, the screen of the device will blocked due to security and privacy reasons, and you will be notified if you interact with it. If you interact with the blocked screen, you will receive a notification that a helper is currently remotely accessing it for maintence. When the notification is shown, you and the helper will not be able to taken any action for 30 seconds when this screen will close. You will not be able to end the session from your device until the helper ends the session.

### [:::image type="icon" source="../media/icons/webapp.svg"::: **Web App**](#tab/webapp)

During a session there are two roles, a helper, and a sharer. The helper obtains the security code, and then provides it to the sharer. After the session is established, the helper can view the Sharer's screen.

**Starting the session:**

1. Navigate to https://aka.ms/rh and logs in with their organization's credentials.
1. Enter the code provided by the helper, and review and accept the prompts.

Remote Help displays a warning if the sharer's device isn't enrolled in Microsoft Intune. This warning doesn't block access but provides transparency about the risk of using sensitive data like administrative credentials during the session.

## Provide help

To provide help, you must reach out to the user who needs assistance. You can reach out through a call, chat, email, and so on, and you'll be the helper during the session.

### [Windows from Windows native app](#tab/windowsnative)

As a helper, after receiving a request from a user who wants assistance by using the Remote Help app:

1. Launch a session on the remote device from within the Microsoft Intune admin center:

   1. Sign into [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431) and go to **Devices** > **All devices** and select the device on which assistance is needed.

   2. From the remote actions bar across the top of the device view, select **New remote assistance session** and select **Remote Help**, and then **Continue**.

> [!NOTE]
> If you are launching the session from the Intune, login with the same credentials to the Remote Help app for a successful
> connection.

1. After the sharer opens the Remote Help app through the notification, as the helper you'll see information about the sharer, including their full name, job title, company, profile picture, and verified domain. The sharer sees similar information about you.

   At this time, you can request a session with full control of the sharer's device or choose only screen sharing. If you request full control, the sharer can choose to *Allow full control* or to *Decline the request*.

1. After establishing that the session uses a shared display or full control, Remote Help will display a **Compliance Warning* if the sharer's device fails to meet the conditions of its assigned compliance policies.

   During assistance, helpers that have the *Elevation* permission can enter local admin permissions on your shared device. *Elevation* allows the helper to run executable programs or take similar actions when you lack sufficient permissions.

> [!NOTE]
> When the `EnableSecureCredentialPrompting` policy is enabled, it blocks the elevation process during Remote Help sessions. To allow elevation, disable this policy.  [Learn more.](/windows/client-management/mdm/policy-csp-admx-credui#enablesecurecredentialprompting)

1. After the issues are resolved, or at any time during the session, both the sharer and helper can end the session. To end the session, select **Leave** in the upper right corner of the Remote Help app. If a helper performs elevated actions on a user's device and the sharer ends the session, at the end of the session the sharer is automatically signed out.
