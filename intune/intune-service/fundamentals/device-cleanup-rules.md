# Device cleanup rules

Managing a dynamic device fleet means constantly tracking devices that come and goâ€”due to upgrades, user turnover, or inactivity. Intune's device cleanup rules help keep the admin center clean by automatically hiding stale records.

Device cleanup rules in Intune run on a schedule and automatically hide records of devices that didn't check in for a specified period (for example, 90 days). These rules:

- Hide devices from the Intune portal and reports.
- **Don't trigger any actions on the device (no wipe or retire).**
- Allow cleaned-up devices to reappear if they check in before their device certificate expires.
- Require re-enrollment after the certificate expires.
- Aren't available for Jamf-managed devices.

## Requirements

[!INCLUDE [rbac-requirements](../../includes/h3/rbac-requirements.md)]

> [!div class="checklist"]
> To configure device cleanup rules, use an account with at least one of the following roles:
>
> - Intune Service Administrator
> - [Custom role][INT-RC] that includes:
>   - The permission **Managed Device Cleanup Rules/Update**
>   - The permission **Managed Device Cleanup Settings/Update**
>   - Permissions that provide visibility into and access to managed devices in Intune (for example, Organization/Read, Managed devices/Read)

## How to create a device cleanup rule

1. In the [Microsoft Intune admin center][INT-AC], select **Devices** > **Organize devices** > **Device cleanup rules**.
1. Select **Create**.
1. In **Basics**, enter the following properties:

    - **Name**: Enter a descriptive name for the rule.
    - **Description**: Enter a description for the rule. This setting is optional.
    - **Platform**: Select the platform that the rule applies to. The options are:
        - All platforms
        - Android (AOSP)
        - Android (fully managed/dedicated/corporate-owned work profile)
        - Android (device administrator)
        - Android (personally-owned work profile)
        - ChromeOS
        - iOS/iPadOS
        - macOS
        - Windows
        - Windows Holographic
        - visionOS
        - tvOS

    You can create one rule per platform. The rule applies to all devices in your organization with the platform you select.

1. Select **Next**.
1. In **Rule settings** > **Remove devices that haven't checked in for this many days**, enter a number between 30 and 270.

    This setting determines how many days a device must check in with the Intune service before the device is considered stale or inactive. If a device doesn't check in before the period ends, the device is cleaned up.

    > [!TIP]
    > Select **Preview affected devices** to get a list of devices that didn't check in during the specified number of days.

1. Select **Next**.
1. In **Review + create**, review your settings. When you select **Create**, your changes are saved, and the rule applies.

> [!NOTE]
> Devices hidden from Intune aren't removed from Microsoft Entra ID. For more information about removing devices from Microsoft Entra ID, see [Manage stale devices in Microsoft Entra ID](/entra/identity/devices/manage-stale-devices).

## Device cleanup rules logging

The [Intune audit logs](monitor-audit-logs.md) show the devices hidden by the device cleanup rules. In the logs, filter by **Activity name** > **Device set to be hidden from admin by Device Cleanup Rule [*Your Rule Name*]**.
