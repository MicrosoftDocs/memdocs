# In development for Microsoft Intune

To help in your readiness and planning, this article lists Intune UI updates and features that are in development but not yet released. Also:

- If we anticipate that you need to take action before a change, we'll publish a complementary post in the Office message center.
- When a feature enters production, whether it's in preview or generally available, the feature description moves from this article to [What's new](whats-new.md).
- Refer to the [Microsoft 365 roadmap](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?rtc=2&filters=EMS) for strategic deliverables and timelines.

This article and the [What's new](whats-new.md) article are updated periodically. Check back for more updates.

> [!NOTE]

## Microsoft Intune Suite

### Expanded support for Endpoint Privilege Management support approved elevation requests<!-- 33479618 -->

Soon Endpoint Privilege Management (EPM) will support the use of [support approved elevation requests](/intune/intune-service/protect/epm-support-approved) by all users of a device. Today, requesting elevation that requires support approval is limited to the device’s primary user or the user who enrolled the device. This update expands the utility of support approved elevations and helps to improve scenarios that involve shared devices.

<!-- ***********************************************-->

## App management

### Added protection for iOS/iPadOS app widgets<!-- 14614429 -->

To protect organizational data for MAM managed accounts and apps, Intune app protection policies will soon provide the capability to block data sync from policy managed app data to app widgets. App widgets can be added to end-user's iOS/iPadOS device lock screen, which can expose data contained by these widgets, such as meeting titles, top sites, and recent notes. In Intune, you'll be able to set the app protection policy setting **Sync policy managed app data with app widgets** to **Block** for iOS/iPadOS apps. This setting will be available as part of the **Data Protection** settings in app protection policies. This new setting will be an app protection feature similar to the **Sync policy managed app data with native app or add-ins** setting.

> Applies to:

> - iOS/iPadOS

<!-- *********************************************** -->

## Device configuration

### Recovery Lock settings catalog settings are available for macOS<!-- 32541429 -->

On macOS devices, you can configure a recovery OS password that prevents users from booting company-owned devices into recovery mode, reinstalling macOS, and bypassing remote management.

In a [settings catalog](../configuration/settings-catalog.md) policy, you can use the Recovery Lock settings to:

  - Set a recovery lock password
  - Configure a password rotation schedule
  - Clear a recovery lock password

> [!div class="checklist"]
> Applies to:
>
> - macOS

<!-- *********************************************** -->

## Device enrollment

### Configure Windows Backup for Organizations<!--29202026 -->
      
A new feature called *Windows Backup for Organizations* will soon be generally available in Microsoft Intune. With this feature, you can back up your organization's Windows settings and restore them on a Microsoft Entra joined device. Backup settings will be configurable in the Microsoft Intune admin center settings catalog, while a tenant-wide setting that lets you restore a device will be available in the admin center under **Enrollment**. For more information about this feature, see [Windows Backup for Organizations in Microsoft Intune](../enrollment/windows-backup-restore.md).  

### New Setup Assistant screens to be generally available for iOS/iPadOS and macOS automated device enrollment profiles <!-- 29832295, 29611787 -->

As an IT admin, you'll be able to hide or show 12 new Setup Assistant screens during automated device enrollment (ADE). The default is to show these screens during Setup Assistant.

The screens you can skip during iOS/iPadOS enrollment, and the applicable versions include:
- **App Store** (iOS/iPadOS 14.3+)
- **Camera button** (iOS/iPadOS 18+)
   - **Web content filtering** (iOS/iPadOS 18.2+)
   - **Safety and handling** (iOS/iPadOS 18.4+)
   - **Multitasking** (iOS/iPadOS 26+)
   - **OS Showcase** (iOS/iPadOS 26+)

The screens you can skip during macOS enrollment include:
- **App Store** (macOS 11.1+)
- **Get Started** (macOS 15+)
- **Software update** (macOS 15.4+)
- **Additional privacy settings** (macOS 26+)
- **OS Showcase** (macOS 26.1+)
- **Update completed** (macOS 26.1+)
- **Get Started** (macOS 15+)

## Device security

### Updated firewall configurations for new Intune network endpoints<!-- 34445623 -->

As part of Microsoft's ongoing [Secure Future Initiative (SFI)]( https://www.microsoft.com/trust-center/security/secure-future-initiative), network service endpoints for Microsoft Intune will be moving to new IP addresses. As a result, customers might need to update network (firewall) configurations in third-party applications to enable proper function of Intune device and app management. This change will affect customers using a firewall allowlist that allows outbound traffic based on IP addresses or Azure service tags.

### Security Baseline for audits of Security Technical Implementation Guides<!-- 31532934 -->

We're adding a new security baseline that audits devices against the recommended configuration of Security Technical Implementation Guides (STIGs). As a baseline focused on audits and not on configuration, this baseline focuses on Windows devices and generates detailed reports on which devices meet the recommended settings for compliance with STIGs.

> [!div class="checklist"]
> Applies to:
>
> - Windows

For information about the currently available Intune security baselines, see [Security baselines overview](../protect/security-baselines.md).

### Support for Intune Device control policy for devices managed by Microsoft Defender for Endpoint<!-- 15466620 -->

You'll be able to use the endpoint security policy for *Device control* (Attack surface reduction policy) from the Microsoft Intune with the devices you manage through the [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint security settings management](../protect/mde-security-integration.md) capability.

- **Device control** policies are part of endpoint security [Attack surface reduction policy](../protect/endpoint-security-asr-policy.md).

> [!div class="checklist"]
> Applies to the following when you use the *Windows* platform:
>
> - Windows 10
> - Windows 11

When this change takes effect, devices that are assigned this policy while managed by Defender for Endpoint but not enrolled with Intune, will now apply the settings from the policy. Check your policy to make sure only the devices you intend to receive this policy will get it.
