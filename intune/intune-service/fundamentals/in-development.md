# In development for Microsoft Intune

To help in your readiness and planning, this article lists Intune UI updates and features that are in development but not yet released. Also:

- If we anticipate that you need to take action before a change, we'll publish a complementary post in the Office message center.
- When a feature enters production, whether it's in preview or generally available, the feature description moves from this article to [What's new](whats-new.md).
- Refer to the [Microsoft 365 roadmap](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?rtc=2&filters=EMS) for strategic deliverables and timelines.

This article and the [What's new](whats-new.md) article are updated periodically. Check back for more updates.

> [!NOTE]

## Microsoft Intune Suite

### Expanded support for Endpoint Privilege Management support approved elevation requests<!-- 33479618 -->

Soon Endpoint Privilege Management (EPM) will support the use of [support approved elevation requests](/intune/intune-service/protect/epm-support-approved) by all users of a device. Today, requesting elevation that requires support approval is limited to the device’s primary user or the user who enrolled the device. This update expands the utility of support approved elevations and helps to improve scenarios that involve shared devices.

 <!-- ## App management -->

## Device configuration

### Recovery Lock settings catalog settings for macOS<!-- 32541429 -->

On macOS devices, you can configure a recovery OS password that prevents users from booting company-owned devices into recovery mode, reinstalling macOS, and bypassing remote management.

In a [settings catalog](../configuration/settings-catalog.md) policy, you can soon use the Recovery Lock settings to:

- Set a recovery lock password
- Configure a password rotation schedule
- Clear a recovery lock password

## Device security

### Security Baseline for audits of Security Technical Implementation Guides<!-- 31532934 -->

We're adding a new security baseline that audits devices against the recommended configuration of Security Technical Implementation Guides (STIGs). As a baseline focused on audits and not on configuration, this baseline focuses on Windows devices and generates detailed reports on which devices meet the recommended settings for compliance with STIGs.

> [!div class="checklist"]
> Applies to:
>
> - Windows

For information about the currently available Intune security baselines, see [Security baselines overview](../protect/security-baselines.md).

### Support for Intune Device control policy for devices managed by Microsoft Defender for Endpoint<!-- 15466620 -->

You'll be able to use the endpoint security policy for *Device control* (Attack surface reduction policy) from the Microsoft Intune with the devices you manage through the [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint security settings management](../protect/mde-security-integration.md) capability.

- **Device control** policies are part of endpoint security [Attack surface reduction policy](../protect/endpoint-security-asr-policy.md).

> [!div class="checklist"]
> Applies to the following when you use the *Windows* platform:
>
> - Windows 10
> - Windows 11

When this change takes effect, devices that are assigned this policy while managed by Defender for Endpoint but not enrolled with Intune, will now apply the settings from the policy. Check your policy to make sure only the devices you intend to receive this policy will get it.
