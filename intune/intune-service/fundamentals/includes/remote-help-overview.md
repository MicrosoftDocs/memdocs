Remote Help is a cloud-based solution for secure help desk connections with role-based access controls. With the connection, your support staff can remote connect to the user's device. For more information, see [Remote Help Overview](../remote-help.md). To start using Remote Help features, ensure you have met the [Prerequisites](../remote-help-plan.md#prerequisites).
