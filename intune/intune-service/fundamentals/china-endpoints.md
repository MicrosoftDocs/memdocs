# China endpoints for Microsoft Intune

This page lists the China endpoints needed for proxy settings in your Intune deployments.

To manage devices behind firewalls and proxy servers, you must enable communication for Intune.

- The proxy server must support both **HTTP (80)** and **HTTPS (443)** because Intune clients use both protocols
- For some tasks (like downloading software updates), Intune requires unauthenticated proxy server access to manage.microsoft.com

You can modify proxy server settings on individual client computers. You can also use Group Policy settings to change settings for all client computers located behind a specified proxy server.

Managed devices require configurations that let **All Users** access services through firewalls.

For more information about Windows 10 auto-enrollment and device registration for U.S. customers, see [Windows auto enrollment and device registration ](../enrollment/windows-enrollment-create-cname.md#windows-auto-enrollment-and-device-registration).  

The following tables list the ports and services that the Intune client accesses:

|**Endpoint**|**IP address**|
|---|---|
|*.manage.microsoftonline.cn | 40.73.38.143<br>139.217.97.81<br>52.130.80.24<br>40.73.41.162<br>40.73.58.153<br>139.217.95.85 <br> 143.64.196.128/25 <br> 40.162.2.128/25 <br> 139.219.250.128/25 <br> 163.228.221.128/25 <br>|
