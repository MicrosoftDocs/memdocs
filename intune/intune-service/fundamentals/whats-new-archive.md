<!-- Maintenance plan:

     Maintain ~2 years of archived content -->

## Week of September 23, 2024 (Service release 2409)

### App management

#### Working Time settings for app protection policies<!-- 14631539 -->

Working time settings allow you to enforce policies that limit access to apps and mute message notifications received from apps during non-working time. The limit access setting is now available for the Microsoft Teams and Microsoft Edge apps. You can limit access by using App Protection Policies (APP) to block or warn end users from using the iOS/iPadOS or Android Teams and Microsoft Edge apps during non-working time by setting the **Non-working time** conditional launch setting. Also, you can create a non-working time policy to mute notifications from the Teams app to end users during non-working time.

For more information, see:

- [Android app protection policy settings](../apps/app-protection-policy-settings-android.md#conditional-launch)
- [iOS app protection policy settings](../apps/app-protection-policy-settings-ios.md#conditional-launch)
- [Quiet time policies for iOS/iPadOS and Android apps](../apps/apps-quiet-time-policies.md#quiet-time-policy-types)

Applies to:

- Android
- iOS/iPadOS

#### Streamlined app creation experience for apps from Enterprise App Catalog<!-- 29411991 -->

We've streamlined the way apps from [Enterprise App Catalog](../apps/apps-add-enterprise-app.md) are added to Intune. We now provide a direct app link rather than duplicating the app binaries and metadata. App contents now download from a `*.manage.microsoft.com` subdomain. This update helps to improve the latency when adding an app to Intune. When you add an app from Enterprise App Catalog, it syncs immediately and is ready for additional action from within Intune.

#### Update Enterprise App Catalog apps<!-- 24875279 -->

Enterprise App Management is enhanced to allow you to update an **Enterprise App Catalog** app. This capability guides you through a wizard that allows you to add a new application and use supersedence to update the previous application.

For more information, see [Guided update supersedence for Enterprise App Management](../apps/apps-eam-supersedence.md).

### Device configuration

#### Samsung ended support for multiple Android device administrator (DA) settings <!-- 24990472 -->

On Android device administrator managed (DA) devices, Samsung has deprecated many [Samsung Knox APIs](https://docs.samsungknox.com/dev/knox-sdk/api-reference/deprecated-api-methods/) (opens Samsung's web site) configuration settings.

In Intune, this deprecation impacts the following device restrictions settings, compliance settings, and trusted certificate profiles:

- [Device restriction settings for Android in Microsoft Intune](../configuration/device-restrictions-android.md)
- [View the Android device administrator compliance settings for Microsoft Intune compliance policies](../protect/compliance-policy-create-android.md)
- [Create trusted certificate profiles in Microsoft Intune](../protect/certificates-trusted-root.md#trusted-certificate-profiles-for-android-device-administrator)

In the Intune admin center, when you create or update a profile with these settings, the impacted settings are noted.

Though the functionality might continue to work, there's no guarantee that it will continue working for any or all Android DA versions supported by Intune. For more information on Samsung support for deprecated APIs, see [What kind of support is offered after an API is deprecated?](https://docs.samsungknox.com/dev/knox-sdk/faqs/general/deprecated-api-support-change.htm) (opens Samsung's web site).

Instead, you can manage Android devices with Intune using one of the following Android Enterprise options:

- [Set up enrollment of Android Enterprise personally owned work profile devices](../enrollment/android-work-profile-enroll.md)
- [Set up Intune enrollment of Android Enterprise corporate-owned devices with work profile](../enrollment/android-corporate-owned-work-profile-enroll.md)
- [Set up enrollment for Android Enterprise fully managed devices](../enrollment/android-fully-managed-enroll.md)
- [Set up Intune enrollment of Android Enterprise dedicated devices](../enrollment/android-kiosk-enroll.md)
- [App protection policies overview](../apps/app-protection-policy.md)

Applies to:

- Android device administrator (DA)

#### Device Firmware Configuration Interface (DFCI) supports VAIO devices <!-- 28186944 -->

For Windows 10/11 devices, you can create a DFCI profile to manage UEFI (BIOS) settings. In [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431), select **Devices** > **Manage devices** > **Configuration** > **Create** > **New policy** > **Windows 10 and later** for platform > **Templates** > **Device Firmware Configuration Interface** for profile type.

Some VAIO devices running Windows 10/11 are enabled for DFCI. Contact your device vendor or device manufacturer for eligible devices.

#### Consent prompt update for remote log collection<!-- 28072852 -->

End users might see a different consent experience for remote log collection after the Android APP SDK 10.4.0 and iOS APP SDK 19.6.0 updates. End users no longer see a common prompt from Intune and only see a prompt from the application, if it has one.

Adoption of this change is per-application and is subject to each applications release schedule.

Applies to:

- Android
- iOS/iPadOS

### Device enrollment

#### New Setup Assistant screens available for configuration for ADE <!-- 26607203, 2532989 -->

New Setup Assistant screens are available to configure in the Microsoft Intune admin center. You can hide or show these screens during automated device enrollment (ADE).

For macOS:

- **Wallpaper**: Show or hide the macOS Sonoma wallpaper setup pane that appears after an upgrade on devices running macOS 14.1 and later.
- **Lockdown mode**: Show or hide the lockdown mode setup pane on devices running macOS 14.1 and later.
- **Intelligence**: Show or hide the Apple Intelligence setup pane on devices running macOS 15 and later.

For iOS/iPadOS:

- **Emergency SOS**: Show or hide the safety setup pane on devices running iOS/iPadOS 16 and later.
- **Action button**: Show or hide the setup pane for the action button on devices running iOS/iPadOS 17 and later.
- **Intelligence**: Show or hide the Apple Intelligence setup pane on devices running iOS/iPadOS 18 and later.

You can configure these screens in new and existing enrollment policies. For more information and additional resources, see:

- [Set up Apple automated device enrollment for iOS/iPadOS](../enrollment/device-enrollment-program-enroll-ios.md)
- [Set up Apple automated device enrollment for Macs](../enrollment/device-enrollment-program-enroll-macos.md)

#### Extended expiration date for corporate-owned, user-associated AOSP enrollment tokens<!-- 25782149 -->

Now when you create an enrollment token for Android Open Source Project (AOSP) corporate-owned, user-associated devices, you can select an expiration date that's up to 65 years into the future, an improvement over the previous 90 day expiration date. You can also modify the expiration date of existing enrollment tokens for Android Open Source Project (AOSP) corporate-owned, user-associated devices.

### Device security

#### New disk encryption template for Personal Data Encryption<!-- 28677934 -->

You can now use the new *Personal Data Encryption* (PDE) template that is available through endpoint security [*disk encryption* policy](../protect/encrypt-devices.md). This new template configures the Windows [PDE configuration service provider](/windows/client-management/mdm/personaldataencryption-csp) (CSP), which was introduced in Windows 11 22H2. The PDE CSP is also available through the settings catalog.

PDE differs from BitLocker in that it encrypts files instead of whole volumes and disks. PDE occurs in addition to other encryption methods such as BitLocker. Unlike BitLocker that releases data encryption keys at boot, PDE doesn't release data encryption keys until a user signs in using Windows Hello for Business.

Applies to:

- Windows 11 version 22h2 or later

For more information about PDE, including prerequisites, related requirements, and recommendations, see the following articles in the Windows security documentation:

- [PDE overview](/windows/security/operating-system-security/data-protection/personal-data-encryption/)
- [Configure PDE](/windows/security/operating-system-security/data-protection/personal-data-encryption/configure)
- [PDE frequently asked questions (FAQ)](/windows/security/operating-system-security/data-protection/personal-data-encryption/faq)

### Intune Apps

#### Newly available protected app for Intune<!-- 28730764 -->

The following protected app is now available for Microsoft Intune:

- Notate for Intune by Shafer Systems, LLC

For more information about protected apps, see [Microsoft Intune protected apps](../apps/apps-supported-intune-apps.md).

## Week of September 9, 2024

### App management

#### Managed Home Screen user experience update<!-- 28232751 -->

All Android devices automatically migrate to the updated Managed Home Screen (MHS) user experience. For more information, see [Updates to the Managed Home Screen experience](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/intune-customer-success/updates-to-the-managed-home-screen-experience/bc-p/3997842).

### Device enrollment

#### Support has ended for Apple profile-based user enrollment with Company Portal<!-- 28361917 -->

Apple supports two types of manual enrollment methods for users and devices in bring-your-own-device (BYOD) scenarios: *profile-based enrollment* and *account-driven enrollment*. Apple ended support for profile-based user enrollment, known in Intune as *user enrollment with Company Portal*. This method was their privacy-focused BYOD enrollment flow that used managed Apple IDs. As a result of this change, Intune has ended support for [profile-based user enrollment with Company Portal](../enrollment/apple-user-enrollment-with-company-portal.md). Users can no longer enroll devices targeted with this enrollment profile type. This change doesn't affect devices that are already enrolled with this profile type, so you can continue to manage them in the admin center and receive Microsoft Intune technical support. Less than 1% of Apple devices across all Intune tenants are currently enrolled this way, so this change doesn't affect most enrolled devices.

There's no change to profile-based device enrollment with Company Portal, the default enrollment method for BYOD scenarios. Devices enrolled via Apple automated device enrollment also remain unaffected.

We recommend account-driven user enrollment as a replacement method for devices. For more information about your BYOD enrollment options in Intune, see:

- [Account-driven user enrollment](../enrollment/apple-account-driven-user-enrollment.md)
- [Web-based device enrollment](../enrollment/web-based-device-enrollment-ios.md)
- [Device enrollment with Company Portal](../enrollment/ios-device-enrollment.md#app-or-web-based-enrollment) (default enrollment method for BYOD scenarios)

For more information about the device enrollment types supported by Apple, see [Intro to Apple device enrollment types](https://support.apple.com/en-mide/guide/deployment/dep08f54fcf6/web) in the Apple Platform Deployment guide.

### Device management

#### Intune now supports iOS/iPadOS 16.x as the minimum version<!-- 28391935 -->

Later this year, we expect iOS 18 and iPadOS 18 to be released by Apple. Microsoft Intune, including the Intune Company Portal and Intune app protection policies (APP, also known as MAM), will require iOS/iPadOS 16 and higher shortly after the iOS/iPadOS 18 release.

For more information on this change, see [Plan for change: Intune is moving to support iOS/iPadOS 16 and later](whats-new.md#plan-for-change-intune-is-moving-to-support-iosipados-16-and-later).

> [!NOTE]
> Userless iOS and iPadOS devices enrolled through Automated Device Enrollment (ADE) have a slightly nuanced support statement due to their shared usage. For more information, see [Support statement for supported versus allowed iOS/iPadOS versions for user-less devices](https://aka.ms/ADE_userless_support).

Applies to:

- iOS/iPadOS

#### Intune now supports macOS 13.x as the minimum version<!-- 28391869 -->

With Apple's release of macOS 15 Sequoia, Microsoft Intune, the Company Portal app, and the Intune MDM agent will now require macOS 13 (Ventura) and later.

For more information on this change, see [Plan for change: Intune is moving to support macOS 13 and later](whats-new.md#plan-for-change-intune-is-moving-to-support-macos-13-and-higher-later-this-year)

> [!NOTE]
> macOS devices enrolled through Automated Device Enrollment (ADE) have a slightly nuanced support statement due to their shared usage. For more information, see [Support statement](https://aka.ms/Intune/macOS/ADE-DE-support).

Applies to:

- macOS

## Week of August 19, 2024 (Service release 2408)

### Microsoft Intune Suite

#### Easy creation of Endpoint Privilege Management elevation rules from support approval requests and reports<!-- 28196775 -->

You can now create Endpoint Privilege Management (EPM) elevation rules directly from a support approved elevation request or from details found in the EPM Elevation report. With this new capability, you won’t need to manually identify specific file detection details for elevation rules. Instead, for files that appear in the Elevation report or a support approved elevation request, you can select that file to open its elevation detail pane, and then select the option to **Create a rule with these file details**.

When you use this option, you can then choose to add the new rule to one of your existing elevation policies, or create a new policy with only the new rule.

Applies to:

- Windows 10
- Windows 11

For information about this new capability, see [Windows elevation rules policy](../protect/epm-policies.md) in the *Configure policies for Endpoint Privilege management* article.

#### Introducing the Resource performance report for physical devices in Advanced Analytics<!-- 12659827 -->

We're introducing the Resource performance report for Windows physical devices in Intune Advanced Analytics. The report is included as an Intune-add on under Microsoft Intune Suite.

The resource performance scores and insights for physical devices are aimed to help IT admins make CPU/RAM asset management and purchase decisions that improve the user experience while balancing hardware costs.

For more information, see:

- [Resource Performance Report](../../analytics/resource-performance-report.md)
- [Microsoft Intune Suite](../fundamentals/intune-add-ons.md)

### App management

#### Managed Home Screen for Android Enterprise Fully Managed devices<!-- 15603355 -->

Managed Home Screen (MHS) is now supported on Android Enterprise Fully Managed devices. This capability offers organizations the ability to leverage MHS in scenarios where a device is associated with a single user.

For related information, see:

- [Configure the Microsoft Managed Home Screen app for Android Enterprise](../apps/app-configuration-managed-home-screen-app.md)
- [Android Enterprise device settings list to allow or restrict features on corporate-owned devices using Intune](../configuration/device-restrictions-android-for-work.md)
- [Configure permissions for the Managed Home Screen (MHS) on Android Enterprise devices using Microsoft Intune](../configuration/oemconfig-managed-home-screen-permissions-android.md)

#### Updates to the Discovered Apps report<!-- 28898418 -->

The **Discovered Apps** report, which provides a list of detected apps that are on Intune enrolled devices for your tenant, now provides publisher data for Win32 apps, in addition to Store apps. Rather than providing publisher information only in the exported report data, we're including it as a column in the **Discovered Apps** report.

For more information, see [Intune Discovered apps](../apps/app-discovered-apps.md#monitor-discovered-apps-with-intune).

#### Improvements to Intune Management Extension logs<!-- 26113668 -->

We have updated how log activities and events are made for Win32 apps and the Intune Management Extension (IME) logs. A new log file (*AppWorkload.log*) contains all logging information related to app deployment activities conducted by the IME. These improvements provide better troubleshooting and analysis of app management events on the client.

For more information, see [Intune management extension logs](../apps/intune-management-extension.md#intune-management-extension-logs).

### Device configuration

#### New settings available in the Apple settings catalog <!-- 28308531 -->

The [Settings Catalog](../configuration/settings-catalog.md) lists all the settings you can configure in a device policy, and all in one place. For more information about configuring Settings Catalog profiles in Intune, see [Create a policy using settings catalog](../configuration/settings-catalog.md).

There are new settings in the Apple Settings Catalog. To see these settings, in the [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431), go to **Devices** > **Manage devices** > **Configuration** > **Create** > **New policy** > **iOS/iPadOS** or **macOS** for platform > **Settings catalog** for profile type.

#### Enhancements to multi administrative approval<!-- 25174473 -->

Multi administrative approval adds the ability to limit application access policies to Windows applications or all non-Windows applications or both. We're adding a new access policy to the multiple administrative approval feature to allow approvals for changes to multiple administrative approval.

For more information, see [Multi admin approval](../fundamentals/multi-admin-approval.md).

### Device enrollment

#### Account-driven Apple User Enrollment now generally available for iOS/iPadOS 15+<!-- 10277062 -->

Intune now supports account-driven Apple User Enrollment, the new, and improved version of Apple User Enrollment, for devices running iOS/iPadOS 15 and later. This new enrollment method utilizes just-in-time registration, removing the Company Portal app for iOS as an enrollment requirement. Device users can initiate enrollment directly in the Settings app, resulting in a shorter and more efficient onboarding experience.

For more information, see [Set up account driven Apple User Enrollment](../enrollment/apple-account-driven-user-enrollment.md) on Microsoft Learn.

Apple announced they are ending support for profile-based Apple User Enrollment. As a result, Microsoft Intune will end support for Apple User Enrollment with Company Portal shortly after the release of iOS/iPadOS 18. We recommend enrolling devices with account-driven Apple User Enrollment for similar functionality and an improved user experience.

#### Use corporate Microsoft Entra account to enable Android Enterprise management options in Intune<!-- 25231452 -->

Managing Intune-enrolled devices with Android Enterprise management options previously required you to connect your Intune tenant to your managed Google Play account using an enterprise Gmail account. Now you can use a corporate Microsoft Entra account to establish the connection. This change is happening in new tenants, and doesn't affect tenants that have already established a connection.

For more information, see [Connect Intune account to Managed Google Play account - Microsoft Intune | Microsoft Learn](../enrollment/connect-intune-android-enterprise.md).

### Device management

#### 21Vianet support for Mobile Threat Defense connectors<!-- 10355489 -->

Intune operated by 21Vianet now supports Mobile Threat Defense (MTD) connectors for Android and iOS/iPadOS devices for MTD vendors that also have support in that environment. When an MTD partner is supported and you sign in to a 21Vianet tenant, the supported connectors are available.

Applies to:

- Android
- iOS/iPadOS

For more information, see:

- [Intune operated by 21Vianet in China](../fundamentals/china.md)
- [Mobile Threat Defense integration with Intune](../protect/mobile-threat-defense.md)

#### New `cpuArchitecture` filter device property for app and policy assignments<!-- 7423106 -->

When you assign an app, compliance policy, or configuration profile, you can filter the assignment using different device properties, such as device manufacturer, operating system SKU, and more.

A new `cpuArchitecture` device filter property is available for Windows and macOS devices. With this property, you can filter app and policy assignments depending on the processor architecture.

For more information on filters and the device properties you can use, see:

- [Use filters when assigning your apps, policies, and profiles in Microsoft Intune](filters.md)
- [Filter properties](filters-device-properties.md)

Applies to:

- Windows 10
- Windows 11
- macOS

### Device security

#### Windows platform name change for endpoint security policies<!-- 16104088 -->

When you create an endpoint security policy in Intune, you can select the Windows platform. For multiple templates in endpoint security, there are now only two options to choose for the Windows platform: **Windows** and **Windows (ConfigMgr)**.

Specifically, the platform name changes are:

| Original | New |
| --- | --- |
| Windows 10 and later​ | Windows |
| Windows 10 and later (ConfigMgr)​ | Windows (ConfigMgr)​ |
| Windows 10, Windows 11, and Windows Server | Windows |
| Windows 10, Windows 11, and Windows Server​ (ConfigMgr) | Windows (ConfigMgr)​ |

These changes apply to the following policies:

- Antivirus
- Disk encryption
- Firewall
- Endpoint Privilege Management
- Endpoint detection and response
- Attack surface reduction
- Account protection

##### What you need to know

- This change is only in the user experience (UX) that admins see when they create a new policy. There is no effect on devices.
- The functionally is the same as the previous platform names.
- There are no additional tasks or actions for existing policies.

For more information on endpoint security features in Intune, see [Manage endpoint security in Microsoft Intune](../protect/endpoint-security.md).

Applies to:

- Windows

#### Target Date Time setting for Apple software update enforcement schedules updates using the local time on devices <!-- 28865232 -->

You can specify the time that OS updates are enforced on devices in their local time zone. For example, configuring an OS update to be enforced at 5pm schedules the update for 5pm in the device's local time zone. Previously, this setting used the time zone of the browser where the policy was configured.

This change only applies to new policies that are created in the August 2408 release and later. The **Target Date Time** setting is in the [settings catalog](../configuration/settings-catalog.md) at **Devices** > **Manage devices** > **Configuration** > **Create** > **New policy** > **iOS/iPadOS** or **macOS** for platform > **Settings catalog** for profile type > **Declarative Device Management** > Software Update.

In a future release, the **UTC** text will be removed from the **Target Date Time** setting.

For more information on using the settings catalog to configure software updates, see [Managed software updates with the settings catalog](../protect/managed-software-updates-ios-macos.md).

Applies to:

- iOS/iPadOS
- macOS

### Intune Apps

### Tenant administration

#### Organizational messages now in Microsoft 365 admin center<!-- 27711197 -->

The organizational message feature has moved out of the Microsoft Intune admin center and into its new home in the Microsoft 365 admin center. All organizational messages you created in Microsoft Intune are now in the Microsoft 365 admin center, where you can continue to view and manage them. The new experience includes highly requested features such as the ability to author custom messages, and deliver messages on Microsoft 365 apps.

For more information, see:

- [Introducing organizational messages (preview) in the Microsoft 365 admin center](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-365-blog/introducing-organizational-messages-preview-in-the-microsoft-365/ba-p/4123890)

## Week of July 29, 2024

### Microsoft Intune Suite

#### Endpoint Privilege Management, Advanced Analytics, and Intune Plan 2 are available for GCC High and DoD<!-- 25230811, 25300700, 27030977, 27234960 -->

We are excited to announce that the following capabilities from the Microsoft Intune Suite are now supported in U.S. Government Community Cloud (GCC) High and U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) environments.

Add-on capabilities:

- [Endpoint Privilege Management](../protect/epm-overview.md)
- [Advanced Analytics](../../analytics/advanced-endpoint-analytics.md) - With this release, GCC High and DoD support for Advanced Endpoint Analytics doesn't include the [*Device query*](../../analytics/device-query.md) functionality.

Plan 2 capabilities:

- [Microsoft Tunnel for Mobile Application Management](../protect/microsoft-tunnel-mam.md)
- [Firmware-over-the-air update](../protect/zebra-lifeguard-ota-integration.md)
- [Specialty devices management](../fundamentals/specialty-devices-with-intune.md)

For more information, see:

- [Use Microsoft Intune Suite add-on capabilities](../fundamentals/intune-add-ons.md)
- [Microsoft Intune for US Government GCC service description](../fundamentals/intune-govt-service-description.md)

### Device enrollment

#### ACME protocol support for iOS/iPadOS and macOS enrollment<!-- 25140355 -->

As we prepare to support managed device attestation in Intune, we are starting a phased rollout of an infrastructure change for new enrollments that includes support for the *Automated Certificate Management Environment (ACME) protocol*. Now when new Apple devices enroll, the management profile from Intune receives an ACME certificate instead of a SCEP certificate. ACME provides better protection than SCEP against unauthorized certificate issuance through robust validation mechanisms and automated processes, which helps reduce errors in certificate management.

Existing OS and hardware eligible devices do not get the ACME certificate unless they re-enroll. There is no change to the end user's enrollment experience, and no changes to the Microsoft Intune admin center. This change only impacts enrollment certificates and has no impact on any device configuration policies.

ACME is supported for Apple Device Enrollment, Apple Configurator enrollment, and Automated device enrollment (ADE) methods. Eligible OS versions include:

- iOS 16.0 or later
- iPadOS 16.1 or later
- macOS 13.1 or later

This capability is also supported in [GCC High tenants](../fundamentals/intune-govt-service-description.md).

## Week of July 22, 2024 (Service release 2407)

### Device enrollment

#### Update for Apple user and device enrollments with Company Portal <!-- 27557088 -->

We've made changes to the device registration process for Apple devices enrolling with Intune Company Portal. Previously, Microsoft Entra device registration occurred during enrollment. With this change, registration occurs after enrollment.

Existing enrolled devices aren't affected by this change. For new user or device enrollments that utilize Company Portal, users must return to Company Portal to complete registration:

- For iOS users: Users with notifications enabled are prompted to return to the Company Portal app for iOS. If they disable notifications, they aren't alerted, but still need to return to Company Portal to complete registration.

- For macOS devices: The Company Portal app for macOS detects the installation of the management profile and automatically register the device, unless the user closes the app. If they close the app, they must reopen it to complete registration.

If you're using dynamic groups, which rely on device registration to work, it's important for users to complete device registration. Update your user guidance and admin documentation as needed. If you're using Conditional Access (CA) policies, no action is required. When users attempt to sign in to a CA-protected app, they are prompted to return to Company Portal to complete registration.

These changes are currently rolling out and will be made available to all Microsoft Intune tenants by the end of July. There's no change to the Company Portal user interface. For more information about device enrollment for Apple devices, see:

- [Enrollment guide: Enroll macOS devices in Microsoft Intune](../fundamentals/deployment-guide-enrollment-macos.md#device-enrollment-end-user-tasks)

### Role-based access control

#### New granular RBAC controls for Intune endpoint security<!-- 5475572 -->

We’ve begun to replace the role-based access control (RBAC) rights to endpoint security policies that are granted by the *Security baselines* permission with a series of more granular permissions for specific endpoint security tasks. This change can help you assign the specific rights your Intune admins require to do specific jobs instead of relying on either the [built-in](../fundamentals/role-based-access-control.md#built-in-roles) *Endpoint Security Manager* role or a [custom role](../fundamentals/create-custom-role.md) that includes the *Security baseline* permission. Prior to this change, the *Security baseline* permission grants rights across all endpoint security policies.

The following new RBAC permissions are available for endpoint security workloads:

- App Control for Business
- Attack surface reduction
- Endpoint detection and response

Each new permission supports the following rights for the related policy:

- Assign
- Create
- Delete
- Read
- Update
- View Reports

Each time we add a new granular permission for an endpoint security policy to Intune, those same rights are removed from the *Security baselines* permission. If you use custom roles with the *Security baselines* permission, the new RBAC permission is assigned automatically to your custom roles with the same rights that were granted through the *Security baseline* permission. This autoassignment ensures your admins continue to have the same permissions they have today.

For more information about current RBAC permissions and built-in roles, see:

- [Role-based access control (RBAC) with Microsoft Intune](../fundamentals/role-based-access-control.md)
- [Built-in role permissions for Microsoft Intune](../fundamentals/role-based-access-control-reference.md)
- [Assign role-based access controls for endpoint security policy](../protect/endpoint-security-policy.md#assign-role-based-access-controls-for-endpoint-security-policy) in *Manage device security with endpoint security policies in Microsoft Intune*.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> With this release, the granular permission of **Antivirus** for endpoint security policies might be temporarily visible in some Tenants. This permission is not released and isn't supported for use. Configurations of the *Antivirus* permission are ignored by Intune. When *Antivirus* becomes available to use as a granular permission, it's availability will be announced in this [What's new in Microsoft Intune](../fundamentals/whats-new.md) article.

## Week of June 3, 2024

### Device enrollment

#### New enrollment time grouping feature for devices <!-- 16902437 -->

Enrollment time grouping is a new, faster way to group devices during enrollment. When configured, Intune adds devices to the appropriate group without requiring inventory discovery and dynamic membership evaluations. To set up enrollment time grouping, you must configure a static Microsoft Entra security group in each enrollment profile. After a device enrolls, Intune adds it to the static security group and delivers assigned apps and policies.

This feature is available for Windows 11 devices enrolling via Windows Autopilot device preparation. For more information, see [Enrollment time grouping in Microsoft Intune](../enrollment/enrollment-time-grouping.md).

## Week of May 27, 2024

### Device security

#### Windows Firewall CSP changes for processing Firewall Rules<!-- 10734904 -->

Windows changed how the Firewall configuration service provider (CSP) enforces rules from Atomic blocks of firewall rules. The Windows Firewall CSP on a device implements the firewall rule settings from your [Intune endpoint security Firewall policies](../protect/endpoint-security-firewall-policy.md). The change of CSP behavior now enforces an all-or-nothing application of firewall rules from each Atomic block of rules.

- Previously, the CSP on a device would go through the firewall rules in an Atomic block of rules - one rule (or setting) at a time with the goal of applying all the rules in that Atomic block, or none of them. If the CSP encountered any issue with applying any rule from the block to the device, the CSP wouldn't only stop that rule, but also cease to process subsequent rules without trying to apply them. However, rules that applied successfully before a rule failed, would remain applied to the device. This behavior can lead to a partial deployment of firewall rules on a device, since the rules that were applied before a rule failed to apply aren't reversed.

- With the change to the Firewall CSP, when any rule in the block is unsuccessful in applying to the device, all the rules from that same Atomic block that were applied successfully are rolled back. This behavior ensures the desired all-or-nothing behavior is implemented and prevents a partial deployment of firewall rules from that block. For example, if a device receives an Atomic block of firewall rules that has a misconfigured rule that can't apply, or has a rule that isn't compatible with the devices operating system, then the CSP fails all the rules from that block, And, it rolls back any rules that applied to that device.

This change of Firewall CSP behavior is available on devices that run the following Windows versions or later:

- Windows 11 21H2
- Windows 11 22H2
- Windows 10 21H2

For more information on the subject of how the Windows Firewall CSP uses Atomic blocks to contain firewall rules, see the note near the top of [Firewall CSP](/windows/client-management/mdm/firewall-csp) in the Windows documentation.

For troubleshooting guidance, see the Intune support blog [How to trace and troubleshoot the Intune Endpoint Security Firewall rule creation process](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/intune-customer-success/how-to-trace-and-troubleshoot-the-intune-endpoint-security/ba-p/3261452).

#### CrowdStrike – New mobile threat defense partner<!-- 16882021 -->

Copilot in Intune is integrated in the Intune admin center, and can help you get information quickly. You can use Copilot in Intune for the following tasks:

✅ **Copilot can help you manage your settings and policies**

- **Copilot tooltip on settings**: When you add settings to a policy or review settings in an existing policy, there's a new Copilot tooltip. When you select the tooltip, you get AI generated guidance based on Microsoft content and recommendations. You can see what each setting does, how the setting works, any recommended values, if the setting is configured in another policy, and more.

- **Policy summarizer**: On existing policies, you get a Copilot summary of the policy. The summary describes what the policy does, the users and groups assigned to the policy, and the settings in the policy. This feature can help you understand the impact of a policy and its settings on your users and devices.

✅ **Copilot shows device details and can help troubleshoot**

- **All about a device**: On a device, you can use Copilot to get key information about the device, including its properties, configuration, and status information.

- **Device compare**: Use Copilot to compare the hardware properties and device configurations of two devices. This feature helps you determine what's different between two devices with similar configurations, especially when troubleshooting.

- **Error code analyzer**: Use Copilot in the device view to analyze an error code. This feature helps you understand what the error means and provides a potential resolution.

✅ **Intune capabilities in Copilot for Security**

Intune has capabilities available in the Copilot for Security portal. SOC Analysts and IT admins can use these capabilities to get more information on policies, devices, group membership, and more. On a single device, you can get more specific information that's unique to Intune, like compliance status, device type, and more.

You can also ask Copilot to tell you about a user's devices and get a quick summary of critical information. For example, the output shows links to the user's devices in Intune, device ID, enrollment date, last check-in date, and compliance status. If you're an IT admin and reviewing a user, then this data provides a quick summary.

As a SOC analyst that's investigating a suspicious or potentially compromised user or device, information like enrollment date and last check-in can help you make informed decisions.

### Microsoft Intune Suite

#### New elevation type for Endpoint Privilege Management<!-- 25230692 -->

Endpoint Privilege Management has a new file elevation type, **support approved**. Endpoint Privilege Management is a feature component of the Microsoft Intune Suite and is also available as a standalone [Intune add-on](../fundamentals/intune-add-ons.md).

A support-approved elevation gives you a third option for both the default elevation response and the elevation type for each rule. Unlike automatic or user confirmed, a support-approved elevation request requires Intune administrators to manage which files can run as elevated on a case-by-case basis.

With support approved elevations, users can request approval to elevate an application that isn't explicitly allowed for elevation by automatic or user approved rules. This takes the form of an elevation request that must be reviewed by an Intune administrator who can approve or deny the elevation request.

When the request is approved, users are notified that the application can now be run as elevated, and they have 24 hours from the time of approval to do so before the elevation approval expires.

Applies to:

- Windows 10
- Windows 11

For more information on this new capability, see [Support approved elevation requests](../protect/epm-support-approved.md).

### Device management

#### New compliance setting lets you verify device integrity using hardware-backed security features<!-- 12391862 -->

A new compliance setting called **Check strong integrity using hardware-backed security features** lets you verify device integrity using hardware-backed key attestation. If you configure this setting, strong integrity attestation is added to Google Play's integrity verdict evaluation. Devices must meet device integrity to remain compliant. Microsoft Intune marks devices that don't support this type of integrity check as noncompliant.

This setting is available in profiles for Android Enterprise fully managed, dedicated, and corporate-owned work profile, under **Device Health** > **Google Play Protect**. It only becomes available when the Play integrity verdict policy in your profile is set to **Check basic integrity** or **Check basic integrity & device integrity**.

Applies to:

- Android Enterprise

For more information, see [Device compliance - Google Play Protect](../protect/compliance-policy-create-android-for-work.md#google-play-protect).

#### New compliance settings for Android work profile, personal devices<!-- 24743927 -->

- Minimum password length

If a work profile password fails to meet requirements, Company Portal marks the device as noncompliant. Intune compliance settings take precedence over the respective settings in an Intune device configuration profile. For example, the password complexity in your compliance profile is set to *medium*. The password complexity in a device configuration profile is set to *high*. Intune prioritizes and enforces the compliance policy.

Applies to:

- Android Enterprise personally owned devices with a work profile

For more information, see [Compliance settings - Android Enterprise](../protect/compliance-policy-create-android-for-work.md#personally-owned-work-profile).

#### Windows quality updates support for expediting non-security updates<!-- 17614146 -->

Windows quality updates now support expediting non-security updates for those times when a quality fix needs to be deployed faster than the normal quality update settings.

Applies to:

- Windows 11 devices

For more information about installing an expedited update, see [Expedite Windows quality updates in Microsoft Intune](../protect/windows-10-expedite-updates.md#create-and-assign-an-expedited-quality-update).

#### Introducing a remote action to pause the config refresh enforcement interval<!--24249019 -->

In the Windows Settings Catalog, you can configure **Configuration Refresh**. This feature lets you set a cadence for Windows devices to reapply previously received policy settings, without requiring devices to check in to Intune. The device will replay and re-enforce settings based on previously received policy to minimize the chance for configuration drift.

To support this feature, a remote action is added to allow a pause in action. If an admin needs to make changes or run remediation on a device for troubleshooting or maintenance, they can issue a pause from Intune for a specified period. When the period expires, settings are enforced again.

The remote action **Pause configuration refresh** can be accessed from the device summary page.

For more information, see:

- [Remote actions](../remote-actions/device-management.md)
- [Pause Config Refresh Remote action](../remote-actions/pause-config-refresh.md)

### Device security

#### Updated security baseline for Windows version 23H2<!-- 25021947 -->

You can now deploy the Intune security baseline for Windows version 23H2. This new baseline is based on the **version 23H2** of the Group Policy security baseline found in the [Security Compliance Toolkit and Baselines](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=55319) from the Microsoft Download Center, and includes only the settings that are applicable to devices managed through Intune. Use of this updated baseline can help you maintain best-practice configurations for your Windows devices.

This baseline uses the unified settings platform seen in the Settings Catalog. It features an improved user interface and reporting experience, consistency and accuracy improvements related to setting tattooing, and can support assignment filters for profiles.

Use of [Intune security baselines](../protect/security-baselines.md) can help you rapidly deploy configurations to your Windows devices that meet the security recommendations of the applicable security teams at Microsoft. As with all baselines, the default baseline represents the recommended configurations, which you can modify to meet the requirements of your organization.

Applies to:

- Windows 10
- Windows 11

To view the new baselines included settings with their default configurations, see, [Windows MDM security baseline version 23H2](../protect/security-baseline-settings-mdm-all.md?pivots=mdm-23h2).

#### Use a rootless implementation of Podman to host Microsoft Tunnel<!-- 24836716 -->

When prerequisites are met, you can use a rootless Podman container to host a Microsoft Tunnel server. This capability is available when you use [Podman for Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL)](../protect/microsoft-tunnel-prerequisites.md#linux-server) version 8.8 or later, to host Microsoft Tunnel.

When using a rootless Podman container, the mstunnel services run under a non-privileged service user. This implementation can help limit impact from a container escape. To use a rootless Podman container, you must start the tunnel installation script using a modified command line.

For more information about this Microsoft Tunnel install option, see [Use a rootless Podman container](../protect/microsoft-tunnel-configure.md#use-a-rootless-podman-container).

#### New setting for updating MAC address randomization on Android Enterprise devices<!-- 24259789 -->

There's a new **MAC address randomization** setting on Android Enterprise devices (**Devices** > **Manage devices** > **Configuration** > **Create** > **New policy** > **Android Enterprise** for platform > **Fully Managed, Dedicated, and Corporate-Owned Work Profile** > **Wi-Fi** for profile type).

Starting with Android 10, when connecting to a network, devices present a randomized MAC address instead of the physical MAC address. Using randomized MAC addresses is recommended for privacy, as it's harder to track a device by its MAC address. However, randomized MAC addresses break functionality that relies on a static MAC address, including network access control (NAC).

Your options:

- **Use device default**: Intune doesn't change or update this setting. By default, when connecting to a network, devices present a randomized MAC address instead of the physical MAC address. Any updates made by the user to the setting persist.

- **Use randomized MAC**: Enables MAC address randomization on devices. When devices connect to a new network, devices present a randomized MAC address, instead of the physical MAC address. If the user changes this value on their device, it resets to **Use randomized MAC** on the next Intune sync.

- **Use device MAC**: Forces devices to present their actual Wi-Fi MAC address instead of a random MAC address. This setting allows devices to be tracked by their MAC address. Only use this value when necessary, such as for network access control (NAC) support. If the user changes this value on their device, it resets to **Use device MAC** on the next Intune sync.

Applies to:

- Android 13 and newer

For more information on the Wi-Fi settings you can configure, see [Add Wi-Fi settings for Android Enterprise dedicated and fully managed devices in Microsoft Intune](../configuration/wi-fi-settings-android-enterprise.md).

#### Windows Autopilot self-deploying mode is now generally available<!-- 26780755 -->

Windows Autopilot self-deploying mode is now generally available and out of preview. Windows Autopilot self-deploying mode enables you to deploy Windows devices with little to no user interaction. Once the device connects to network, the device provisioning process starts automatically: the device joins Microsoft Entra ID, enrolls in Intune, and syncs all device-based configurations targeted to the device. Self-deploying mode ensures that the user can't access desktop until all device-based configuration is applied. The Enrollment Status Page (ESP) is displayed during OOBE so users can track the status of the deployment. For more information, see:

- [Windows Autopilot self-deploying mode](/autopilot/self-deploying)
- [Step by step tutorial for Windows Autopilot self-deploying mode in Intune](/autopilot/tutorial/self-deploying/self-deploying-workflow)

#### Windows Autopilot for pre-provisioned deployment is now generally available<!-- 26780755 -->

Windows Autopilot for pre-provisioned deployment is now generally available and out of preview. Windows Autopilot for pre-provisioned deployment is used by organizations that want to ensure devices are business-ready before the user accesses them. With pre-provisioning, admins, partners, or OEMs can access a technician flow from the Out-of-box experience (OOBE) and kick off device setup. Next, the device is sent to the user who completes provisioning in the user phase. Pre-provisioning delivers most the configuration in advance so the end user can get to the desktop faster. For more information, see:

- [Windows Autopilot for pre-provisioned deployment](/autopilot/pre-provision).

With this change, Intune supports BlackBerry Protect Mobile for mobile application management (MAM) scenarios for [unenrolled devices](../protect/mtd-add-apps-unenrolled-devices.md). This support includes the use of risk assessment with Conditional Access and configuration of Conditional Launch settings for unenrolled devices.

While configuring the CylancePROTECT Mobile connector (formerly BlackBerry Mobile), you now can select options to turn on *App protection policy evaluation* for both Android and iOS/iPadOS devices.

For more information, see [Set up BlackBerry Protect Mobile](../protect/blackberry-mobile-threat-defense-connector.md), and [Create Mobile Threat Defense app protection policy with Intune](../protect/mtd-app-protection-policy.md).

### Device security

#### Support for Intune Defender Update control policies for devices managed by Microsoft Defender for Endpoint<!--25470154 -->

You can now use the endpoint security policy for *Defender Update control* (Antivirus policy) from the Microsoft Intune admin center with the devices you manage through the [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint security settings management](../protect/mde-security-integration.md) capability.

- **Defender Update control** policies are part of endpoint security [Antivirus policy](../protect/endpoint-security-antivirus-policy.md).

Applies to the following when you use the *Windows 10, Windows 11, and Windows Server* platform:

- Windows 10
- Windows 11

With this support available, devices that are assigned this policy while managed by Defender for Endpoint but not enrolled with Intune, will now apply the settings from the policy. Check your policy to make sure only the devices you intend to receive the policy will get it.

### Intune apps

#### Newly available protected apps for Intune<!-- 25765585, 26137219 -->

The following protected apps are now available for Microsoft Intune:

- PrinterOn Print by PrinterOn, Inc. (iOS/iPadOS)
- Align for Intune by MFB Technologies, Inc. (iOS/iPadOS)

For more information about protected apps, see [Microsoft Intune protected apps](../apps/apps-supported-intune-apps.md).

### Monitor and troubleshoot

#### Monitoring reports for devices<!-- 17744651 -->

In Intune, you can view a new list of all device monitoring reports. You can find these reports in [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431) by selecting **Devices** > **Monitor**. The **Monitor** pane provides reports related to configuration, compliance, enrollment, and software updates. Additionally, there are other reports that you can view, such as **Device actions**.

For more information, see [Intune reports](reports.md).

#### Exported report data maintains search results<!-- 17723620 -->

Intune can now maintain your report search and filter results when exporting report data. For example, when you use the [Noncompliant devices and settings](reports.md#noncompliant-devices-report-organizational) report, set the OS filter to "Windows", and search for "PC", the exported data will only contain Windows devices with "PC" in their name. This capability is also available when calling the `ExportJobs` API directly.

#### Easy upload of diagnostic logs for Microsoft Tunnel servers<!-- 15728481 -->

You can now use a single click within the Intune admin center to have Intune enable, collect, and submit eight hours of verbose logs for a Tunnel Gateway Server to Microsoft. The verbose logs can then be referenced while working with Microsoft to identify or resolve issues with a Tunnel server.

In contrast, the collection of verbose logs previously required you to sign on to the server, run manual tasks and scripts to enable and collect verbose logs, and then copy them to a location from which you can transfer them to Microsoft.

To find this new capability, in the admin center go to **Tenant administration** > **Microsoft Tunnel Gateway** > select a server > select the **Logs** tab. On this tab, is a new section named **Send verbose server logs** with button labeled **Send logs**, and a list view that displays the various log sets that have been collected and submitted to Microsoft.

When you select the **Send logs** button:

- Intune captures and submits the current server logs as a baseline, prior to collecting verbose logs.
- Verbose logging is automatically enabled at level 4, and runs for eight hours to provide time to reproduce an issue for capture in those logs.
- After eight hours, Intune submits the verbose logs and then restores the server to its default verbosity level of zero (0), for normal operations. If you previously set logs to run at a higher verbosity level, you can restore your custom verbosity level after log collection and upload is complete.
- Each time Intune collects and submits logs, it updates the list view below the button.
- Below the button is a list of past log submissions, displaying their verbosity level and an Incident ID that you can use when working with Microsoft to reference a specific set of logs.

For more information about this capability, see [Easy upload of diagnostic logs for Tunnel servers](../protect/microsoft-tunnel-monitor.md#easy-upload-of-diagnostic-logs-for-tunnel-servers).

### Device security

#### New settings for scheduling Antivirus scans added to Antivirus policy for Windows devices<!-- 26013546  -->

We added two settings to the *Microsoft Defender Antivirus* profile for [endpoint security Antivirus policy](../protect/endpoint-security-antivirus-policy.md#antivirus-profiles) that applies to Windows 10 and Windows 11 devices. These two settings work together to first enable support for a random start time of a device's antivirus scan, and to then define a range of time during which the randomized scan start can begin. These settings are supported with devices managed by Intune and devices managed through the [Defender for Endpoint security settings management](../protect/mde-security-integration.md) scenario.

- [**RandomizeScheduleTaskTimes**](/windows/client-management/mdm/policy-csp-admx-microsoftdefenderantivirus?WT.mc_id=Portal-fx#admx-microsoftdefenderantivirus-randomizescheduletasktimes) – This setting enables randomization of the scan start time on devices.
- [**SchedulerRandomizationTime**](/windows/client-management/mdm/defender-csp?WT.mc_id=Portal-fx#configurationschedulerrandomizationtime) – With this setting, you can set boundaries for the random start time.

In addition to being added to the Microsoft Defender Antivirus profile, both settings are now available from the [settings catalog](../configuration/settings-catalog.md).

#### Deprecation and replacement of two settings found in the Linux and macOS endpoint security Antivirus policies<!-- 25234740  -->

There are two deprecated settings that in the *Antivirus engine* category of [Microsoft Defender Antivirus](../protect/endpoint-security-antivirus-policy.md) profiles of both macOS and Linux. These profiles are available as part of Intune's endpoint security Antivirus policies.

For each platform, a single setting replaces the two deprecated settings. This new setting aligns with how Microsoft Defender for Endpoint manages the device configurations.

The following are the two deprecated settings:

- *Enable real-time protection* now appears as *Enable real-time protection (deprecated)*
- *Enable passive mode* now appears as *Enable passive mode (deprecated)*

The new setting that replaces the two deprecated settings:

- *Enforcement level* - By default, Enforcement level is set to *Passive* and supports options of *Real time* and *On demand*.

These settings are also available from the Intune [settings catalog](../configuration/settings-catalog.md) for each platform, where the old settings are also marked as deprecated and replaced by the new setting.

With this change, a device that has either of the *deprecated* settings configured will continue to apply that configuration until the device is targeted by the new setting *Enforcement level*. Once targeted by Enforcement Level, the deprecated settings no longer are applied to the device.

The *deprecated* settings will be removed from the Antivirus profiles and the settings catalog in a future update to Intune.

> [!NOTE]
> The changes for Linux are now available. The macOS settings are marked as deprecated, but the *Enforcement level* setting will not be available until December.

#### Samsung ended support for kiosk mode on Android device administrator (DA) devices<!-- 24810356  -->

Samsung marked the Samsung Knox kiosk APIs used on Android device administrator as deprecated in Knox 3.7 (Android 11).

Though the functionality might continue to work, there's no guarantee that it will continue working. Samsung won't fix bugs that might arise. For more information on Samsung support for deprecated APIs, see [What kind of support is offered after an API is deprecated?](https://docs.samsungknox.com/dev/knox-sdk/faqs/general/deprecated-api-support-change.htm) (opens Samsung's web site).

Instead, you can manage kiosk devices with Intune using [dedicated device management](../enrollment/android-kiosk-enroll.md).

Applies to:

- Android device administrator (DA)

#### Import and export settings catalog policies<!-- 3470151  -->

#### New setting to block users from using the same password to unlock the device and access the work profile on Android Enterprise personally owned devices with a work profile<!-- 6167371  -->

On Android Enterprise personally owned devices with a work profile, users can use the same password to unlock the device and access the work profile.

There's a new setting that can enforce different passwords to unlock the device and access the work profile (**Devices** > **Manage devices** > **Configuration** > **Create** > **New policy** > **Android Enterprise** > **Personally Owned Work Profile** for platform > **Device Restrictions** for profile type):

- **One lock for device and work profile**: **Block** prevents users from using the same password for the lock screen on the device and work profile. End users are required to enter the device password to unlock the device and enter their work profile password to access their work profile. When set to **Not Configured** (default), Intune doesn't change or update this setting. By default, the OS might allow users to access their work profile using a single password.

This setting is optional and doesn't impact existing configuration profiles.

Currently, if the work profile password doesn't meet the policy requirements, then device users see a notification. The device isn't marked as non-compliant. A separate compliance policy for the work profile is being created and will be available in a future release.

Applies to:

- Android Enterprise personally owned devices with a work profile (BYOD)

For a list of settings you can configure on personally owned devices with a work profile, see [Android Enterprise device settings list to allow or restrict features on personally owned devices using Intune](../configuration/device-restrictions-android-enterprise-personal.md).

### Device enrollment

#### Web based device enrollment with JIT registration for personal iOS/iPadOS devices<!-- 15412485  -->

Intune supports web-based device enrollment with just in time (JIT) registration for personal devices set up via Apple device enrollment. JIT registration reduces the number of authentication prompts shown to users throughout the enrollment experience and establishes SSO across the device. Enrollment takes place on the web version of Intune Company Portal, eliminating need for the Company Portal app. Also, this enrollment method enables employees and students without managed Apple IDs to enroll devices and access volume-purchased apps.

For more information, see [Set up web based device enrollment for iOS](../enrollment/web-based-device-enrollment-ios.md).

### Device management

### Device security

#### Configure declarative software updates and passcode policies for Apple devices in the Settings Catalog<!-- 24989083  -->

You can manage software updates and passcode using Apple's declarative device management (DDM) configuration using the settings catalog (**Devices** > **Manage devices** > **Configuration** > **Create** > **New policy** > **iOS/iPadOS** or **macOS** for platform > **Settings catalog** for profile type > **Declarative device management**).

For more information about DDM, see [Apple's declarative device management (DDM)](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/devicemanagement/leveraging_the_declarative_management_data_model_to_scale_devices) (opens Apple's website).

DDM allows you to install a specific update by an enforced deadline. The autonomous nature of DDM provides an improved user experience as the device handles the entire software update lifecycle. It prompts users that an update is available and also downloads, prepares the device for the installation, & installs the update.

In the settings catalog, the following declarative software update settings are available at **Declarative device management > Software Update**:

- **Details URL**: The web page URL that shows the update details. Typically, this URL is a web page hosted by your organization that users can select if they need organization-specific help with the update.
- **Target Build Version**: The target build version to update the device to, like `20A242`. The build version can include a supplemental version identifier, like `20A242a`. If the build version you enter isn't consistent with the **Target OS Version** value you enter, then the **Target OS Version** value takes precedence.
- **Target Local Date Time**: The local date time value that specifies when to force install the software update. If the user doesn't trigger the software update before this time, then the device force installs it.
- **Target OS Version**: The target OS version to update the device to. This value is the OS version number, like `16.1`. You can also include a supplemental version identifier, like `16.1.1`.

For more information on this feature, see [Manage software updates with the settings catalog](../protect/managed-software-updates-ios-macos.md).

In the settings catalog, the following declarative passcode settings are available at **Declarative device management > Passcode**:

- **Automatic Device Lock**: Enter the maximum time period that a user can be idle before the system automatically locks the device.
- **Maximum Grace Period**: Enter the maximum time period that a user can unlock the device without a passcode.
- **Maximum Number of Failed Attempts**: Enter the maximum number of wrong passcode attempts before:
  - iOS/iPadOS wipes the device
  - macOS locks the device
- **Minimum Passcode Length**: Enter the minimum number of characters a passcode must have.
- **Passcode Reuse Limit**: Enter the number of previously used passcodes that can't be used.
- **Require Complex Passcode**: When set to **True**, a complex passcode is required. A complex passcode doesn't have repeated characters, and doesn't have increasing or decreasing characters, like `123` or `CBA`.
- **Require Passcode on Device**: When set to **True**, the user must set a passcode to access the device. If you don't set other passcode restrictions, then there aren't any requirements about the length or quality of the passcode.

Applies to:

- iOS/iPadOS 17.0 and later
- macOS 14.0 and later

### Monitor and troubleshoot

#### Updated reports for Update rings for Windows 10 and later<!-- 10159960 -->

Reporting for [Update rings for Windows 10 and later](../protect/windows-10-update-rings.md) has been updated to use Intune's improved reporting infrastructure. These changes align to similar improvements introduced for other Intune features.

With this change for reports for Update rings for Windows 10 and later, when you select an update rings policy in the Intune admin center, there isn't a left-pane navigation for *Overview*, *Manage*, or *Monitor* options. Instead, the policy view opens to a single pane that includes the following policy details:

- **Essentials** – including the policy name, created and modified dates, and more details.
- **Device and user check-in status** – This view is the default report view and includes:
  - A high-level overview of device status for this policy, and a *View report* button to open a more comprehensive report view.
  - A streamlined representation and count of the different device status values returned by devices assigned to the policy. The simplified bar and chart replace former doughnut charts seen in the prior reporting representation.
- Two other report tiles to open more reports. These tiles include:
  - **Device assignment status** – This report combines the same information as the previous Device status and User status reports, which are no longer available. However, with this change, pivots and drill-in through based on the user name is no longer available.
  - **Per setting status** – This new report provides success metrics for each setting configured differently than the defaults, allowing for new insight to which settings might not be successfully deploying to your organization.
- **Properties** – View details for each configuration page of the policy, including an option to **Edit** each areas profile details.

For more information about reports for update rings for Windows 10 and later, see [Reports for Update rings for Windows 10 and later policy](../protect/windows-update-reports.md#reports-for-update-rings-for-windows-10-and-later-policy) in the Windows Update reports for Microsoft Intune article.

### Role-based access

#### Updating the scope of UpdateEnrollment<!--25077072 -->

With the introduction of a new role **UpdateEnrollment**, the scope of **UpdateOnboarding** is getting updated.

For more information, see [Remote Help](remote-help-windows.md).

## Week of September 4, 2023

### Device management

#### Microsoft Intune ending support for Android device administrator on devices with GMS access in August 2024<!--13891824 -->

Microsoft Intune is ending support for [Android device administrator management](../enrollment/android-enroll-device-administrator.md) on devices with access to Google Mobile Services (GMS) on August 30, 2024. After that date, device enrollment, technical support, bug fixes, and security fixes will be unavailable.

If you currently use device administrator management, we recommend switching to another Android management option in Intune before support ends.

For more information, see [Ending support for Android device administrator on GMS devices](https://aka.ms/Intune-Android-DA-blog).

## Week of August 28, 2023

### Device configuration

#### Windows and Android support for 4096-bit key size for SCEP and PFX certificate profiles<!--16314561  -->

Intune [SCEP certificate profiles](../protect/certificates-profile-scep.md) and [PKCS certificate profiles](../protect/certificates-pfx-configure.md) for Windows and Android devices now support a **Key size (bits)** of **4096**. This key size is available for new profiles and existing profiles you choose to edit.

- SCEP profiles have always included the *Key size (bits)* setting and now support 4096 as an available configuration option.
- PKCS profiles don't include the *Key size (bits)* setting directly. Instead, an admin must [modify the certificate template on the Certification Authority](../protect/certificates-pfx-configure.md#configure-certificate-templates-on-the-ca) to set the *Minimum key size* to 4096.

If you use a third-party Certificate Authority (CA), you might need to contact your vendor for assistance with implementing the 4096-bit key size.

When updating or deploying new certificate profiles to take advantage of this new key size, we recommend using a staggered deployment approach. This approach can help avoid creating excessive demand for new certificates across a large number of devices at the same time.

With this update, be aware of the following limitations on Windows devices:

- 4096-bit key storage is supported only in the *Software Key Storage Provider* (KSP). The following don't support storing keys of this size:
  - The hardware TPM (Trusted Platform Module). As a workaround you can use the Software KSP for key storage.
  - Windows Hello for Business. There isn't a workaround at this time.

### Tenant administration

#### Access policies for multiple Administrator Approval are now generally available<!-- 24936423   -->

Access policies for multiple Administrator Approval are out of public preview and are now generally available. With these policies, you can protect a resource, like App deployments, by requiring any change to the deployment to be approved by one of a group of users who are *approvers* for the resource, before that change is applied.

For more information, see [Use Access policies to require multiple administrative approval](multi-admin-approval.md).

## Week of August 21, 2023 (Service release 2308)

### App management

#### Managed Home Screen end-users prompted to grant exact alarm permission<!-- 19804494 -->
Managed Home Screen uses the exact alarm permission to do the following actions:

- Automatically sign out users after a set time of inactivity on the device
- Launch a screen saver after a set period of inactivity
- Automatically relaunch MHS after a certain period of time when a user exits kiosk mode

For devices running Android 14 and higher, by default, the exact alarm permission will be denied. To make sure critical user functionality isn't impacted, end-users are prompted to grant exact alarm permission upon first launch of Managed Home Screen. For more information, see [Configure the Microsoft Managed Home Screen app for Android Enterprise](..\apps\app-configuration-managed-home-screen-app.md) and [Android's developer documentation]( https://developer.android.com/about/versions/14/changes/schedule-exact-alarms).

#### Managed Home Screen notifications<!-- 19805777  -->
For Android devices running Android 13 or higher that target API level 33, by default, applications don't have permission to send notifications. In previous versions of Managed Home Screen, when an admin had enabled automatic relaunch of Managed Home Screen, a notification was displayed to alert users of the relaunch. To accommodate change to notification permission, in the scenario when an admin has enabled auto-relaunch of Managed Home Screen, the application will now display a toast message alerting users of the relaunch. Managed Home Screen is able to auto-grant permission for this notification, so no change is required for admins configuring Managed Home Screen to accommodate the change in notification permission with API level 33. For more information about Android 13 (API level 33) notification messages, see the [Android developer documentation](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/views/notifications/notification-permission). For more information about Managed Home Screen, see [Configure the Microsoft Managed Home Screen app for Android Enterprise](../apps/app-configuration-managed-home-screen-app.md).

### Device enrollment

#### Just-in-time registration and compliance remediation for iOS/iPadOS Setup Assistant with modern authentication now generally available<!-- 16276610 -->

Just in time (JIT) registration and compliance remediation for Setup Assistant with modern authentication are now out of preview and generally available. With just in time registration, the device user doesn't need to use the Company Portal app for Microsoft Entra registration and compliance checking. JIT registration and compliance remediation are embedded into the user's provisioning experience, so they can view their compliance status and take action within the work app they're trying to access. Also, this establishes single-sign on across the device. For more information about how to set up JIT registration, see [Set up Just in Time Registration](../enrollment/automated-device-enrollment-authentication.md).

#### Awaiting final configuration for iOS/iPadOS automated device enrollment now generally available<!-- 17473384  -->
Now generally available, *awaiting final configuration* enables a locked experience at the end of Setup Assistant to ensure that critical device configuration policies install on devices. The locked experience works on devices targeted with new and existing enrollment profiles. Supported devices include:

- iOS/iPadOS 13+ devices enrolling with Setup Assistant with modern authentication
- iOS/iPadOS 13+ devices enrolling without user affinity
- iOS/iPadOS 13+ devices enrolling with Microsoft Entra ID shared mode

This setting is applied once during the out-of-box automated device enrollment experience in Setup Assistant. The device user doesn't experience it again unless they re-enroll their device.  Awaiting final configuration is enabled by default for new enrollment profiles. For information about how to enable awaiting final configuration, see [Create an Apple enrollment profile](..//enrollment/device-enrollment-program-enroll-ios.md#create-an-apple-enrollment-profile).

### Device management

#### Changes to Android notification permission prompt behavior<!-- 19783177  -->
We've updated how our Android apps handle notification permissions to align with recent changes made by Google to the Android platform.  As a result of Google changes, notification permissions are granted to apps as follows:

- **On devices running Android 12 and earlier**: Apps are permitted to send notifications to users by default.
- **On devices running Android 13 and later**: Notification permissions vary depending on the API the app targets.
  - *Apps targeting API 32 and lower*: Google has added a notification permission prompt that appears when the user opens the app. Management apps can still configure apps so that they're automatically granted notification permissions.
  - *Apps targeting API 33 and higher*: App developers define when the notification permission prompts appear. Management apps can still configure apps so that they're automatically granted notification permissions.

You and your device users can expect to see the following changes now that our apps target API 33:

- **Company Portal used for work profile management**: Users see a notification permission prompt in the personal instance of the Company Portal when they first open it. Users don't see a notification permission prompt in the work profile instance of Company Portal because notification permissions are automatically permitted for Company Portal in the work profile. Users can silence app notifications in the Settings app.
- **Company Portal used for device administrator management**: Users see a notification permission prompt when they first open the Company Portal app.  Users can adjust app notification settings in the Settings app.
- **Microsoft Intune app**: No changes to existing behavior. Users don't see a prompt because notifications are automatically permitted for the Microsoft Intune app.  Users can adjust some app notification settings in the Settings app.
- **Microsoft Intune app for AOSP**: No changes to existing behavior. Users don't see a prompt because notifications are automatically permitted for the Microsoft Intune app.  Users can't adjust app notification settings in the Settings app.

### Device security

#### Defender Update controls to deploy updates for Defender is now generally available<!-- 24666660 -->
The profile **Defender Update controls** for Intune Endpoint security Antivirus policy, which manages update settings for Microsoft Defender, is now generally available. This profile is available for the *Windows 10, Windows 11, and Windows Server* platform. While in public preview, this profile was available for the *Windows 10 and later* platform.

The profile includes settings for the rollout release channel by which devices and users receive Defender Updates that are related to daily security intelligence updates, monthly platform updates, and monthly engine updates.

This profile includes the following settings, which are all directly taken from [Defender CSP - Windows Client Management](/windows/client-management/mdm/policy-csp-Defender).

- Engine Updates Channel
- Platform Updates Channel
- Security Intelligence Updates Channel

These settings are also available from the [settings catalog](../configuration/settings-catalog.md) for the *Windows 10 and later* profile.

#### Elevation report by applications for Endpoint Privilege Management<!-- 24593324 -->
We've released a new report named **Elevation report by applications** for Endpoint Privilege Management (EPM). With [this new report](../protect/epm-reports.md#elevation-report-by-applications) you can view all managed and unmanaged elevations, which are aggregated by the application that elevated. This report can aid you in identifying applications that might require elevation rules to function properly, including rules for child processes.

You'll find the report in the Report node for EPM in the [Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431). Navigate to **Endpoint security** > **Endpoint Privilege Management** and then select the **Reports** tab.

#### New settings available for macOS Antivirus policy<!-- 24191427 -->
The [Microsoft Defender Antivirus](../protect/endpoint-security-antivirus-policy.md) profile for macOS devices has been updated with nine more settings, and three new settings categories:

**Antivirus engine** – The following settings are new in this category:

- **Degree of parallelism for on-demand scans** – Specifies the degree of parallelism for on-demand scans. This setting corresponds to the number of threads used to perform the scan and impacts the CPU usage, and the duration of the on-demand scan.
- **Enable file hash computation** – Enables or disables file hash computation feature. When this feature is enabled, Windows Defender computes hashes for files it scans. This setting helps improve the accuracy of Custom Indicator matches. However, enabling Enable file hash computation can impact device performance.
- **Run a scan after definitions are updated** – Specifies whether to start a process scan after new security intelligence updates are downloaded on the device. Enabling this setting triggers an antivirus scan on the running processes of the device.
- **Scanning inside archive files** – If true, Defender unpacks archives and scan files inside them. Otherwise archive content is skipped, which improves scanning performance.

**Network protection** – A new category that includes the following setting:

- **Enforcement level** – Configure this setting to specify if network protection is *disabled*, *in audit mode*, or *enforced*.

**Tamper  protection** - A new category that includes the following setting:

- **Enforcement level** - Specify whether tamper protection is *disabled*, in *audit mode*, or *enforced*.

**User interface preferences** – A new category that includes the following settings:

- **Control sign-in to consumer version** - Specify whether users can sign into the consumer version of Microsoft Defender.
- **Show / hide status menu icon** – Specify whether the status menu icon (shown in the top-right corner of the screen) is hidden or not.
- **User initiated feedback** – Specify whether users can submit feedback to Microsoft by going to *Help* > *Send Feedback*.

New profiles that you create include the original settings and the new settings. Your existing profiles automatically update to include the new settings, with each new setting set to *Not configured* until you choose to edit that profile to change it.

For more information about how to set preferences for Microsoft Defender for Endpoint on macOS in enterprise organizations, see [Set preferences for Microsoft Defender for Endpoint on macOS](/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/mac-preferences?view=o365-worldwide&preserve-view=true).

### Intune apps

#### Newly available protected app for Intune<!-- 24400497  -->
The following protected app is now available for Microsoft Intune:

- VerityRMS by Mackey LLC (iOS)

For more information about protected apps, see [Microsoft Intune protected apps](../apps/apps-supported-intune-apps.md).

### Monitor and troubleshoot

#### CloudDesktop log now collected with Windows diagnostics data<!-- 24541366 -->
The Intune remote action to [collect diagnostics](../remote-actions/collect-diagnostics.md) from a Windows device now includes data in a log file.

Log file:
- %temp%\CloudDesktop\*.log

#### Anomaly detection device cohorts in Intune Endpoint analytics is generally available<!-- 24577118  -->
Anomaly detection device cohorts in Intune Endpoint analytics is now generally available.

Device cohorts are identified in devices associated with a high or medium severity anomaly. Devices are correlated into groups based on one or more factors they have in common like an app version, driver update, OS version, device model. A correlation group will contain a detailed view with key information about the common factors between all affected devices in that group. You can also view a breakdown of devices currently affected by the anomaly and 'at risk' devices. "At risk" devices haven't yet shown symptoms of the anomaly.

For more information, see [Anomaly detection in Endpoint analytics](../../analytics/anomaly-detection.md#anomalies-tab).

#### Improved user experience for device timeline in Endpoint Analytics<!-- 24604944 -->
The user interface (UI) for device timeline in Endpoint analytics is improved and includes more advanced capabilities (support for sorting, searching, filtering, and exports). When viewing a specific device timeline in Endpoint analytics, you can search by event name or details. You can also filter the events and choose the source and level of events that appear on the device timeline and select a time range of interest.

For more information, see [Enhanced device timeline](../../analytics/enhanced-device-timeline.md).

#### Updates for compliance policies and reports<!--15425771  -->
We've made several improvements to the Intune compliance policies and reports. With these changes, the reports more closely align to the experience in use for device configuration profiles and reports. We've updated our [compliance report documentation](../protect/compliance-policy-monitor.md) to reflect the available compliance report improvements.

Compliance report improvements include:

- Compliance details for Linux devices.
- Redesigned reports that are up-to-date and simplified, with newer report versions beginning to replace older report versions, which will remain available for some time.
- When viewing a policy for compliance, there isn't a left-pane navigation. Instead, the policy view opens to a single pane that defaults to the Monitor tab and its Device status view.
  - This view provides a high-level overview of device status for this policy, supports drilling in to review the full report, and a per-setting status view of the same policy.
  - The doughnut chart is replaced by a streamlined representation and count of the different device status values returned by devices assigned the policy.
  - You can select the Properties tab to view the policy details, and review and edit its configuration and assignments.
  - The *Essentials* section is removed with those details appearing in the policy's *Properties* tab.
- The updated status reports support sorting by columns, the use of filters, and search. Combined, these enhancements enable you to pivot the report to display specific subsets of details you want to view at that time. With these enhancements, we have removed the *User status* report as it has become redundant. Now, while viewing the default *Device status* report you can focus the report to display the same information that was available from *User status* by sorting on the *User Principal Name* column, or searching for a specific username in the search box.
- When viewing status reports, the count of devices that Intune displays now remains consistent between different report views as you drill in for deeper insights or details.

For more information about these changes, see the Intune Support Team blog at [https://aka.ms/Intune/device_compl_report](https://aka.ms/Intune/device_compl_report).

## Week of August 14, 2023

### App management

#### Use the Turn off the Store application setting to disable end user access to Store apps, and allow managed Intune Store apps<!-- 16544362 -->
In Intune, you can use the new **Store app** type to deploy Store apps to your devices.

Now, you can use the **Turn off the Store application** policy to disable end users' direct access to Store apps. When it's disabled, end users can still access and install Store apps from the Windows Company Portal app and through Intune app management. If you want to allow random store app installs outside of Intune, then don't configure this policy.

The previous **Only display the private store within the Microsoft Store app** policy doesn't prevent end users from directly accessing the store using the Windows Package Manager `winget` APIs. So, if your goal is to block random unmanaged Store application installs on client devices, then it's recommended to use the **Turn off the Store application** policy. Don't use the **Only display the private store within the Microsoft Store app** policy.
Applies to:

- Windows 10 and later

For more information, see [Add Microsoft Store Apps to Microsoft Intune](../apps/store-apps-microsoft.md).

## Week of August 7, 2023

#### Compliance Retrieval service support for MAC address endpoints<!--  24332824  -->
We've now added MAC address support to the Compliance Retrieval service.

The initial release of the CR service included support for using only the Intune device ID with the intent to eliminate the need to manage internal identifiers like serial numbers and MAC addresses. With this update, organizations that prefer to use MAC addresses over certificate authentication can continue to do so while implementing the CR service.

While this update adds MAC address support to the CR service, our recommendation is to use certificate-based authentication with the Intune device ID included in the certificate.

For information about the CR service as a replacement for the Intune Network Access Control (NAC) service, see the Intune blog at [https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/intune-customer-success/new-microsoft-intune-service-for-network-access-control/ba-p/2544696](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/intune-customer-success/new-microsoft-intune-service-for-network-access-control/ba-p/2544696).

#### Settings insight within Intune security baselines is generally available<!-- 24507891   -->

Navigate to **Endpoint security** > **Security baselines**. While creating and editing a workflow, these insights are available for all settings with light bulbs.

### Device security

#### Tamper protection support for Windows on Azure Virtual Desktop<!--15135590  -->
Intune now supports use of endpoint security [Antivirus policy](../protect/endpoint-security-antivirus-policy.md#prerequisites-for-tamper-protection) to manage *Tamper protection* for Windows on Azure Virtual Desktop multi-session devices. Support for Tamper protection requires devices to onboard to Microsoft Defender for Endpoint before the policy that enables Tamper protection is applied.

#### EpmTools PowerShell module for Endpoint Privilege Management<!-- 22800379  -->
The EpmTools PowerShell module is now available for use with Intune Endpoint Privilege Management (EPM). EpmTools includes the cmdlets like **Get-FileAttributes** that you can use to retrieve file details to help build accurate elevation rules, and other cmdlets you can use to troubleshoot or diagnose EPM policy deployments.

For more information, see [EpmTools PowerShell module](../protect/epm-overview.md#epmtools-powershell-module).

#### Endpoint Privilege Management support to manage elevation rules for child processes<!-- 15931887 -->
With Intune Endpoint Privilege Management (EPM) you can manage which files and processes are allowed to *Run as Administrator* on your Windows devices.  Now, EPM [elevation rules](../protect/epm-policies.md#windows-elevation-rules-policy) support a new setting, **Child process behavior**.

With *Child process behavior*, your rules can manage the elevation context for any child processes created by the managed process. Options include:

- Allowing all child processes created by the managed process to always run as elevated.
- Allow a child process to run as elevated only when it matches the rule that manages its parent process.
- Deny all child processes from running in an elevated context, in which case they run as standard users.

Endpoint Privilege Management is available as an Intune add-on. For more information, see [Use Intune Suite add-on capabilities](intune-add-ons.md).

### Intune apps

#### Newly available protected app for Intune<!-- 24323519  -->
The following protected app is now available for Microsoft Intune:

- Dooray! for Intune

For more information about protected apps, see [Microsoft Intune protected apps](../apps/apps-supported-intune-apps.md).

### Monitor and troubleshoot

#### Updated reports for Setting compliance and Policy compliance are in public preview<!-- 15425624, 15425656  -->
We've released two new reports as a public preview for Intune device compliance. You can find these new preview reports in the Intune admin center at **Reports** > **Device compliance** > *Reports* tab:

- [Setting compliance (preview)](reports.md)
- [Policy compliance (preview)](reports.md)

Both reports are new instances of existing reports, and deliver improvements over the older versions, including:

- Details for Linux settings and devices
- Support for sorting, searching, filtering, exports, and paging views
- Drill-down reports for deeper details, which are filtered based on the column you select.
- Devices are represented a single time. This behavior is in contrast to the original reports, which could count a device more than once if multiple users used that device.

Eventually, the [older report versions](../protect/compliance-policy-monitor.md#other-compliance-reports) that are still available in the admin center at *Devices > Monitor* will be retired.

## Week of July 10, 2023

### App management

#### Updates to app configuration policy reporting<!-- 18098046  -->

### Device management

#### Intune support for Zebra devices on Android 13<!-- 17192763 -->
Zebra will be releasing support for Android 13 on their devices. You can read more at [Migrating to Android 13](https://techdocs.zebra.com/lifeguard/a13/) (opens Zebra's web site).

- **Temporary issues on Android 13**

  The Intune team thoroughly tested Android 13 on Zebra devices. Everything continues working as normal, except for the following two temporary issues for device administrator (DA) devices.

  For Zebra devices running Android 13 and enrolled with DA management:

  1. App installations don't happen silently. Instead, users get a notification from the Company Portal app (if they allow notifications) that asks for permission to allow the app installation. If a user doesn't accept the app installation when prompted, then the app doesn't install. Users will have a persistent notification in the notification drawer until they allow the installation.

  2. New MX profiles don't apply to Android 13 devices. Newly enrolled Android 13 devices don't receive configuration from MX profiles. MX profiles that previously applied to enrolled devices continue to apply.

  In an update coming later in July, these issues will be resolved and the behavior will return to how it was before.

- **Update devices to Android 13**

  You'll soon be able to use Intune's Zebra LifeGuard Over-the-Air integration to update Android Enterprise dedicated and fully managed devices to Android 13. For more information, see [Zebra LifeGuard Over-the-Air Integration with Microsoft Intune](../protect/zebra-lifeguard-ota-integration.md).

  Before you migrate to Android 13, review [Migrating to Android 13](https://techdocs.zebra.com/lifeguard/a13/) (opens Zebra's web site).

- **OEMConfig for Zebra devices on Android 13**

  OEMConfig for Zebra devices on Android 13 requires using Zebra's new [Zebra OEMConfig Powered by MX OEMConfig app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.zebra.oemconfig.release) (opens the Google Play store). This new app can also be used on Zebra devices running Android 11, but not earlier versions.

  For more information on this app, go to the [New Zebra OEMConfig app for Android 11 and later](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/intune-customer-success/new-zebra-oemconfig-app-for-android-11-and-later/ba-p/3846730) blog post.

  The [Legacy Zebra OEMConfig app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.zebra.oemconfig.common) (opens the Google Play store) can only be used on Zebra devices running Android 11 and earlier.

For more general information about Intune Android 13 support, go to the [Day Zero support for Android 13 with Microsoft Intune](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/intune-customer-success/day-zero-support-for-android-13-with-microsoft-intune/ba-p/3601760) blog post.

### Device security

#### Defender for Endpoint security settings management enhancements and support for Linux and macOS in public preview<!-- 14743017, 15319901, 18713045, 18713050, 17757959 17757967, 17758270  -->
With [Defender for Endpoint security settings management](../protect/mde-security-integration.md), you can use Intune's endpoint security policies to manage Defender security settings on devices that onboard to Defender for Endpoint but aren't enrolled with Intune.

Now, you can opt in to a public preview from within the Microsoft Defender portal to gain access to several enhancements for this scenario:

- Intune's endpoint security policies become visible in and can be managed from within the Microsoft Defender portal. This enables security admins to remain in the Defender portal to manage Defender and the Intune endpoint security policies for Defender security settings management.

- Security settings management supports deploying Intune endpoint security Antivirus policies to devices that run Linux and macOS.

- For Windows devices, the Windows Security Experience profile is now supported with security settings management.

- A new onboarding workflow removes the Microsoft Entra hybrid join prerequisite. Microsoft Entra hybrid join requirements prevented many Windows devices from successfully onboarding to Defender for Endpoint security settings management. With this change, those devices can now complete enrollment and start processing policies for security settings management.

- Intune creates a synthetic registration in Microsoft Entra ID for devices that can't fully register with Microsoft Entra ID. Synthetic registrations are device objects created in Microsoft Entra ID that enable devices to receive and report back on Intune policies for security settings management. In addition, should a device with a synthetic registration become fully registered, the synthetic registration is removed from Microsoft Entra ID in deference to the full registration.

If you don't opt in to the Defender for Endpoint Public Preview, the previous behaviors remain in place. In this case, while you can view the Antivirus profiles for Linux, you can't deploy it as its supported only for devices managed by Defender. Similarly, the macOS profile that's currently available for devices enrolled with Intune can't be deployed to devices managed by Defender.

Applies to:

- Linux
- macOS
- Windows

### Device management

#### Windows Driver update management in Intune is generally available<!-- 5584639  -->
Announcing the general availability of **Windows Driver update management** in Microsoft Intune. With driver update policies, you can view a list of driver updates that are recommended and applicable to your Windows 10 and Windows 11 device that are assigned to the policy. Applicable driver updates are those that can update a device's driver version. Driver update policies update automatically to add new updates as they're published by the driver manufacturer and remove older drivers that no longer apply to any device with the policy.

Update policies can be configured for one of two approval methods:

- With *Automatic approval*, each new *recommended* driver that's published by the driver manufacturer and added to the policy is automatically approved for deployment to applicable devices. Policies set for automatic approvals can be configured with a deferral period before the automatically approved updates are installed on devices. This deferral gives you time to review the driver and to pause its deployment if necessary.

- With *manual approval*, all new driver updates are automatically added to the policy, but an admin must explicitly approve each update before Windows Update deploys it to a device. When you manually approve an update, you choose the date when Windows Update will begin to deploy it to your devices.

To help you manage driver updates, you review a policy and decline an update you don't want to install. You can also indefinitely pause any approved update, and reapprove a paused update to restart its deployment.

This release also includes [driver update reports](../protect/windows-update-reports.md#reports-for-windows-driver-updates-policy) that provide a success summary, per-device update status for each approved driver, and error and troubleshooting information. You can also select an individual driver update and view details about it across all the policies that include that driver version.

To learn about using Windows Driver update policies, see [Manage policy for Windows Driver updates with Microsoft Intune](../protect/windows-driver-updates-overview.md).

Applies to:

- Windows 10
- Windows 11

#### New endpoint security Application Control policy in preview<!-- 15711976 -->
As a public preview, you can use a new endpoint security policy category, Application Control. Endpoint security Application Control policy includes:

- Policy to set the Intune Management Extension as a tenant-wide managed installer. When enabled as a managed installer, apps you deploy through Intune (after enablement of Managed Installer) to Windows devices are tagged as installed by Intune. This tag becomes useful when you use Application Control policies to manage which apps you want to allow or block from running on your managed devices.

- Application Control policies that are an implementation of Defender Application Control (WDAC). With Endpoint security Application Control policies, it's easy to configure policy that allows trusted apps to run on your managed devices. Trusted apps are installed by a managed installer or from the App store. In addition to built-in trust settings, these policies also support custom XML for application control so you can allow other apps from other sources to run to meet your organizations requirements.

To get started with using this new policy type, see [Manage approved apps for Windows devices with Application Control policy and Managed Installers for Microsoft Intune](../protect/endpoint-security-app-control-policy.md)

#### Group policy analytics supports scope tags<!-- 12714882  -->
In Group Policy analytics, you import your on-premises GPO. The tool analyzes your GPOs and shows the settings that can (and can't) be used in Intune.

When you import your GPO XML file in Intune, you can select an existing scope tag. If you don't select a scope tag, then the **Default** scope tag is automatically selected. Previously, when you imported a GPO, the scope tags assigned to you were automatically applied to the GPO.

Only admins within that scope tag can see the imported policies. Admins not in that scope tag can't see the imported policies.

Also, admins within their scope tag can migrate the imported policies that they have permissions to see. To migrate an imported GPO into a Settings Catalog policy, a scope tag must be associated with the imported GPO. If a scope tag isn't associated, then it can't migrate to a Settings Catalog policy. If no scope tag is selected, then a default scope tag is automatically applied.

### Device enrollment

#### Account driven Apple User Enrollment available for iOS/iPadOS 15+ devices (public preview)<!-- 14161683  -->
Intune supports account driven user enrollment, a new and improved variation of Apple User Enrollment for iOS/iPadOS 15+ devices. Now available for public preview, the new option utilizes just-in-time registration, which eliminates the need for the Company Portal app during enrollment. Device users can initiate enrollment directly in the Settings app, resulting in a shorter and more efficient onboarding experience. You can continue to target iOS/iPadOS devices using the existing profile-based user enrollment method that uses Company Portal. Devices running iOS/iPadOS, version 14.8.1 and earlier remain unaffected by this update and can continue to use the existing method. For more information, see [Set up account driven Apple User Enrollment](../enrollment/apple-account-driven-user-enrollment.md).

### Device security

#### New security baseline for Microsoft 365 Office Apps<!-- 9587103  -->
We've released a new security baseline to help you manage security configurations for **M365 Office Apps**. This new baseline uses an updated template and experience that uses the unified settings platform seen in the Intune settings catalog. You can view the list of settings in the new baseline at [Microsoft 365 Apps for Enterprise baseline settings (Office)](../protect/security-baseline-v2-office-settings.md).

The new Intune security baseline format aligns the presentation of settings that are available to the settings found in the Intune settings catalog. This alignment helps resolve past issues for setting names and implementations for settings that could create conflicts. The new format also improves the reporting experience for baselines in the Intune admin center.

The Microsoft 365 Office Apps baseline can help you rapidly deploy configurations to your Office Apps that meet the security recommendations of the Office and security teams at Microsoft. As with all baselines, the default baseline represents the recommended configurations. You can modify the default baseline to meet the requirements of your organization.

To learn more, see [Security baselines overview](../protect/security-baselines.md).

Applies to:

- Windows 10
- Windows 11

#### Security baseline update for Microsoft Edge version 112<!-- 3408610  -->
We've released a new version of the Intune security baseline for Microsoft Edge, version 112. In addition to releasing this new version for Microsoft Edge, the new baseline uses an updated template experience that uses the unified settings platform seen in the Intune settings catalog. You can view the list of settings in the new baseline at [Microsoft Edge baseline settings (version 112 and higher)](../protect/security-baseline-v2-edge-settings.md).

The new Intune security baseline format aligns the presentation of settings that are available to the settings found in the Intune settings catalog. This alignment helps resolve past issues for setting names and implementations for settings that could create conflicts. The new format also improves the reporting experience for baselines in the Intune admin center.

Now that the new baseline version is available, all new profiles you create for Microsoft Edge use the new baseline format and version. While the new version becomes the default baseline version, you can continue to use the profiles you've previously created for older versions of Microsoft Edge. But, you can't create new profiles for those older versions of Microsoft Edge.

To learn more, see [Security baselines overview](../protect/security-baselines.md).

### App management

#### Changes to iCloud app backup and restore behavior on iOS/iPadOS and macOS devices<!-- 16261392  -->
As an app setting, you can select to **Prevent iCloud app backup** for iOS/iPadOS and macOS devices. You can *not* backup managed App Store apps and line-of-business (LOB) apps on iOS/iPadOS, as well as managed App Store apps on macOS devices (macOS LOB apps don't support this feature), for both user and device licensed VPP/non-VPP apps. This update includes both new and existing App Store/LOB apps sent with and without VPP that are being added to Intune and targeted to users and devices.

Preventing the backup of the specified managed apps ensures that these apps can be properly deployed via Intune when the device is enrolled and restored from backup. If the admin configures this new setting for new or existing apps in their tenant, then managed apps can and will be reinstalled for devices. But, Intune doesn't allow them to be backed up.

This new setting appears in [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431) by modifying the properties of an app. For an existing app, you can select **Apps** > **iOS/iPadOS** or **macOS** > *select the app* > **Properties** > Assignment **Edit**.

#### Manage Windows LAPS with Intune policies (public preview)<!-- 11890571  -->
Now available in a public preview, manage Windows Local Administrator Password Solution (Windows LAPS) with Microsoft Intune [Account protection policies](../protect/endpoint-security-account-protection-policy.md). To get started, see [Intune support for Windows LAPS](../protect/windows-laps-overview.md).

[Windows LAPS](/windows-server/identity/laps/laps-overview) is a Windows feature that allows you to manage and backs up the password of a local administrator account on your Microsoft Entra joined or Windows Server Active Directory-joined devices.

To manage LAPS, Intune configures the Windows [LAPS configuration service provider](/windows/client-management/mdm/LAPS-csp) (CSP) that is built in to Windows devices. It takes precedence over other sources of Windows LAPS configurations, like GPOs or the Microsoft Legacy LAPS tool. Some of the capabilities you can use when Intune manages Windows LAPS include:

- Define password requirements like complexity and length that apply to the local administrator accounts on a device.
- Configure devices to rotate their local admin account passwords on a schedule. And, back up the account and password in your Microsoft Entra ID or on-premises Active Directory.
- Use an Intune device action from the admin center to manually rotate the password for an account on your own schedule.
- View account details from within the Intune admin center, like the account name and password. This information can help you recover devices that are otherwise inaccessible.
- Use Intune reports to monitor your LAPS policies, and when devices last rotated passwords manually or by schedule.

Applies to:

- Windows 10
- Windows 11

#### New settings available for macOS software update policies<!-- 16646756  -->
macOS software update policies now include the following settings to help manage when updates install on a device. These settings are available when the *All other updates* update type is configured to *Install later*:

- **Max User Deferrals**:  When the *All other updates* update type is configured to *Install later*, this setting allows you to specify the maximum number of times a user can postpone a minor OS update before it's installed. The system prompts the user once a day. Available for devices running macOS 12 and later.

- **Priority**: When the *All other updates* update type is configured to *Install later*, this setting allows you to specify values of *Low* or *High* for the scheduling priority for downloading and preparing minor OS updates. Available for devices running macOS 12.3 and later.

For more information, see [Use Microsoft Intune policies to manage macOS software updates](../protect/software-updates-macos.md).

To access the Partner portals page, you must enable the Devices pane preview and then navigate to **Devices** > **Partner Portals**.

#### Windows Update compatibility reports for Apps and Drivers are now generally available<!-- 17917026  -->
The following Microsoft Intune reports for [Windows Update compatibility](../protect/windows-update-compatibility-reports.md) are out of preview and now generally available:

- **Windows feature update device readiness report** - This report provides per-device information about compatibility risks that are associated with an upgrade or update to a chosen version of Windows.

- **Windows feature update compatibility risks report** - This report provides a summary view of the top compatibility risks across your organization for a chosen version of Windows. You can use this report to understand which compatibility risks impact the greatest number of devices in your organization.

These reports can help you plan an upgrade from Windows 10 to 11, or for installing the latest Windows feature update.

### Device security

#### Microsoft Intune Endpoint Privilege Management is generally available<!--1564177  -->
Microsoft Endpoint Privilege Management (EPM) is now generally available and no longer in preview.

With [Endpoint Privilege Management](../protect/epm-overview.md), admins can set policies that allow standard users to perform tasks normally reserved for an administrator. To do so, you configure policies for *automatic* and *user-confirmed* workflows that elevate the run-time permissions for apps or processes you select. You then assign these policies to users or devices that have end users running without Administrator privileges. After the device receives a policy, EPM brokers the elevation on behalf of the user, allowing them to elevate approved applications without needing full administrator privileges. EPM also includes built-in insights and reporting.

Now that EPM is out of preview, it requires another license to use. You can choose between a stand-alone license that adds only EPM, or license EPM as part of the Microsoft Intune Suite. For more information, see [Use Intune Suite add-on capabilities](intune-add-ons.md).

While Endpoint Privilege Management is now generally available, the [reports for EPM](../protect/epm-reports.md) will transition to a feature in *preview*, and will receive some more enhancements before being removed from preview.

#### Support for WDAC Application ID tagging with Intune Firewall Rules policy<!-- 17224780  -->
Intune's *Microsoft Defender Firewall Rules* profiles, which are available as part of [endpoint security Firewall policy](../protect/endpoint-security-firewall-policy.md), now include the Policy App ID setting. This setting is described in the [*MdmStore/FirewallRules/{FirewallRuleName}/PolicyAppId*](/windows/client-management/mdm/Firewall-csp?WT.mc_id=Portal-fx#mdmstorefirewallrulesfirewallrulenamepolicyappid) CSP and supports specifying a Windows Defender Application Control (WDAC) Application ID tag.

With this capability, you can scope your firewall rules to an application or a group of applications and rely on your WDAC policies to define those applications. By using tags to link to and rely on WDAC policies, your Firewall Rules policy won't need to rely on the firewall rules option of an absolute file path, or use of a variable file path that can reduce security of the rule.

Use of this capability requires you to have WDAC policies in place that include *AppId* tags that you can then specify in your Intune Microsoft Defender Firewall Rules.

For more information, see the following articles in the Windows Defender Application Control documentation:

- [About application control for Windows](/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-defender-application-control/windows-defender-application-control)
- [WDAC Application ID (AppId) Tagging guide](/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-defender-application-control/appidtagging/windows-defender-application-control-appid-tagging-guide)

Applies to:

- Windows 10/11

#### New App and browser isolation profile for Intune's endpoint security Attack Surface Reduction policy<!-- 17392386  -->
We have released a new experience creating new *App and Browser Isolation* profiles for endpoint security Attack Surface Reduction policy.

This update applies only for the new [App and Browser Isolation](../protect/endpoint-security-asr-policy.md#attack-surface-reduction-profiles) policies you create for the *Windows 10 and later* platform.

This update is part of the continuing rollout of new profiles for endpoint security policies, which began in April 2022.

Additionally, the new profile includes the following changes for the settings it includes:

- **Block external content from non-enterprise approved sites** - This setting is removed from the updated profile as it was supported only by Microsoft Edge Legacy. Microsoft Edge Legacy support ended in March 2021. [Microsoft 365 apps say farewell to Internet Explorer 11 and Windows 10 sunsets Microsoft Edge Legacy - Microsoft Community Hub](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-365-blog/microsoft-365-apps-say-farewell-to-internet-explorer-11-and/ba-p/1591666).

- **Clipboard file type** – This setting is added to the updated profile and determines the type of content that can be copied from the host to Application Guard environment and vice versa. You can view the CSP for this new setting at [Settings/ClipboardFileType](/windows/client-management/mdm/windowsdefenderapplicationguard-csp#settingsclipboardfiletype) in the WindowsDefenderApplicationGuard CSP documentation.

### Device security

#### Microsoft Intune Endpoint Privilege Management (public preview)<!-- 15654169   -->
As a public preview, you can now use Microsoft Intune Endpoint Privilege Management. With Endpoint Privilege Management, admins can set policies that allow standard users to perform tasks normally reserved for an administrator. Endpoint Privilege Management can be configured in the [Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431) at **Endpoint security** > **Endpoint Privilege Management**.

With the public preview, you can configure policies for *automatic* and *user-confirmed* workflows that elevate the run-time permissions for apps or processes you select. You then assign these policies to users or devices that have end users running without Administrator privileges. Once policy is received, Endpoint Privilege Management will broker the elevation on behalf of the user, allowing them to elevate approved applications without needing full administrator privileges. The preview also includes built-in insights and reporting for Endpoint Privilege Management.

To learn how to activate the public preview and use Endpoint Privilege Management policies, start with [Use Endpoint Privilege Management with Microsoft Intune](../protect/epm-overview.md). Endpoint Privilege Management is part of the [Intune Suite](intune-add-ons.md) offering, and free to try while it remains in public preview.

### App management

#### Trusted Root Certificates Management for Intune App SDK for Android<!-- 15135752 -->
If your Android application requires SSL/TLS certificates issued by an on-premises or private certificate authority to provide secure access to internal websites and applications, the Intune App SDK for Android now has support for certificate trust management. For more information and examples, see [Trusted Root Certificates Management](../developer/app-sdk-android-phase7.md#trusted-root-certificates-management).

#### System context support for UWP apps<!-- 16544103 -->
In addition to user context, you can deploy Universal Windows Platform (UWP) apps from the **Microsoft Store app (new)** in system context. If a provisioned *.appx* app is deployed in system context, the app auto-installs for each user that logs in. If an individual end user uninstalls the user context app, the app still shows as installed because it's still provisioned. In addition, the app must not already be installed for any users on the device. Our general recommendation is to not mix install contexts when deploying apps. Win32 apps from the **Microsoft Store app (new)** already support system context.

## Week of March 6, 2023

### App management

#### Deploy Win32 apps to device groups<!-- 7359954 -->

We recommend taking the following actions to avoid issues with Intune access and automated scripts:

* Update login or automation to point to `https://intune.microsoft.com`.
* Update your firewalls, as needed, to allow access to the new URL.
* Add the new URL to your favorites and bookmarks.
* Notify your helpdesk and update IT administrator documentation.

#### There are default settings for SSO extension requests on iOS, iPadOS, and macOS devices<!-- 15082414-15084030 -->
When you create a single sign-on app extension configuration profile, there are some settings that you configure. The following settings use the following default values for all SSO extension requests:

- **AppPrefixAllowList** key
  - macOS default value: `com.microsoft.,com.apple.`
  - iOS/iPadOS default value: `com.apple.`

- **browser_sso_interaction_enabled** key
  - macOS default value: `1`
  - iOS/iPadOS default value: `1`

- **disable_explicit_app_prompt** key

For more information, see [Add Microsoft Store apps to Microsoft Intune](../apps/store-apps-microsoft.md).

### Tenant administration

#### Access policies for multiple Administrator Approval (public preview)<!-- 9348867  -->
In public preview, you can use Intune *access policies* to require that a second Administrator Approval account approve a change before the change is applied. This capability is known as multiple Administrator Approval (MAA).

You create an access policy to protect a type of resource, like App deployments. Each access policy also includes a group of users who are *approvers* for the changes protected by the policy. When a resource, like an app deployment configuration, is protected by an access policy, any changes that made to the deployment, including creating, deleting, or modifying an existing deployment, won't apply until a member of the approvers group for that access policy reviews and approves that change.

Approvers can also reject requests. The individual requesting a change and the approver can provide notes about the change, or why it was approved or rejected.

Access policies are supported for the following resources:

- **Apps** – Applies to [app deployments](../apps/apps-add.md), but doesn't apply to app protection policies.
- **Scripts** – Applies to deploying scripts to devices that run [macOS](../apps/macos-shell-scripts.md) or [Windows](../apps/powershell-scripts.md).

For more information, see [Use Access policies to require multiple administrative approval](multi-admin-approval.md).

### Device security

#### Microsoft Tunnel for Mobile Application Management for Android (Preview)<!-- 15769204 -->

This preview supports Android, and without any changes to your existing Tunnel infrastructure, supports the Tunnel VPN gateway for:

- Secure access to on-premises apps and resources using modern authentication
- Single Sign On and Conditional Access

To use Tunnel MAM, unenrolled devices must install Microsoft Edge, Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, and the Company Portal. You can then use the Microsoft Intune admin center to configure the following profiles for the unenrolled devices:

- An App configuration profile for managed apps, to configure Microsoft Defender on devices for use as the Tunnel client app.
- A second App configuration profile for managed apps, to configure Microsoft Edge to connect to Tunnel.
- An App protection profile to enable automatic start of the Microsoft Tunnel connection.

Applies to:

This capability is available in [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431) by selecting **Apps** > **All Apps** > **Create** > **Managed Google Play app**. For more information, see [Add a Managed Google Play store app directly in the Intune admin center](../apps/apps-add-android-for-work.md#add-a-managed-google-play-store-app-directly-in-the-microsoft-intune-admin-center).

### Device configuration

#### New password complexity setting for Android Enterprise 12+ personally owned devices with a work profile<!-- 12436068  -->
On Android Enterprise 11 and older personally owned devices with a work profile, you can set the following password settings:

- **Devices** > **Compliance** > **Android Enterprise** for platform > **Personally owned work profile** > **System security** > **Required password type**, **Minimum password length**
- **Devices** > **Manage devices** > **Configuration** > **Android Enterprise** for platform > **Personally owned work profile** > **Device restrictions** > **Work profile settings** > **Required password type**, **Minimum password length**
- **Devices** > **Manage devices** > **Configuration** > **Android Enterprise** for platform > **Personally owned work profile** > **Device restrictions** > **Password** > **Required password type**, **Minimum password length**

Google is deprecating the **Required password type** and **Minimum password length** settings for Android 12+ personally owned devices with a work profile and replacing them with new password complexity requirements. For more information about this change, go to [Day zero support for Android 13](https://aka.ms/Intune/Android13).

The new **Password complexity** setting has the following options:

- **None**: Intune doesn't change or update this setting. By default, the OS might not require a password.
- **Low**: Pattern or PIN with repeating (4444) or ordered (1234, 4321, 2468) sequences are blocked.
- **Medium**: PIN with repeating (4444) or ordered (1234, 4321, 2468) sequences are blocked. The length, alphabetic length, or alphanumeric length must be at least four characters.
- **High**: PIN with repeating (4444) or ordered (1234, 4321, 2468) sequences are blocked. The length must be at least eight characters. The alphabetic or alphanumeric length must be at least six characters.

On Android 12+, if you currently use the **Required password type** and **Minimum password length** settings in a compliance policy or device configuration profile, then we recommend using the new **Password complexity** setting instead.

If you continue to use the **Required password type** and **Minimum password length** settings, and don't configure the **Password complexity** setting, then new devices running Android 12+ might default to the **High** password complexity.

For more information on these settings and what happens to existing devices with the deprecated settings configured, go to:

- [Android Enterprise personally owned devices with a work profile - configuration profile settings list](../configuration/device-restrictions-android-enterprise-personal.md)

You can deliver messages  just above the taskbar, in the notifications area, or in the Get Started app on Windows 11 devices.

During public preview, you can:

* Select from various preconfigured, common messages to assign to Microsoft Entra user groups.
* Add your organization's logo.
* Include a custom destination URL in the message that redirects device users to a specific place.
* Preview messages in 15 supported languages, in dark and light theme.
* Schedule a delivery window and message frequency.
* Track the status of messages and the number of views and clicks they receive. Views and clicks are aggregated by messages.
* Cancel scheduled or active messages.
* Configure a new built-in role in Intune called *Organizational Messages Manager*, which allows assigned admins to view and configure messages.

All configurations need to be done in the Microsoft Intune admin center. The Microsoft Graph API isn't available to use with organizational messages. For more information, see [Overview of organizational messages](/microsoft-365/admin/misc/organizational-messages-microsoft-365).

### App management

#### Use filters with app configuration policies for managed devices<!-- 7423842  -->
You can use filters to refine the assignment scope when deploying app configuration policies for managed devices. You must first [create a filter](filters.md#create-a-filter) using any of the available properties for iOS and Android. Then, in [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431) you can assign your managed app configuration policy by selecting **Apps** > **Configuration** > **Create** > **Managed devices** and go to the assignment page. After selecting a group, you can refine the applicability of the policy by choosing a filter and deciding to use it in **Include** or **Exclude** mode. For related information about filters, see [Use filters when assigning your apps, policies, and profiles in Microsoft Intune admin center](filters.md).

### Device configuration

#### Group Policy analytics automatically applies scope tags assigned to admins when they import Group Policy objects<!-- 16017499 -->
In Group Policy analytics, you can import your on-premises GPOs to see the policy settings that support cloud-based MDM providers, including Microsoft Intune. You can also see any deprecated settings or settings not available.

Now, scope tags assigned to admins are automatically applied when these admins import GPOs into Group Policy analytics.

For example, admins have **Charlotte**, **London**, or **Boston** scope tags assigned to their role:

- An admin with the **Charlotte** scope tag imports a GPO.
- The **Charlotte** scope tag is automatically applied to the imported GPO.
- All admins with the **Charlotte** scope tag can see the imported object.
- Admins with only the **London** or only the **Boston** scope tags can't see the imported object from the **Charlotte** admin.

For admins to see the analytics or migrate the imported GPO to an Intune policy, these admins must have one of the same scope tags as the admin that did the import.

For more information on these features, go to:

- [Analyze your on-premises GPOs using Group Policy analytics in Microsoft Intune](../configuration/group-policy-analytics.md)
- [Use role-based access control (RBAC) and scope tags for distributed IT](scope-tags.md)

### Device enrollment

#### iOS/iPadOS Setup Assistant with modern authentication supports Just in Time Registration (public preview)<!-- 15515188 -->
Intune supports just in time (JIT) Registration for iOS/iPadOS enrollment scenarios that use Setup Assistant with modern authentication. JIT Registration reduces the number of authentication prompts shown to users throughout the provisioning experience, giving them a more seamless onboarding experience. It eliminates the need to have the Company Portal app for Microsoft Entra registration and compliance checks, and establishes single sign-on across the device. JIT Registration is available in public preview for devices enrolling through Apple automated device enrollment and running iOS/iPadOS 13.0 or later. For more information, see [Authentication methods for automated device enrollment](../enrollment/automated-device-enrollment-authentication.md).

### Device management

#### Connect Chrome OS devices in Intune (public preview)<!-- 14273312 -->
View company or school-owned devices that run on Chrome OS in the Microsoft Intune admin center.  Now in public preview, you can establish a connection between the Google Admin console and Microsoft Intune admin center.  Device information about your Chrome OS endpoints is synced into Intune and viewable in your device inventory list. Basic remote actions, such as restart, wipe, and lost mode are also available in the admin center. For more information about how to set up a connection, see [Configure Chrome Enterprise connector](../enrollment/chrome-enterprise-connector-configure.md).

#### Manage macOS software updates with Intune<!-- 9801186 -->

Intune supports the following macOS update types:

- Critical updates
- Firmware updates
- Configuration file updates
- All other updates (OS, built-in apps)

In addition to scheduling when a device updates, you can manage behaviors, like:

- Download and install: Download or install the update, depending on the current state.
- Download only: Download the software update without installing it.
- Install immediately: Download the software update and trigger the restart countdown notification.
- Notify only:  Download the software update and notify the user through the App Store.
- Install later: Download the software update and install it at a later time.
- Not configured: No action taken on the software update.

For information from Apple about managing macOS software updates, see [Manage software updates for Apple devices - Apple Support](https://support.apple.com/guide/deployment/manage-software-updates-depc4c80847a/web) in the Apple's Platform Deployment documentation.

#### Deprovision Jamf Pro from within the Microsoft Intune admin center<!-- 3485465  -->
You can now [deprovision your Jamf Pro to Intune integration](../protect/conditional-access-jamf-cloud-connector.md#deprovision-jamf-pro-from-within-the-microsoft-intune-admin-center) from within the Microsoft Intune admin center. This feature can be useful should you no longer have access to the Jamf Pro console, through which you can also deprovision integration.

This capability functions similarly to disconnecting Jamf Pro from within the Jamf Pro console. So, after you remove the integration, your organization's Mac devices are removed from Intune after 90 days.

#### New hardware details available for individual devices running on iOS/iPadOS<!-- 15038076  -->
Select **Devices** > **All devices** > *select one of your listed devices* and open it's **Hardware** details. The following new details are available in the **Hardware** pane of individual devices:

- **Battery level**: Shows the battery level of the device anywhere between 0 and 100, or defaults to null if the battery level can't be determined. This feature is available for devices running iOS/iPadOS 5.0 and later.
- **Resident users**: Shows the number of users currently on the shared iPad device, or defaults to null if the number of users can't be determined. This feature is available for devices running iOS/iPadOS 13.4 and later.

For more information, go to [View device details with Microsoft Intune](../remote-actions/device-inventory.md).

Applies to

- iOS/iPadOS

#### Use the `$null` value in filters<!-- 11030128  -->
When you assign apps and policies to groups, you can use filters to assign a policy based on rules you create (**Tenant administration** > **Filters** > **Create**). These rules use different device properties, such as category or the enrollment profile.

Now, you can use the `$null` value with the `-Equals` and `-NotEquals` operators.

For example, use the `$null` value in the following scenarios:

- You want to target all devices that don't have a category assigned to the device.
- You want to target devices that don't have an enrollment profile property assigned to the device.

For more information on filters and the rules you can create, go to:

- [Use filters when assigning your apps, policies, and profiles in Microsoft Intune](filters.md)
- [Device properties, operators, and rule editing when creating filters in Microsoft Intune](filters-device-properties.md)

Applies to:

- Android device administrator
- Android Enterprise
- iOS/iPadOS
- macOS
- Windows 10/11

### Device security

#### Reusable groups of settings for removable storage in Device Control profiles (preview) <!-- 7351534 -->
In public preview, you can use [reusable groups of settings](../protect/reusable-settings-groups.md) with [device control profiles](../protect/endpoint-security-asr-policy.md#reusable-settings-groups-for-device-control-profiles) in your attack surface reduction policies.

The reusable groups for device control profiles include a collection of settings that support managing *read*, *write*, and *execute* access for removable storage. Examples of common scenarios include:

- Prevent write and execute access to all but allow specific approved USBs
- Audit write and execute access to all but block specific unapproved USBs
- Only allow specific user groups to access specific removable storage on a shared PC

Applies to:
- Windows 10 or later

#### Reusable groups of settings for Microsoft Defender Firewall Rules (preview) <!-- 5653346, 6009541 -->
In public preview, you can use [reusable groups of settings](../protect/reusable-settings-groups.md) that you can use with [profiles for Microsoft Defender Firewall Rules](../protect/endpoint-security-firewall-policy.md#add-reusable-settings-groups-to-profiles-for-firewall-rules). The reusable groups are collections of remote IP addresses and FQDNs that you define one time and can then use with one or more firewall rule profiles. You don't need to reconfigure the same group of IP addresses in each individual profile that might require them.

Features of the reusable settings groups include:

- Add one or more remote IP addresses.

- Add one or more FQDNs that can auto resolve to the remote IP address, or for one or more simple keywords when auto resolve for the group is off.

- Use each settings group with one or more firewall rule profiles and the different  profiles can support different access configurations for the group.

  For example, you can create two firewall rule profiles that reference the same reusable settings group and assign each profile to a different group of devices. The first profile can block access to all the remote IP addresses in the reusable settings group, while the second profile can be configured to allow access.

- Edits to a settings group that's in use are automatically applied to all Firewall Rules profiles that use that group.

#### Attack surface reduction rule exclusions on a per-rule basis<!-- 13385644   -->
You can now [configure per-rule exclusions for Attack surface reduction rules policies](../protect/endpoint-security-asr-policy.md#exclusions-for-attack-surface-reduction-rules). Per-rule exclusions are enabled through a new per-rule setting **ASR Only Per Rule Exclusions**.

When you create or edit attack surface reduction rule policies and change a setting that supports exclusions from the default of *Not configured* to any of the other available options, the new per-setting exclusion option becomes available. Any configurations for that setting instance of *ASR Only Per Rule Exclusions* apply to only that setting.

You can continue to configure global exclusions that apply to all attack surface reduction rules on the device
by using the setting **Attack Surface Reduction Only Exclusions**.

Applies to:

- Windows 10/11

> [!NOTE]
> ASR policies don't support merge functionality for *ASR Only Per Rule Exclusions* and a policy conflict can result when multiple policies that configure *ASR Only Per Rule Exclusions* for the same device conflict. To avoid conflicts, combine the configurations for *ASR Only Per Rule Exclusions* into a single ASR policy. We are investigating adding policy merge for *ASR Only Per Rule Exclusions* in a future update.

#### Grant apps permission to silently use certificates on Android Enterprise devices<!-- 12441244    -->
You can now configure silent use of certificates by apps on Android Enterprise devices that enrolled as **Fully Managed, Dedicated, and Corporate-Owned work Profile**.

This capability is available on a new **Apps** page in the certificate profile configuration workflow by setting **Certificate access** to  **Grant silently for specific apps (require user approval for other apps)**.  With this configuration, the apps you then select silently use the certificate. All other apps continue to use the default behavior, which is to require user approval.

This capability supports the following certificate profiles for only Android Enterprise Fully Managed, Dedicated, and Corporate-Owned work Profiles:

- [Derived credentials](../protect/derived-credentials.md#use-derived-credentials-for-app-authentication)
- [Imported PKCS](../protect/certificates-imported-pfx-configure.md#create-a-pkcs-imported-certificate-profile)
- [PKCS](../protect/certificates-pfx-configure.md#create-a-pkcs-certificate-profile)
- [SCEP](../protect/certificates-profile-scep.md#create-a-scep-certificate-profile)

#### In-app notifications for Microsoft Intune app<!-- 13110609  -->
Android Open Source Project(AOSP) device users can now receive compliance notifications in the Microsoft Intune app. This capability is only available on AOSP user-based devices. For more information, see [AOSP compliance notifications](../user-help/check-compliance-aosp.md#compliance-notifications).

### Intune apps
