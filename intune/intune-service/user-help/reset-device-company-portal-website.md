# Reset device from Company Portal website

**Applies to**:     
* iOS/iPadOS    
* Windows 10
* Windows 11

Remotely reset a used, lost, or stolen device to factory default settings. A *reset* deletes all apps, settings, and personal data on the device, unenrolls the device, and removes it from the Company Portal apps and website.  

## Supported devices  

You can reset the following types of devices from the Company Portal website: 

* iOS/iPadOS devices that aren't supervised   
* Devices running Windows 10 or Windows 11  

The action may be unavailable on devices that your organization owns and lends out for use. If you're an IT support person and want to find out more about device reset and its limitations, see [Remove devices by using wipe, retire, or manually unenrolling the device](../remote-actions/devices-wipe.md).  

## Reset device  
To reset a device to its original, out-of-box settings: 

1. On any device, sign in to [the Company Portal website](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2010980) with your work or school account. 
1. Go to the menu and select **Devices**.  
1. Select the device you want to reset.  
1. Select **Reset**.  

    >[!TIP]
    > If the reset option isn't visible at the top of your page, select the **More (â€¦)** menu to see all overflow actions.  

1. A message warns you that you're about to erase all data on your device, and reset the device to its factory default settings. Tap **Reset** to confirm.
