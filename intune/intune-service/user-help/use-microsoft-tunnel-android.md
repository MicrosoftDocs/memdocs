# Using Microsoft Tunnel for Android

Microsoft Tunnel uses Microsoft Defender for Endpoint as The Microsoft Tunnel client app on Android.

The Microsoft Tunnel client app helps you securely and privately connect to your corporate network over a VPN. If your organization requires you to use the app, they already configured a VPN connection for your work account. To connect to the VPN, simply install the app and sign in with your work account.

## Install Microsoft Tunnel

Microsoft Defender for Endpoint is available in the Google Play store. Before heading there, check your device to see if it's already installed.

If you canâ€™t find the app in the Play store, contact your IT support person for help.  

## Connect and disconnect from VPN  

1. Open Microsoft Defender for Endpoint.
2. Sign in with your work account if prompted.
3. On the **Tunnel** screen, turn the **Status** toggle on or off to connect or disconnect from the VPN. 

Your organization might require you to stay connected to Microsoft Tunnel. This is known as an *always-on* connection. If this is the case, the Status toggle will appear inactive, and you won't be able to disconnect from the VPN as long as you're connected to the internet. 

If the toggle is stuck in the off position, select **Help** > **Send logs** and report the problem to your IT support person. For more details, see the [Send logs](use-microsoft-tunnel-android.md#send-logs) section in this article.  

## Connection details

The following information appears on the **Connect** screen when Tunnel is connected.  

* **Uptime**: How long the VPN connection has been running. 

* **Data received**: How much data has been received through the VPN connection. 

* **Data sent**: How much data has been sent through the VPN connection.  

Tap **Details** to see the following information:  

* **Address**: The server address for your VPN connection. 

* **Device-wide connection**: When turned on, all network traffic to and from your device goes through the VPN connection.

* **Apps that use Tunnel**: If apps are listed, only network traffic to and from these apps go through the VPN connection.

* **Always-on**: When turned on, Microsoft Defender for Endpoint will continuously try to establish a connection.

## App settings  

From the **Connect** screen, select the **Settings** gear icon to:

* Allow/block Microsoft from collecting usage and performance data.
* Turn verbose logging on/off.

## Get help in the app

Select **Help** from the menu at the bottom of the screen to:  

* Access this article.  
* Send logs to IT support to report a problem.  

### Send logs

Send app logs to IT support to get help with an app or connection problem.

1. Select **Help** > **Send logs**.
2. Select **Send logs** again. Your logs will be sent to a Microsoft database, from which your organization can access.
3. Select **EMAIL IT SUPPORT**.
4. On the Share screen, select your mail app.
5. In the body of the email, describe the problem you experienced so that the support team has an idea of what to look for.
6. Send the email.
