# Sync AOSP device with Intune  

 A manual sync forces your device to connect with Intune to get the latest updates, requirements, and communications from your organization. The Microsoft Intune app regularly syncs devices as long as you're connected to Wi-Fi. If you've been disconnected from Wi-Fi for an extended period of time, you can use the manual sync feature to get any policies and updates you missed.  

## Sync device  
To force a sync:    

1. Sign in to the Intune app. 
2. Tap the menu. 
3. Tap **Settings**.  
4. Go to **Security policy sync** and tap **Sync**. 

## Sync versus Refresh

The Company Portal **Sync** feature is different from the **Refresh** feature. *Refresh* your device to check device compliance and verify that your settings meet your organization's requirements. For more information, see [Check device compliance for AOSP](check-compliance-aosp.md).
