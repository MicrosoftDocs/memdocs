# Check status on Intune Company Portal website  


**Applies to:** 
* Android  
* iOS/iPadOS   
* macOS   
* Windows 10/11     

Remotely check the status of a device from the Company Portal website. During a status check, Company Portal assesses the selected device to determine whether or not it has work access. 

## Check status  
To check the status of a device:  

1. Sign in to the [Company Portal website](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2010980).  

2. Go to **Devices**, and then select your device.  

3. Under **Status**, select **Check status**. Wait while Company Portal checks your device.  

## Device status    

After the check, the status updates to show the most current state of your device. 

* **Can access**: Your device is allowed to access work or school resources.  
* **Out of compliance - can still access company resources**: Your device is allowed to access work or school resources, but one or more settings don't meet your organization's requirements. Update your device settings by the date shown to keep your access.  
* **Cannot access company resources**: Your device isn't allowed to access work or school resources. Make the required changes to gain access.  

The specific requirements and next steps are determined by your organization's policies. If you're required to make any changes to your device, Company Portal will include that information next to the device status.
