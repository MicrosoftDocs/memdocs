# Reset device in Company Portal app for Android   

Use the Company Portal app for Android to reset a used, lost, or stolen device back to factory settings. All apps, settings, and personal data on the device will be deleted and the device will no longer appear in Company Portal.  

The reset option may not be available for every device that appears in Company Portal. Your organization can choose to hide the option.  


## Factory reset device  
To reset a device to its original, out-of-box settings:   

1. Open the Company Portal app on any managed device and sign in with your work or school account.
2. Select **DEVICES**. 
3. Select the device you want to reset.
4. Select the menu button > **Factory Reset**.  
5. Select **RESET** to start wiping the device.   


## Remove work content and access on Knox device 
If you're on a Samsung Knox device, you can use the device removal option to remove all work-related content from your device. This option deletes:  

- School or work-related apps connected to your organization. 
- Work-related email, VPN, and Wi-Fi configurations.  

In addition, your IT support person will no longer be able to enforce certain settings on your device.
