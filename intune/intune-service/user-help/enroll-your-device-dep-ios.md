# Set up work or school access on company device   

**Applies to iOS/iPadOS**  

Set up and register a work or school-provided device so that you can access Wi-Fi, files, and apps for work. This article describes the steps and screens you'll see as you walk through Setup Assistant. 

To set up a personal device for work, see [set up personal and bring-your-own devices](enroll-your-device-in-intune-ios.md).    

## Set up your iOS/iPadOS device
1. Turn on your device.
2. Select your **Language**. 
3. Connect your device to Wi-Fi.
3. On the **Set up iOS device** screen, choose **Set up as new device**.  
4. When prompted to, sign with your Apple ID. 
6. Agree to the **Terms and Conditions**. Decide whether you want to send diagnostic information to Apple.  
7. Update any required device settings if prompted.  

Work or school access is granted after enrollment and after your device meets all setting and compliance requirements enforced by your organization.
