# Turn off Microsoft data collection on Windows device

This article describes how to prevent Microsoft from collecting data about your Company Portal app usage. To turn off data collection in Company Portal:

1. Open the Company Portal app and go to **Settings**.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Example screenshot of the Company Portal app homepage, highlighting the Settings option.](./media/sync-your-device-manually-windows/company-portal-windows-settings.png)

1. Under **Usage data**, switch the toggle to **No**.

   > ![Example screenshot of the Company Portal app settings page, highlighting the usage data toggle that's set to "No".](./media/turn-off-microsoft-usage-data-collection-windows/company-portal-windows-usage-data.png)

## Allowing Microsoft data collection

When set to **Yes**, your in-app performance and usage data is automatically collected and shared with Microsoft. This type of data helps us improve the reliability and performance of Microsoft products. If you disable the usage data collection, your organization cannot change your preferences.

For more information about the data we collect, see [Optional diagnostic data from Intune Client apps](../protect/client-apps-optional-data.md).
