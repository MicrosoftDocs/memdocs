# Set up iOS or iPadOS device with Company Portal and DISA Purebred  

Enroll your device with the Intune Company Portal app to gain secure, mobile access to your organization's email, files, and apps. After your device is enrolled, it becomes *managed*. Your organization can assign policies and apps to the device through a mobile device management (MDM) provider, such as Intune.  

During enrollment, you'll also install a derived credential on your device. Your organization might require you to use the derived credential as an authentication method when accessing resources, or for signing and encrypting emails. 

You likely need to set up a derived credential if you use a smart card to:

* Sign in to school or work apps, Wi-Fi, and virtual private networks (VPN).  
* Sign and encrypt school or work emails using S/MIME certificates.  

In this article, you will:  

   * Enroll a mobile iOS or iPadOS device with Intune Company Portal.  
   * Get a derived credential from your organization's derived credential provider, [DISA Purebred](https:\//cyber.mil/pki-pke/purebred/).  

## What are derived credentials?  
A derived credential is a certificate that's derived from your smart card credentials and installed on your device. It grants you remote access to work resources, while preventing unauthorized users from accessing sensitive information.  

Derived credentials are used to: 
* Authenticate students and employees who sign in to school or work apps, Wi-Fi, and VPN.  
* Sign and encrypt school or work emails with S/MIME certificates.  

Derived credentials are an implementation of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) guidelines for Derived Personal Identity Verification (PIV) credentials as part of Special Publication (SP) 800-157.  

## Prerequisites

 To complete enrollment, you must have:

* Your school or work-provided smart card
* Access to a computer or kiosk where you can sign in with your smart card
* Your mobile device
* The Intune Company Portal app for iOS and iPadOS installed on your device   

You'll also need to contact a Purebred agent or representative during setup.  

## Step 1: Enroll device  
1. Open the Company Portal app for iOS/iPadOS on your mobile device and sign in with your work account.  

1. Write down the onscreen code.  

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Example image of Company Portal app with onscreen message and code.](./media/enroll-ios-device-intercede/copy-code-intercede.png)  

1. Switch to your smart card-enabled device and go to https://microsoft.com/devicelogin. If you're a government employee signing in from another device, you'll need to change the settings on your device so that you're redirected to the government cloud for authentication. For more information about the setting changes you need to make, see [Troubleshoot iOS/iPadOS enrollment errors](/troubleshoot/mem/intune/device-enrollment/troubleshoot-ios-enrollment-errors#authentication-doesnt-redirect-to-the-government-cloud).  
1. Enter the code you previously wrote down.  
1. Insert your smart card to sign in.  
1. Return to the Company Portal app on your mobile device and follow the onscreen instructions to enroll your device.  
1. After enrollment is complete, Company Portal will notify you to set up your smart card. Tap the notification. If you don't get a notification, check your email.
