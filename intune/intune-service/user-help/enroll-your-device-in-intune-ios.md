> [!NOTE]
> If you tried to access your work email in the Mail app, and received a prompt to get your device managed, you're in the right place. Follow the instructions in this article to regain access to your email and other work resources on your iOS device.   

## Account driven user enrollment    
Initiate enrollment in the Settings app by signing in with your work or school account, or organization-provided Apple ID. After you approve remote management, the enrollment profile silently installs and your organization's Intune policies apply, enabling you to sign in to apps such as Microsoft Teams and Microsoft Outlook with your work account. For this process, you need: 

- Safari web browser  
- iOS/iPadOS version 15 or later  
- Stable Wi-Fi connection  

If this method is unavailable on your device, enroll your device with the Company Portal app or via web enrollment.    

1. Open the Settings app on your device.  

1. Go to **General** > **VPN & Device Management**.  

1. Tap the option to sign in with your work or school account. Sign in with your work or school account, or with the Apple ID provided to you by your organization.  

1. Sign in to iCloud. Enter the password for the username that appears onscreen. Then select **Continue**.  

1. Tap **Allow Remote Management**.      

1. Wait a few minutes while your device is configured and the configuration profile is installed.  

1. To confirm your device is ready to use for work, return to **VPN & Device Management** in your Settings app. Confirm that your work account is listed as a managed account.  

1. Microsoft Authenticator is required to access work apps. Wait a few minutes after enrollment for Authenticator to install on your device. An error message appears if you try to sign in to a work app without Authenticator.  

1. Approve other work apps, as necessary. As you receive each prompt, select **Install** to approve its installation. 

1. Sign in to a work app, such as Microsoft Teams, with your work or school account. The first time you sign in, your device will be checked to ensure it meets your organization's device and security policies. If your device is compliant, you can access your work account. If not, you receive a prompt to update your device settings.


## Device enrollment with Company Portal app  

Initiate enrollment in the Intune Company Portal app. The Company Portal app is used to enroll and manage your device, install work apps, and get IT support. The app supports devices running iOS 14.0 and later.   Maintain a Wi-Fi connection until all steps are complete. Pausing for more than a few minutes during device enrollment might cause the Company Portal app to close or end setup. If this happens, reopen the app and try again.

1. Go to a work app like Microsoft Teams or Microsoft Outlook and sign in with your work or school account to confirm that you have access.  
    1. If access is limited due to compliance requirements, you receive an in-app prompt upon sign-in. Tap **Check compliance** to open Company Portal and review pending notifications and requirements.
