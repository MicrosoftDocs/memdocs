# Remotely lock your device from the Company Portal website

**Applies to** 
* Android   
* iOS/iPadOS     

Remotely lock the screen of a lost or stolen enrolled device. The *remote lock* action is available on the Intune Company Portal website and can be used on supported devices. After you lock a device, it will stay locked until someone finds it and enters the correct passcode. 

## Lock a device  

1. On any device, sign in to the [Company Portal website](https://portal.manage.microsoft.com) with your work or school account.  
1. Go to __Devices__.    
1. Select the device you want to lock.  
1. Select **Remote lock**. If the lock option isn't visible at the top of your page, select the **More (â€¦)** menu to check all overflow actions. 
1. A message appears to warn you that you are about to lock your device. Tap **Remote lock** to confirm.  

## Check remote lock status  

While the Company Portal attempts to lock your device, you'll see a **Remote lock pending** status. When your device finally locks, the status changes to **Remote lock successful**. The status appears throughout the website in your notifications area and on device=specific pages.   

> [!TIP]
> If you see a notification that the remote lock failed, wait a few minutes, and then try to lock your device again. The status will change back to **Remote lock pending**. If the retry doesn't work, contact your support person for help.
