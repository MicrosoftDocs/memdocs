# Turn off Microsoft data collection on Android device  

This article describes how to prevent Microsoft from collecting data about your Microsoft Intune or Company Portal usage. To turn off data collection in these apps:  

1. Open the Microsoft Intune or Company Portal app on your Android device.  
2. Select the menu button > **Settings**.
3. Switch the **Usage Data** toggle to the off position.       

## Allowing Microsoft data collection   

When usage data is turned on, Company Portal shares app performance and usage data with Microsoft. Usage data is shared anonymously. This type of data helps us improve the reliability and performance of Microsoft products. Your organization doesn't have control over the collection of this data and cannot change your preferences.    

## Next steps
