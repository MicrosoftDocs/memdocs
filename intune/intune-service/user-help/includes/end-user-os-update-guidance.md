  > Keeping your device up-to-date lets you access the newest features, and it also ensures that your device has the most secure version of its operating system. Microsoft and most major vendors generally recommend keeping both personal and corporate devices on the newest versions of software available to you.

Before updating your device, be sure that you have backed up all of the information on it. Keeping a backup can help you recover your data if something should interrupt any updates, or lets you transfer your information to a replacement device.
