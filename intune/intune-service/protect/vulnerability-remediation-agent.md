# Vulnerability Remediation Agent for Security Copilot in Microsoft Intune

> [!NOTE]
> The Vulnerability Remediation Agent is currently in a limited public preview and available to only a select group of customers. If you’re interested in gaining access or would like to learn more, please reach out to your sales team for further details and next steps.

In public preview, the Vulnerability Remediation Agent for Security Copilot in Intune uses data from [Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management](/defender-vulnerability-management/defender-vulnerability-management) to identify Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) on your managed devices. The results are prioritized for remediation and include step-by-step instructions to guide you in using Intune to remediate the threat. This Copilot Agent can help you reduce the time it takes to investigate, identify, and remediate threats, ultimately improving your organization’s overall security posture.

When the agent runs, it analyzes data from Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management and provides a prioritized list of suggestions that appear in the Intune admin center. You can drill-in to each suggestion to view details that include:

- The count of associated vulnerabilities (CVEs)
- A Copilot-assisted summarized impact analysis
- Suggested actions
- Affected systems
- Exposed devices
- Potential impact
- Step-by-step guidance for using Intune to remediate it

Once you remediate an agent suggestion, you can mark it as applied to have the agent retain a record you can use in tracking remediation actions over time.

Because CVE details and recommended remediation guidance can change over time, subsequent runs of the agent might provide new details, device counts, and remediation steps. As you manage subsequent reports of threats, the record of your previously applied solutions can help you track the change to specific risks based on your previous remediations.

For information about other Security Copilot Agents in Intune and common features, see [Security Copilot agents in Microsoft Intune](../copilot/security-copilot-agents-intune.md).

## Prerequisites

### Licensing and plugins

- [**Microsoft Intune Plan 1 subscription**](../fundamentals/licenses.md) - This subscription provides the core Intune capabilities.

- [**Microsoft Security Copilot**](/copilot/security/microsoft-security-copilot) - Security Copilot must share a Tenant with Intune, and to set up the agent your account must have permission to the workspace for Security Copilot. For more information, see [Get started with Microsoft Security Copilot](/copilot/security/get-started-security-copilot#onboarding-to-security-copilot).

- [**Security compute units (SCU)**](/copilot/security/manage-usage) - You must have sufficient SCUs to power Security Copilot workloads, including agents.

- [**Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management**](/defender-vulnerability-management/defender-vulnerability-management) - This capability is provided by Microsoft Defender for Endpoint P2 or Defender Vulnerability Management Standalone.

### Government cloud support

The current release of the Vulnerability Remediation Agent is supported on the public cloud but isn't supported on government clouds.

### Supported applications and platforms

The Vulnerability Remediation Agent supports evaluation and recommendations for the following applications and platforms:

- Windows 10
- Windows 11
- Apps in Intune

### Role-based access control

For an Intune administrator (admin) to successfully manage or use the Vulnerability Remediation Agent, they must be assigned the role-based access controls (RBAC) for Intune, Microsoft Defender, and Security Copilot as described in the following sections.

When assigning RBAC roles and permissions to admins to manage and use the agent, assign the least privileged built-in RBAC role or a custom role that includes the minimum permissions ￼required to complete their administrative tasks.

| Action | Microsoft Intune | Microsoft Defender | Security Copilot |
|--------|------------------|--------------------|------------------|
| **Set Up and Removal**        | Admin must be assigned an Intune license. Permissions (built-in or custom role) must include: <br><br> - Managed apps/read <br> - Mobile apps/read <br> - Device configurations/read <br><br>Least privileged Intune built-in role: [Read Only Operator](../fundamentals/role-based-access-control-reference.md#read-only-operator). | The admin must have permissions equal to the Microsoft Entra [Security reader](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#security-reader) role. | The admin must be a [Copilot **owner**](/copilot/security/authentication). |
| **Work with Installed Agent** | Admin must be assigned an Intune license. Permissions (built-in or custom role) must include: <br><br> - Managed apps/read <br> - Mobile apps/read <br> - Device configurations/read <br><br>Least privileged Intune built-in role: [Read Only Operator](../fundamentals/role-based-access-control-reference.md#read-only-operator). | The admin must have permissions equal to the Microsoft Entra [Security reader](/defender-endpoint/prepare-deployment#role-based-access-control) role. | The admin must be a [Copilot **contributor**](/copilot/security/authentication). |

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> The Vulnerability Remediation Agent runs under the identity and permissions of the admin who set up the agent. During public preview, the identity can't be edited. To change this identity, the agent must be removed and set up again.
>
> Data that is reported by the agent and visible through agent suggestions might be visible to admins with access to view the agent within the Intune admin center, even when that data is outside the admins assigned Intune roles or scope.

### Limitations

- An admin must manually start the agent. Once the agent starts, there are no options to stop or pause it.
- The agent persistently runs in the identity and permissions of the Intune admin who initially set up the agent. This identity refreshes with each agent run and expires if the agent has not been run for 90 consecutive days. There is no notification regarding the end of the authorized period. To reauthorize the agent, it must be [removed](#remove-the-agent) and then [set up](#getting-started) again.
- Only start the agent from within the Microsoft Intune admin center.
- Associated CVEs contain the count of CVEs on devices with Windows 10 and 11 client operating system editions but excludes devices with Windows Server Editions. CVEs are classified by Low, Medium, High, and Critical according to the CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System) scale.
- Exposed device list includes only devices found in Microsoft Entra, and that aren't Windows Server editions.
- Agent doesn't support scope tags in public preview.
- Only the user who sets up the agent can view session details in the Microsoft Security Copilot portal.

## Getting started

Complete the setup process to start the Vulnerability Remediation Agent for the first time: 

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431) with an account that has the required [RBAC permissions](#role-based-access-control) and access to your tenants Security Copilot workspace.

2. On the **Home** screen of the admin center, find the **Get started with Security Copilot** banner and select the **Vulnerability Remediation Agent (preview)** tile. The admin center opens the *Endpoint security* > *Vulnerability Remediation Agent (preview)* page:

   :::image type="content" source="./media/vulnerability-remediation-agent/agent-set-up.png" alt-text="A screenshot that displays the Intune admin center home page with the Vulnerability Remediation Agent tile.":::

3. Select **Set up Agent** to open the set-up pane. This pane displays details about the agent but doesn’t require any configuration. Review the details to ensure requirements are in place, and then select **Start agent** to close the set-up pane and start the first run of the agent.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/vulnerability-remediation-agent/set-up-and-start-agent.png" alt-text="A screenshot that displays the Set up Vulnerability Remediation Agent page and the Start agent button.":::

The agent runs until it finishes and then displays its results in the Vulnerability Remediation Agent pane of the admin center.

## Manage vulnerabilities and the agent

After the agent completes its initial run, admins can review and manage the Vulnerability Remediation Agent suggestions In the [Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431). Go to **Endpoint security** > **Vulnerability Remediation Agent (preview)**. By default, the agent page opens to the [Overview](#overview-tab) tab. On this tab admins can view the prioritized list of vulnerabilities, drill in for more details and remediation steps, and view the agent run history. 

The other available tab is [Settings](#settings-tab) tab, which provides limited details about the agent’s configuration. 

:::image type="content" source="./media/vulnerability-remediation-agent/agent-home-screen.png" alt-text="A screenshot that displays the Remediation Agent home page in the admin center.":::

### Overview tab

After the Vulnerability Remediation Agent completes a run, the Overview tab updates with the agents prioritized list of top vulnerabilities.

The following information is available on this tab:

- The agent’s availability and run status
- Agent suggestions, which are the prioritized list of vulnerabilities. 
- The list of past agent activity.

#### Agent suggestions

Agent suggestions are a prioritized list of the top vulnerabilities identified based on the data from [Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management](/defender-vulnerability-management/defender-vulnerability-management). This information can differ slightly from the same information you can view in the Microsoft Defender console.

This list also displays the following column details:

- **Suggested next steps:** Each *suggested next step* is a link that opens a *Suggested action* pane. On the *Suggested action* pane are details about the associated vulnerabilities (for Intune managed devices), suggested actions to take to remediate the threat, and an option to mark the remediation as *Applied*. 

  Remediation guidance falls into the following categories:

  - **Apps** - To remediate apps the agent might recommend deployment of an updated app, or of an Intune profile to help manage what the app can do or be used to do that represents a threat.
  - **Windows** – To remediate Windows vulnerabilities, common recommendations include deployment of a quality update policy or the expedited deployment of a quality update policy using Windows update rings to resolve the threat.

    When a recommendation involves a Windows update, the agent guidance includes details about the use of [update rings](../protect/windows-10-update-rings.md) to help manage a more controlled rollout of the update.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > Some suggested Windows updates recommendations begin with **Expedite**. The agent uses this format when the CVE’s Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) score reaches a risk value of **9.0** or greater. For this level of risk, the agent recommends expediting these updates to your devices immediately. To help you deploy these more critical updates, the guidance includes how to use [Expedited installation of quality updates](../protect/windows-10-expedite-updates.md), to more rapidly deploy the recommended update.

  The following image is an example of the *Suggested action* pane for an App vulnerability. In this example, the recommendation is to update the app to a newer version:

  :::image type="content" source="./media/vulnerability-remediation-agent/suggested-action-pane.png" alt-text="A screenshot that displays the Suggested actions for an App vulnerability.":::

  After reviewing agent suggestions and applying a recommended remediation, admins can self-attest to applying those remediations by selecting **Mark as applied**. This action confirms that the remediation steps are complete. Marking a suggestion as applied doesn’t trigger any device changes by the agent but does add a timestamp called *Last marked as applied* to the suggestion that identifies the time of that attestation.

  With subsequent runs of the agent, suggestions might be updated. If the previous suggestion was marked as applied, admins can self-attest to having applied the more recent suggestions by selecting **Make update as applied**. This action updates the *Last marked as applied* timestamp to the current time.

  While optional, marking a suggested action as applied helps track when a suggested remediation was implemented. Recommendations marked as applied persist in the agent suggestions list, serving as a baseline for future runs of the agent, allowing you to compare new results and changes for that same vulnerability.

- **Impact:** This value is the potential impact the [exposure score](/defender-vulnerability-management/tvm-exposure-score) as identified by Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management.

- **Exposed devices:** The count of affected devices. The associated CVEs number count shown by the agent is only for devices with Windows 10 and Windows 11 client operating system editions and doesn't include server editions. The devices listed in the Export to .csv removes any devices not found in Microsoft Entra.

  > [!TIP]
  > The agent does not support scope tags during the public preview.

- **Status:** By default, a reported vulnerability has its status set to *Not applied*. An admin can drill into a reported vulnerability to review and deploy the suggested remediation, and then select the option to mark that suggestion as applied, which changes the status of the agent’s suggestion to *Applied*. *Mark as applied* confirms that an admin has attested to having completed the remediation steps. No action is taken on devices by the agent.

- **Last applied:** This value identifies the date and time that an admin selected the option to mark the remediation guidance as applied.

#### Activity

This section tracks the current and past run activity of the agent. When the agent is still actively running, the Status column displays *Run in progress*. The status column displays *Complete* for past agent runs.

### Settings tab

On the Vulnerability Remediation Agent **Settings** tab, admins can view the existing details about the current configuration of the agent. During the public preview, there are no edits or changes that can be made.

### Run the agent

To start and run the Vulnerability Remediation Agent, in the [Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431), go to **Endpoint security** > **Vulnerability Remediation Agent (preview)** and select **Run**. This option isn’t available until after the agent is [set-up](#getting-started) and completes its first run.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The agent runs under the identity and permissions of the user who enabled it within your tenant. This identity refreshes with each agent run and expires if the agent has not been run for 90 consecutive days. There is no notification regarding the end of the authorized period.

The Vulnerability Remediation Agent doesn’t support a recurring schedule and must be started manually.

Once started, the agent runs until it completes its evaluation. It can’t be stopped or paused.  

### Renew the agent  
If the agent remains unused for 90 days and its identity approaches expiration, you will receive a notification you about the end of the authorized period. The Copilot owner receives a prompt to renew the agent identity on the agent overview page. To reauthorize the agent identity, select **Renew authorization**. After renewal, the warning banner disappears, and a toast notification appears to validate that everything completed successfully. 

>[!IMPORTANT]
> When renewing permissions, the agent uses the credentials of the individual who selects **Renew authorization**.  

### Remove the agent

To remove the Vulnerability Remediation Agent, in the [Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431) , go to **Endpoint security** > **Vulnerability Remediation Agent (preview)** and select **Remove agent**. After an admin accepts the prompt, the agent is removed, and the agent pane is restored to its original state.

> [!NOTE]
> To remove the agent instance, the admin account must have the *Owner* role in Security Copilot. An account with the *Contributor* role can run the agent and view results but can't manage the agent instance.

> [!WARNING]
> When an agent is removed, all existing agent suggestions are deleted. This includes details about suggestions that were marked as *Applied*.

Later, an admin can run through the agent [set-up](#getting-started) to reinstall it.

## Vulnerability Remediation Agent logs

During the public preview, there are limited logs available for the agent.

All agent management, create, delete, run, and any permission failures are available in [Security Copilot logs](/copilot/security/audit-log).
Logging of discovered vulnerabilities or when a remediation was applied aren't available. Instead, use the options to mark a remediated vulnerability as *Applied*.

## Frequently asked questions (FAQs)

**Details:** You aren’t part of the workspace needed to access this agent.

This message indicates that your account doesn't have permission to view or use the [Security Copilot workspace](/copilot/security/workspaces-overview), which is configured at the time Security Copilot is added to your Tenant. Contact the administrator who installed or manages your Security Copilot subscription for assistance in gaining access, and see [Understand authentication in Microsoft Security Copilot](/copilot/security/authentication).

### Error: You don’t have access to this agent – Permissions

**Details:** You don’t have the permissions needed to access this agent.

Review the prerequisites for the [role-based access control](#role-based-access-control) permission required to use this agent. Work with an Intune Administrator to assign your account the required permissions. 

### Error: The agent encountered an error and did not finish the run. Try running the agent again. 

**Details:** The agent instance failed to start or successfully complete its run. Details of the failure cannot be identified. Despite failing to run or complete, admins can continue to view and manage the agent suggestions from past runs.

If the agent continues to fail, it is possible that it’s lost authorization for its identity account and won't be able to run until it’s reauthorized. Possible reasons for a loss of authorization include but are not limited to:

- The agent’s authorization period of 90 days has been reached. 
- The user account that the agent was installed with is subject to a policy that requires periodic reauthentication.
- An access token has been revoked.

During the public preview, agent reauthorization requires that the agent be removed and then set up again.
