# Configure Microsoft Intune for Zero Trust: Secure tenants (Preview)

Protecting your Intune tenant is essential to enforcing Zero Trust principles and maintaining a secure, well-managed environment. These recommendations align with Microsoftâ€™s [Secure Future Initiative](https://www.microsoft.com/trust-center/security/secure-future-initiative?msockid=2bad2df65a416adb0e5838355b3e6b95#SFI-pillars) by limiting blast radius and enforcing least-privilege access through segmented administrative control, secure device onboarding, and policy-driven protections. Together, they help reduce risk, maintain tenant hygiene, and strengthen compliance across platforms.
