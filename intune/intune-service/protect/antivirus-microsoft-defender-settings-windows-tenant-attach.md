# Settings for Microsoft Defender Antivirus policy for tenant attached devices in Microsoft Intune

View the Microsoft Defender Antivirus settings you can manage with the **Microsoft Defender Antivirus Policy (ConfigMgr)** profile from Intune. The profile is available when you configure Intune [Endpoint security Antivirus policy](../protect/endpoint-security-antivirus-policy.md), and the policy deploys to devices you manage with Configuration Manager when you've configured the [tenant attach](../protect/tenant-attach-intune.md) scenario. (Path in the Microsoft Intune admin center: *Endpoint security* > *Antivirus* > *+ Create Policy* > Platform = *Windows (ConfigMgr)* > Profile = *Microsoft Defender Antivirus*.)

## Cloud protection

- **Turn on cloud-delivered protection**  
  CSP: [AllowCloudProtection](/windows/client-management/mdm/policy-csp-defender#defender-allowcloudprotection)

  By default, Defender on Windows 10/11 desktop devices sends information to Microsoft about any problems it finds. Microsoft analyzes that information to learn more about problems affecting you and other customers, to offer improved solutions.

  - **Not Configured** (*default*) - The setting is restored to the system default.
  - **No** Turns off the Microsoft Active Protection Service.
  - **Yes**  Turns on the Microsoft Active Protection Service.

- **Cloud-delivered protection level**  
  CSP: [CloudBlockLevel](/windows/client-management/mdm/policy-csp-defender#defender-cloudblocklevel)

  Configure how aggressive Defender Antivirus is in blocking and scanning suspicious files.

- **Defender Cloud Extended Timeout in Seconds**  
  CSP: [CloudExtendedTimeout](/windows/client-management/mdm/policy-csp-defender#defender-cloudextendedtimeout)

  Defender Antivirus automatically blocks suspicious files for 10 seconds so it can scan the files in the cloud to make sure they're safe. With this setting, you can add up to 50 more seconds to this timeout.

## Microsoft Defender Antivirus Exclusions

> [!WARNING]
> **Defining exclusions lowers the protection offered by Microsoft Defender Antivirus**. Always evaluate the risks that are associated with implementing exclusions. Only exclude files you know aren't malicious.
