# Configure Microsoft Intune for Zero Trust: Secure data on devices (Preview)

Protecting sensitive data across mobile apps and networks is a key part of a Zero Trust strategy. The following Intune recommendations reflect Microsoftâ€™s [Secure Future Initiative](https://www.microsoft.com/trust-center/security/secure-future-initiative?msockid=2bad2df65a416adb0e5838355b3e6b95#SFI-pillars) by enforcing secure access, safeguarding information, and reducing risk across platforms. These checks help keep business data safe by applying app protections, ensuring device compliance, and securing connections to corporate networks.
