# Firewall policy settings for endpoint security in Intune

View the settings you can configure in profiles for *Firewall* policy in the endpoint security node of Intune as part of an [Endpoint security policy](../protect/endpoint-security-policy.md).

Applies to:

- macOS
- Windows 10
- Windows 11

> [!NOTE]
>
> Beginning on April 5, 2022, the Firewall profiles for the *Windows 10 and later* platform were replaced by the *Windows* platform and new instances of those same profiles. Profiles created after that date use a new settings format as found in the Settings Catalog. With this change you can no longer create new versions of the old profile and they are no longer being developed. Although you can no longer create new instances of the older profile, you can continue to edit and use instances of it that you previously created.
>
> For profiles that use the new settings format, Intune no longer maintains a list of each setting by name. Instead, the name of each setting, its configuration options, and its explanatory text you see in the Microsoft Intune admin center are taken directly from the settings authoritative content. That content can provide more information about the use of the setting in its proper context. When viewing a settings information text, you can use its *Learn more* link to open that content.
>
> The settings details for Windows profiles in this article apply to those deprecated profiles.

Supported platforms and profiles:

- **macOS**:
  - Profile: **macOS firewall**

- **Windows 10 and later**:
  - Profile: **Windows Firewall**

## macOS firewall profile

### Firewall

The following settings are configured as [Endpoint Security policy for macOS Firewalls](../protect/endpoint-security-firewall-policy.md)

- **Enable Firewall**

  - **Not configured** (*default*)
  - **Yes** - Enable the firewall.
  
  When set to *Yes*, you can configure the following settings.

  - **Block all incoming connections**

    - **Not configured** (*default*)

  - **Enable stealth mode**

    - **Not configured** (*default*)
    - **Yes** - Prevent the computer from responding to probing requests. The computer still answers incoming requests for authorized apps.

  - **Firewall apps**
    Expand the dropdown and then select **Add** to then specify apps and rules for incoming connections for the app.
    - **Allow incoming connections**
      - Not configured
      - Block
      - Allow

    - **Bundle ID** - The ID identifies the app. For example: *com.apple.app*

- **Preshared key encoding**  
  CSP: [MdmStore/Global/PresharedKeyEncoding](/windows/client-management/mdm/firewall-csp#presharedkeyencoding)

  CSP: [FirewallRules/FirewallRuleName/App/FilePath](/windows/client-management/mdm/firewall-csp#filepath)

  To specify the file path of an app, enter the apps location on the client device. For example: `C:\Windows\System\Notepad.exe`

- **Service name**  
  [FirewallRules/FirewallRuleName/App/ServiceName](/windows/client-management/mdm/firewall-csp#servicename)

  Use a Windows service short name when a service, not an application, is sending or receiving traffic. Service short names are retrieved by running the `Get-Service` command from PowerShell.
