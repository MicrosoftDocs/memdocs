Without a properly configured and assigned BitLocker policy in Intune, threat actors can exploit unencrypted Windows devices to gain unauthorized access to sensitive corporate data. Devices that lack enforced encryption are vulnerable to physical attacks, like disk removal or booting from external media, allowing attackers to bypass operating system security controls. These attacks can result in data exfiltration, credential theft, and further lateral movement within the environment. Enforcing BitLocker across all managed Windows devices is critical for compliance with data protection regulations and for reducing the risk of data breaches.
