Centrally managing corporate Wi-Fi network for iOS devices through Microsoft Intune ensures that all corporate devices connect securely and consistently to enterprise wireless networks. This approach enforces security standards like WPA/WPA2 Enterprise, simplifies onboarding, and reduces the risk of misconfiguration or unauthorized access. If Wi-Fi profiles aren't properly configured and assigned, users might be unable to connect to secure networks, or can connect insecurely, exposing corporate data to interception or unauthorized access.

**Remediation action**

- [Add and use Wi-Fi settings on your devices in Microsoft Intune](/intune/intune-service/configuration/wi-fi-settings-configure)
- [Add Wi-Fi settings for iOS and iPadOS devices in Microsoft Intune](/intune/intune-service/configuration/wi-fi-settings-ios)
- [Assign policies in Intune](/intune/intune-service/configuration/device-profile-assign)
