If Wi-Fi profiles aren't properly configured and assigned, users might connect insecurely or fail to connect to secure networks, or can connect insecurely, exposing corporate data to interception or unauthorized access. By centrally managing corporate Wi-Fi for iOS devices through Microsoft Intune, you ensure that all corporate devices connect securely and consistently to enterprise wireless networks. This approach enforces security standards like WPA/WPA2 Enterprise, simplifies onboarding, and reduces the risk of misconfiguration or unauthorized access. 

Use Intune to configure secure Wi-Fi profiles that enforce authentication and encryption standards.

**Remediation action**

- [Add and use Wi-Fi settings on your devices in Microsoft Intune](/intune/intune-service/configuration/wi-fi-settings-configure)
- [Add Wi-Fi settings for iOS and iPadOS devices in Microsoft Intune](/intune/intune-service/configuration/wi-fi-settings-ios)
- [Assign policies in Intune](/intune/intune-service/configuration/device-profile-assign)
