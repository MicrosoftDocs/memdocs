If compliance policies aren't assigned to Android Enterprise personally owned devices in Intune, threat actors can exploit noncompliant endpoints to gain unauthorized access to corporate resources, bypass security controls, and introduce vulnerabilities. Without enforced compliance, devices can lack critical security configurations like passcode requirements, data storage encryption, and OS version controls. These gaps increase the risk of data leakage and unauthorized access. Inconsistent device compliance weakens the organizationâ€™s security posture and makes it harder to detect and remediate threats before significant damage occurs.

Enforcing compliance policies ensures that personally owned Android devices meet core security requirements and supports Zero Trust by validating device health and reducing exposure to misconfigured or unmanaged endpoints.
