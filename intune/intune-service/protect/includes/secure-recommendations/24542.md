When compliance policies for macOS devices aren't configured and assigned, threat actors can exploit unmanaged or noncompliant macOS devices to gain unauthorized access to corporate resources, bypass security controls, and persist within the environment. Without enforced compliance, macOS devices might lack critical security configurations like encryption, password requirements, or OS version controls. Lack of these configurations increases the risk of data leakage, privilege escalation, and lateral movement. This gap in device compliance management can break the chain of defense, making it difficult to detect and remediate threats or unauthorized access before significant damage occurs.

**Remediation actions**

- [Create and assign Intune compliance policies](/intune/intune-service/protect/create-compliance-policy)
- [Review the maOS compliance settings you can manage with Intune](/intune/intune-service/protect/compliance-policy-create-mac-os)
- [Assign policies in Intune](/intune/intune-service/configuration/device-profile-assign)
