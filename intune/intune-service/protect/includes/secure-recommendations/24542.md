If compliance policies for macOS devices aren't configured and assigned, threat actors can exploit unmanaged or noncompliant endpoints to gain unauthorized access to corporate resources, bypass security controls, and persist within the environment. Without enforced compliance, macOS devices can lack critical security configurations like data storage encryption, password requirements, and OS version controls. These gaps increase the risk of data leakage, privilege escalation, and lateral movement. Inconsistent device compliance weakens the organizationâ€™s security posture and makes it harder to detect and remediate threats before significant damage occurs.

Enforcing compliance policies ensures macOS devices meet core security requirements and supports Zero Trust by validating device health and reducing exposure to misconfigured endpoints.

**Remediation actions**

Create and assign Intune compliance policies to macOS devices to enforce organizational standards for secure access and management:  
- [Create and assign Intune compliance policies](/intune/intune-service/protect/create-compliance-policy#create-the-policy)
- [Review the maOS compliance settings you can manage with Intune](/intune/intune-service/protect/compliance-policy-create-mac-os)
