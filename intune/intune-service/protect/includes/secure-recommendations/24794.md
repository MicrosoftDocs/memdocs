If Terms and Conditions policies aren't configured and assigned in Intune, users can access corporate resources without agreeing to required legal, security, or usage terms. This omission exposes the organization to compliance risks, legal liabilities, and potential misuse of resources.

Enforcing Terms and Conditions ensures users acknowledge and accept company policies before accessing sensitive data or systems, supporting regulatory compliance and responsible resource use.

**Remediation action**

Create and assign Terms and Conditions policies in Intune to require user acceptance before granting access to corporate resources:
