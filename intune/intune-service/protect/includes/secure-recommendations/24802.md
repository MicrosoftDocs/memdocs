If device cleanup rules aren't configured in Intune, stale, or inactive devices might remain in the tenant indefinitely, leading to cluttered device lists and inaccurate reports. 

Device clean-up rules help automate the removal of inactive devices, improving hygiene and reducing administrative overhead.
