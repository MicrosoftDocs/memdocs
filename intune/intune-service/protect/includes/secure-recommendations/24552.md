Without a centrally managed firewall policy, macOS devices may rely on default or user-modified settings, which often fail to meet corporate security standards. This exposes devices to unsolicited inbound connections, enabling threat actors to exploit vulnerabilities, establish outbound command-and-control (C2) traffic for data exfiltration, and move laterally within the networkâ€”significantly escalating the scope and impact of a breach.

Configure and assign macOS firewall policies in Intune to block unauthorized inbound and outbound traffic, ensuring consistent enforcement of corporate security standards across all devices.
