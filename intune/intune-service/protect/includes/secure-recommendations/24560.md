Without enforcing Local Administrator Password Solution (LAPS) policies, threat actors who gain access to endpoints can exploit static or weak local administrator passwords to escalate privileges, move laterally, and establish persistence. The attack chain typically begins with device compromise—via phishing, malware, or physical access—followed by attempts to harvest local admin credentials. Without Cloud LAPS, attackers can reuse compromised credentials across multiple devices, increasing the risk of privilege escalation and domain-wide compromise.

Enforcing Cloud LAPS on all corporate Windows devices ensures unique, regularly rotated local admin passwords, disrupts the kill chain at the credential access and lateral movement stages, and significantly reduces the risk of widespread compromise.

**Remediation action**  
Use Intune to configure and assign Windows LAPS policies. Back up credentials securely to Microsoft Entra ID or Active Directory, and monitor password rotation status to prevent credential reuse and lateral movement.
