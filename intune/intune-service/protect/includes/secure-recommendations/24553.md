When Windows Update policies aren't enforced across all corporate Windows devices, threat actors can exploit unpatched vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access, escalate privileges, and move laterally within the environment. The attack chain typically begins with device compromise via phishing, malware, or exploitation of known vulnerabilities, and is followed by attempts to bypass security controls. Without enforced update policies, attackers can leverage outdated software to persist in the environment, increasing the risk of privilege escalation and domain-wide compromise. Enforcing Windows Update policies ensures timely patching of security flaws to help disrupt the kill chain at the initial access and persistence stages, which significantly reduces the risk of widespread compromise.
