If policies for Microsoft Defender Antivirus aren't properly configured and assigned in Intune, threat actors can exploit unprotected endpoints to execute malware, disable antivirus protections, and persist within the environment. Without enforced antivirus policies, devices operate with outdated definitions, disabled real-time protection, or misconfigured scan schedules. These gaps allow attackers to bypass detection, escalate privileges, and move laterally across the network. The absence of antivirus enforcement undermines device compliance, increases exposure to zero-day threats, and can result in regulatory noncompliance. Attackers leverage these weaknesses to maintain persistence and evade detection, especially in environments lacking centralized policy enforcement.

Enforcing Defender Antivirus policies ensures consistent protection against malware, supports real-time threat detection, and aligns with Zero Trust by maintaining a secure and compliant endpoint posture.

**Remediation action**

Configure and assign Intune policies for Microsoft Defender Antivirus to enforce real-time protection, maintain up-to-date definitions, and reduce exposure to malware:

- [Configure Intune policies to manage Microsoft Defender Antivirus](/intune/intune-service/protect/endpoint-security-antivirus-policy#windows)
- [Assign policies in Intune](/intune/intune-service/configuration/device-profile-assign#assign-a-policy-to-users-or-groups)
