If policies for Microsoft Defender antivirus aren't properly configured and assigned in Intune, threat actors can exploit unprotected endpoints to execute malware, disable antivirus protections, and persist within the environment. Without enforced antivirus policies, devices can operate with outdated definitions, disabled real-time protection, or misconfigured scan schedules. These risks can allow attackers to bypass detection and escalate privileges, which enables lateral movement across the network, credential harvesting, and data exfiltration. The absence of antivirus enforcement undermines device compliance, increases exposure to zero-day threats, and can result in regulatory noncompliance. Attackers can leverage these gaps to maintain persistence and evade detection, especially in environments lacking centralized policy enforcement.
