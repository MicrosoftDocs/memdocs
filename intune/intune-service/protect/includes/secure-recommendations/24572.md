Without configuration and assignment of device enrollment notifications in Intune, threat actors can exploit device onboarding gaps to enroll unauthorized or unmanaged devices, bypassing organizational compliance and visibility. Unauthorized enrollments can lead to threat actors gaining access to corporate resources, which increases risk of data leakage, lateral movement, and persistence within the environment. Also, if notifications aren't assigned, users might not learn of enrollment requirements or security expectations. This lack of awareness can weaken the organizationâ€™s security posture and make it easier for threat actors to exploit device enrollment vulnerabilities. This exposure can result in regulatory noncompliance and operational disruption.
