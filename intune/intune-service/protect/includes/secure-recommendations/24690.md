When macOS update policies arenâ€™t properly configured and assigned, threat actors can exploit unpatched vulnerabilities in macOS devices within the organization. Without enforced update policies, devices might remain on outdated software versions, increasing the attack surface for privilege escalation, remote code execution, or persistence techniques. Threat actors can leverage these weaknesses to gain initial access, escalate privileges, and move laterally within the environment. The absence of policy assignment means that even if a policy exists, it isn't applied to any device group, which leaves your endpoints unprotected and compliance gaps undetected. This can result in widespread compromise, data exfiltration, and operational disruption.
