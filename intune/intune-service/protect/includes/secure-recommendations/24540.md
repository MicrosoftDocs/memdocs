If policies for Windows Firewall aren't configured and assigned, threat actors can exploit unprotected endpoints to gain unauthorized access, move laterally, and escalate privileges within the environment. Without enforced firewall rules, attackers can bypass network segmentation, exfiltrate data, or deploy malware, increasing the risk of widespread compromise.

Configure and assign Windows firewall policies in Intune to block unauthorized inbound and outbound traffic, ensuring consistent enforcement of corporate security standards across all devices.
