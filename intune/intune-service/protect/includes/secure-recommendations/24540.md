When policies for Windows Firewall aren't configured and assigned, threat actors can exploit unprotected endpoints to gain unauthorized access, move laterally, and escalate privileges within the environment. Without enforced firewall rules, attackers can bypass network segmentation, exfiltrate data, or deploy malware, increasing the risk of widespread compromise. Ensure that firewall policies are both created and assigned to device groups to disrupt the attack chain at the initial access and lateral movement stages, which helps reduce the attack surface and improve your organization’s security posture.
