If endpoint analytics isn't enabled, threat actors can exploit gaps in device health, performance, and security posture. Without the visibility Endpoint analytics brings, organizations can fail to detect indicators like anomalous device behavior, delayed patching, or configuration drift. These indicators can result when threat actors establish persistence, escalate privileges, and move laterally across the environment.

An absence of analytics data can impede rapid detection and response, allowing attackers to exploit unmonitored endpoints for command and control, data exfiltration, or further compromise. A lack of insight weakens the chain of defense, making it difficult to identify and remediate issues before they're weaponized.
