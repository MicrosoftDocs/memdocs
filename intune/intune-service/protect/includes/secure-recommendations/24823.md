If the Intune Company Portal branding isn't configured to represent your organization’s details, users can encounter a generic interface and lack direct support information. This reduces user trust, increases support overhead, and can lead to confusion or delays in resolving issues.

Customizing the Company Portal with your organization’s branding and support contact details improves user trust, streamlines support, and reinforces the legitimacy of device management communications.


**Remediation action**

Configure the Intune Company Portal with your organization’s branding and support contact information to enhance user experience and reduce support overhead:
