If the Intune Company Portal branding isn't configured to represent your organizations details, users might encounter a generic interface and lack direct support information, which can reduce trust and increase support overhead.

Customize the Company Portal with your organizationâ€™s branding and support contact details to improve user trust and reduce support overhead.

**Remediation action**

- [Configure the Intune Company Portal](/intune/intune-service/apps/company-portal-app)
