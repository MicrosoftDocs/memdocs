If the Intune Company Portal branding isn't configured to represent your organizations details, users might encounter a generic interface and lack direct support information, which can reduce trust and increase support overhead.

Customizing Company Portal branding and end-user support settings in Intune ensures users have a branded experience and clear support contacts when accessing the portal.

**Remediation action**
