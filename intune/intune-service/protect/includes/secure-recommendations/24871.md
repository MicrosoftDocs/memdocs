If automatic enrollment into Microsoft Defender for Endpoint isn't configured for Android devices in Intune, managed endpoints might remain unprotected against mobile threats. Without Defender onboarding, devices lack advanced threat detection and response capabilities, increasing the risk of malware, phishing, and other mobile-based attacks. Unprotected devices can bypass security policies, access corporate resources, and expose sensitive data to compromise. This gap in mobile threat defense weakens the organization's Zero Trust posture and reduces visibility into endpoint health.

Enabling automatic Defender enrollment ensures Android devices are protected by advanced threat detection and response capabilities. This supports Zero Trust by enforcing mobile threat protection, improving visibility, and reducing exposure to unmanaged or compromised endpoints.

**Remediation action**

Use Intune to configure automatic enrollment into Microsoft Defender for Endpoint for Android devices to enforce mobile threat protection:
