Centrally managing corporate Wi-Fi network settings for fully managed Android Enterprise devices through Microsoft Intune ensures that all corporate devices connect securely and consistently to enterprise wireless networks. This approach enforces security standards like WPA Enterprise, simplifies onboarding, and reduces the risk of misconfiguration or unauthorized access. If Wi-Fi profiles aren't properly configured and assigned, users might be unable to connect to secure networks, or can connect insecurely, exposing corporate data to interception or unauthorized access.

**Remediation action**

- [Add and use Wi-Fi settings on your devices in Microsoft Intune](/intune/intune-service/configuration/wi-fi-settings-configure)
- [Add Wi-Fi settings for Android devices in Microsoft Intune](/intune/intune-service/configuration/wi-fi-settings-android-enterprise)
- [Assign policies in Intune](/intune/intune-service/configuration/device-profile-assign)
