If Wi-Fi profiles aren't properly configured and assigned, Android devices may fail to connect to secure networks or connect insecurely, exposing corporate data to interception or unauthorized access. Centrally managing corporate Wi-Fi for Android devices through Microsoft Intune ensures secure and consistent connectivity to enterprise wireless networks. This approach enforces standards like WPA/WPA2 Enterprise, simplifies onboarding, and reduces the risk of misconfiguration or unauthorized access.

Use Intune to configure secure Wi-Fi profiles that enforce authentication and encryption standards.

**Remediation action**

- [Add and use Wi-Fi settings on your devices in Microsoft Intune](/intune/intune-service/configuration/wi-fi-settings-configure)
- [Add Wi-Fi settings for Android devices in Microsoft Intune](/intune/intune-service/configuration/wi-fi-settings-android-enterprise)
- [Assign policies in Intune](/intune/intune-service/configuration/device-profile-assign)
