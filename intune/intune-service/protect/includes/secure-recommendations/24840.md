If Wi-Fi profiles aren't properly configured and assigned, Android devices can fail to connect to secure networks or connect insecurely, exposing corporate data to interception or unauthorized access. Without centralized management, devices rely on manual configuration, increasing the risk of misconfiguration, weak authentication, and connection to rogue networks.

Centrally managing Wi-Fi profiles for Android devices in Intune ensures secure and consistent connectivity to enterprise networks. This enforces authentication and encryption standards, simplifies onboarding, and supports Zero Trust by reducing exposure to untrusted networks.



Use Intune to configure secure Wi-Fi profiles that enforce authentication and encryption standards.

**Remediation action**

Use Intune to configure and assign secure Wi-Fi profiles for Android devices to enforce authentication and encryption standards:  
- [Deploy Wi-Fi profiles to devices in Microsoft Intune](/intune/intune-service/configuration/wi-fi-settings-configure#create-the-profile)

For more information, see:
