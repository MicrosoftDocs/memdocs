If a macOS Cloud Local Administrator Password Solution (LAPS) policy isn't configured and assigned in Intune, local admin accounts on enrolled macOS devices can remain unmanaged, increasing the risk of unauthorized access, privilege escalation, and lateral movement by threat actors. Without enforced LAPS policies, organizations can't ensure that admin account credentials are rotated, unique, and securely managed, exposing sensitive systems to potential compromise.

Provision macOS devices using ADE and enforce Cloud LAPS to ensure unique, encrypted, and rotated admin credentials. Provisioning devices in this way disrupts the kill chain at the credential access and lateral movement stages, and significantly reduces the risk of widespread compromise.
