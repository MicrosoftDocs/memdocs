If app protection policies for iOS devices aren't configured and assigned, threat actors can exploit unmanaged or insufficiently protected mobile applications to exfiltrate corporate data, escalate privileges, or persist within the environment. Without app protection policies, sensitive data accessed via corporate apps on iOS devices is vulnerable to data leakage through copy and paste, backup, or unencrypted storage. Threat actors might use compromised or noncompliant devices to bypass controls, move laterally, or introduce malicious payloads, which can undermine the organizationâ€™s data protection and compliance posture. This gap in mobile application management can break the chain of defense, making it difficult to detect and remediate data loss or unauthorized access before significant damage occurs.

**Remediation action**

- [Create and assign Intune app protection policies](/intune/intune-service/apps/app-protection-policy)
- [Review the iOS app protection settings you can manage with Intune](/intune/intune-service/apps/app-protection-policy-settings-ios)
