Without app protection policies, corporate data accessed on iOS/iPadOS devices is vulnerable to leakage through unmanaged or personal apps. Users can unintentionally copy sensitive information into unsecured apps, store data outside corporate boundaries, or bypass authentication controls. This risk is especially high on BYOD devices, where personal and work contexts coexist, increasing the likelihood of data exfiltration or unauthorized access.

App protection policies ensure corporate data remains secure within approved apps, even on personal devices. These policies enforce encryption, restrict data sharing, and require authentication, reducing the risk of data leakage and aligning with Zero Trust principles of data protection and conditional access.
 
**Remediation action**

Deploy Intune app protection policies that encrypt corporate data, restrict sharing, and require authentication in approved iOS/iPadOS apps:  
- [Deploy Intune app protection policies](/intune/intune-service/apps/app-protection-policies#create-an-iosipados-or-android-app-protection-policy)
- [Review the iOS app protection settings reference](/intune/intune-service/apps/app-protection-policy-settings-ios)
