# Creating elevation rules with Endpoint Privilege Management

[!INCLUDE [intune-add-on-note](../includes/intune-add-on-note.md)]

[!INCLUDE [intune-epm-overview](includes/intune-epm-overview.md)]

Elevation rules policies allow Endpoint Privilege Management (EPM) to identify specific files and scripts and perform the associated elevation action. For elevation rules to take effect, devices must have an *elevation settings policy* targeted that enables EPM. For more information, see [EPM elevation settings](epm-elevation-settings.md).

In addition to the information in this article, remain aware of important [security recommendations](../protect/epm-plan.md#security-recommendations) when managing elevation rules.

## About elevation rules policy

An *elevation rules policy* is used to manage the identification of specific files, and how elevation requests for those files are handled. Each *elevation rule policy* includes one or more *elevation rules*. It's with elevation rules that you configure details about the file being managed and requirements for it to be elevated.

The following types of files are supported:

- Executable files with the `.exe` or `.msi` extension.
- PowerShell scripts with the `.ps1` extension.

Each elevation rule instructs EPM on how to:

- **Identify the file using**:

  - *File name (including extension).* The rule also supports optional conditions like a minimum build version, product name, or internal name. Optional conditions are used to further validate the file when elevation is attempted. The file name (excluding extensions) can include use of [variables](#use-variables-in-elevation-rules) for single characters through use of a question mark `?` or strings through use of an asterisk `*`.
  - *Certificate.* Certificates can be added directly to a rule, or by using a reusable settings group. Certificates must be trusted and valid. We recommend the use of reusable settings groups as they can be more efficient and simplify a future change to the certificate. For more information, see [Reusable settings groups](epm-elevation-rules.md#reusable-settings-groups).

- **Validate the file**:

  - *File hash.* A file hash is required for automatic rules. For user confirmed rules, you can choose to either use a certificate or a file hash, in which case the file hash becomes optional.
  - *Certificate.* File properties can be validated alongside the publisher certificate used to sign the file. Certificates are validated using Windows APIs which check attributes such as trust, certificate expiry and revocation status.
  - *File properties.* Any other properties specified in the rules must match.

- **Configure the files elevation type.** Elevation type identifies what happens when an elevation request is made for the file. By default, this option is set to *User confirmed*.
  - **Deny**: Deny rules prevent the identified file from being run in an elevated context.
  - **Support approved**: An administrator must approve the [support-required elevation request](../protect/epm-support-approved.md) before the application is allowed to run with elevated privileges.
  - **User confirmed**: A user confirmed elevation always requires the user to select on a confirmation prompt to run the file. The confirmation can only be configured to require a user authentication, a business justification (visible in reporting), or both.
  - **Automatic**: An automatic elevation happens invisibly to the user. There's no prompt, and no indication that the file is running in an elevated context.

- **Manage the behavior of child processes.** You can set the elevation behavior that applies to any child processes that the elevated process creates.

  - **Require rule to elevate** - Configure a child processes to require its own rule before that child process can run in an elevated context.
  - **Deny all** - All child processes launch without elevated context.
  - **Allow child processes to run elevated** - Configure a child process to always run elevated.

> [!NOTE]
> For more information about creating *strong rules*, see [Defining rules for use with Endpoint Privilege Management](#defining-rules-for-use-with-endpoint-privilege-management).
>
> You can also use the `Get-FileAttributes` PowerShell cmdlet from the [EpmTools PowerShell module](epm-plan.md#epmtools-powershell-module). This cmdlet can retrieve file attributes for an .exe file and extract its Publisher and CA certificates to a set location that you can use to populate Elevation Rule Properties for a particular application.

> [!CAUTION]
>
> We recommend automatic elevation be used sparingly, and only for trusted files that are business critical. End users automatically elevate these applications at *every* launch of that application.

## Defining rules for use with Endpoint Privilege Management

Endpoint Privilege Management rules consist of two fundamental elements: a *detection* and an *elevation action*.

**Detections** are defined as the set of attributes used to identify an application or binary. These attributes include file name, file version, and signature properties.

**Elevation actions** are the resulting elevation that occurs after an application or binary is detected.

It's important when defining *detections* that they're defined to be as *descriptive* as possible. To be descriptive, use strong attributes, or multiple attributes to increase the strength of the detection. The goal when defining detections should be to eliminate the ability for multiple files to fall into the same rule, unless that is explicitly the intent.

### File hash rules

File hash rules are the strongest rules that can be created with Endpoint Privilege Management. These rules are *highly recommended* to ensure the file you intend to elevate is the file that is elevated.

File hash can be gathered from the direct binary using the [Get-Filehash PowerShell method](/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.utility/get-filehash) or directly from the [reports for Endpoint Privilege Management](../protect/epm-reports.md).

### Certificate rules

Certificate rules are a strong type of attribute and should be paired with other attributes. Pairing a certificate with attributes like product name, internal name, and description, drastically improves the security of the rule. These attributes are protected by a files signature, and often indicate specifics about the signed file.

> [!CAUTION]
> Using only a certificate and a file name to identify files isn't recommended. Any *standard user* with access to a directory where the file resides can change the file name. This issue might not be a concern for files that reside in a write-protected directory.

### Rules containing file name

File name is an attribute that can be utilized to detect an application that needs to be elevated. However, file names are easily changed and don't make up part of the hash or attributes signed by the publisher certificate.

This means that file names are *highly susceptible* to change. Files you don't intentionally target signed by a certificate that you trust can be renamed to be *detected* and *elevated*.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Always ensure that rules including a file name include other attributes that provide a strong assertion to the file's identity. Attributes like file hash or properties that are included in the files signature (for example, product name) are good indicators that the file you intend is likely the one being elevated.

### Rules based on attributes gathered by PowerShell

To help you build more accurate file detection rules, you can use the **Get-FileAttributes** PowerShell cmdlet. Available from the EpmTools PowerShell module, *Get-FileAttributes* can retrieve file attributes and the certificate chain material for a file and you can use the output to populate elevation rule properties for a particular application.

Example module import steps and output from Get-FileAttributes run against msinfo32.exe on Windows 11 version 10.0.22621.2506:

```powershell
PS C:\Windows\system32> Import-Module 'C:\Program Files\Microsoft EPM Agent\EpmTools\EpmCmdlets.dll'
PS C:\Windows\system32> Get-FileAttributes -FilePath C:\Windows\System32\msinfo32.exe -CertOutputPath C:\CertsForMsInfo\

FileName      : msinfo32.exe
FilePath      : C:\Windows\System32
FileHash      : 18C8442887C36F7DB61E77013AAA5A1A6CDAF73D4648B2210F2D51D8B405191D
HashAlgorithm : Sha256
ProductName   : Microsoft&reg; Windows&reg; Operating System
InternalName  : msinfo.dll
Version       : 10.0.22621.2506
Description   : System Information
CompanyName   : Microsoft Corporation

```

> [!NOTE]
> The certificate chain for msinfo32.exe is output to the C:\CertsForMsInfo directory listed in the command example.

For more information, see [EpmTools PowerShell module](../protect/epm-plan.md#epmtools-powershell-module).

### Controlling child process behavior

Child process behavior allows you to control the context when a process elevated with EPM creates a child process. This behavior allows you to control processes that would be automatically delegated the context of its parent process.

Windows automatically delegates the context of a parent to a child, so take special care in controlling the behavior for your allowed applications. Ensure you evaluate what is needed when you create elevation rules, and implement the principle of least privilege.

> [!NOTE]
>
> Changing the child process behavior might have compatibility issues with certain applications that expect the default Windows behavior. Make sure you thoroughly test applications when manipulating the child process behavior.

## Deploying rules created with Endpoint Privilege Management

Endpoint Privilege Management rules are deployed like any other policy in Microsoft Intune. This means that rules can be deployed to users or devices, and rules are merged on the client side and selected at run time. Any conflicts are resolved based on the [policy conflict behavior](epm-plan.md#policy-conflict-handling-for-endpoint-privilege-management).

Rules deployed to a device apply to *every user* that uses that device. Rules that are deployed to a *user* apply only to that user on each device that they utilize. When an elevation action occurs, rules deployed to the user are given precedence to rules deployed to a device. This behavior allows you to deploy a set of rules to all users of a device, and a more permissive set of rules to a specific user (such as a support admin). This would allow the support administrator to elevate a broader set of applications when they sign-in to the device.

*Default Elevation behavior* is used only when no rule match can be found. The default elevation behavior only applies when an elevation is triggered with the *Run with elevated access* right-click menu.

## Create elevation rules policy

Deploy an *Elevation rules policy* to users or devices to deploy one or more rules for files that are managed for elevation by Endpoint Privilege Management. Each rule you add to this policy:

- Identifies a file by file name and file extension for which you want to manage elevation requests.
- Can include a certificate to help validate the file's integrity. You can also add a reusable group that contains a certificate that you then use with one or more rules or policies.
- Can include one or more manually added [file arguments or command line switches](#use-file-arguments-for-elevation-rules). When file arguments are added to a rule, EPM only allows file elevation of requests that include one of the defined command lines. If a defined command line isn't part of the file elevation request, EPM denies that request.
- Specifies if the elevation type of the file is automatic (silently), or if it requires user confirmation. With user confirmation, you can require validation with a credential prompt, or business justification, or both.

> [!NOTE]
> In addition to this policy, a device must also be assigned a Windows elevation settings policy that enables Endpoint Privilege Management.

Use either of the following methods to create new elevation rules, which are added to elevation rules policy:

- [**Automatically configure elevation rules**](#automatically-configure-elevation-rules-for-windows-elevation-rules-policy) – Use this method to save time when creating an elevation rule by adding files details from reporting. Rules can be created using the *[Elevation report](../protect/epm-reports.md#elevation-report)* or from a *[support approved](../protect/epm-support-approved.md)* elevation requests record.

  With this method, you:  

  - Select the file for which you want to create an elevation rule from the Elevation report or *support approved* elevation request.  
  - Choose to add the new elevation rule to an existing elevation rules policy or create a new elevation rules policy that includes the new rule.
    - When added to an existing policy, the new rule is immediately available to that policies list of assigned groups.
    - When a new policy is created, you must edit that policy to assign groups before it becomes available for use.

- [**Manually configure elevation rules**](#manually-configure-elevation-rules-for-windows-elevation-rules-policy) – This method requires you to identify the file details you want to use for detection and to manually enter them as part of the rule creation workflow. For information about detection criteria, see [Defining rules for use with Endpoint Privilege Management](#defining-rules-for-use-with-endpoint-privilege-management).

  With this method, you:

  - Manually determine the file details to use and then add them to the elevation rule for file identification.
  - Configure all aspects of the policy during policy creation, including assigning the policy to groups for use.
  - Can add one or more file arguments that must be part of the elevation request before EPM allows file elevation.

> [!TIP]  
> For both automatically configured and manually configured elevation rules, we [recommend use of a *File path*](../protect/epm-plan.md#require-file-path-restrictions-in-all-rule-types) that points to a location that standard users can't modify.

### Automatically configure elevation rules for Windows elevation rules policy

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431) and go to **Endpoint security** > **Endpoint Privilege Management**. To select a file to use for an elevation rule, choose one of the following starting paths:

   **Start from a Report:**

   1. Select the **Reports** tab and then the **Elevation report** tile. Locate the file you want to create a rule for in the *File* column.
   2. Select the linked name of the file to open that files **Elevation detail** pane.

   **Start from a support approved elevation request:**

   1. Select the **Elevation request** tab.
   2. From the *File* column, select the file that you want to use for the elevation rule, which opens that files **Elevation detail** pane.

      The status of the elevation request doesn't matter. You can use a pending request or one that was previously approved or denied.

2. On the **Elevation detail** pane, review the file details. This information is used by the elevation rule to identify the correct file. When ready, select **Create a rule with these file details**.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/epm-policies/elevation-detail-pane.png" alt-text="Image from the admin center UI of a file selected from the Elevation report." lightbox="./media/epm-policies/elevation-detail-pane.png":::

3. Select a policy option for the new elevation rule you're creating:

   **Create a new policy:**  
   This option creates a new policy that includes an elevation rule for the file you selected.

   1. For the rule, configure the **Type** and **Child process behavior**, and then select **OK** to create the policy.
   2. When prompted, provide a **Policy name** for the new policy and confirm to create it.
   3. After the policy is created, you can edit the policy to assign it and make any other changes.

   **Add to an existing policy:**  
   With this option, use the drop-down list and select an existing elevation policy to which the new elevation rule is added.

   1. For the rule, configure the elevation **Type** and **Child process behavior**, and then select **OK**. The policy is updated with the new rule.
   2. After the rule is added to the policy, you can edit the policy to gain access to the rule and then modify it to make additional configurations if needed.

   **Require the same file path as this elevation:**  
   When you select this checkbox, the File Path field in the rule is set to the file path as seen in the report. If the checkbox isn't selected, the path remains empty.

   > [!TIP]  
   > While optional, we [recommend use of a *File path*](../protect/epm-plan.md#require-file-path-restrictions-in-all-rule-types) that points to a location that standard users can't modify.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/epm-policies/create-a-rule.png" alt-text="Image from the admin center UI of the 'create a rule' pane." lightbox="./media/epm-policies/create-a-rule.png":::

### Manually configure elevation rules for Windows elevation rules policy

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431) and go to **Endpoint security** > **Endpoint Privilege Management** > select the **Policies** tab > and then select **Create Policy**.
   Set the *Platform* to **Windows**, *Profile* to **Windows elevation rules policy**, and then select **Create**.

2. On **Basics**, enter the following properties:

   - **Name**: Enter a descriptive name for the profile. Name profiles so you can easily identify them later.
   - **Description**: Enter a description for the profile. This setting is optional but recommended.

3. On **Configuration settings**, add a rule for each file that this policy manages. When you create a new policy, the policy starts includes a blank rule with an elevation type of *User confirmed* and no rule name. Start by configuring this rule, and later you can select **Add** to add more rules to this policy. Each new rule you add has an elevation type of User confirmed, which can be changed when you configure the rule.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/epm-policies/new-elevation-rules-policy.png" alt-text="Image from the admin center UI of a new elevation rules policy." lightbox="./media/epm-policies/new-elevation-rules-policy.png":::

   To configure a rule, select **Edit instance** to open its Rule properties page, and then configure the following:

   :::image type="content" source="./media/epm-policies/elevation-rules.png" alt-text="Image of the elevation rules properties." lightbox="./media/epm-policies/elevation-rules.png":::

   - **Rule name**: Specify a descriptive name for the rule. Name your rules so you can easily identify them later.
   - **Description** (Optional): Enter a description for the profile.

   *Elevation conditions* are conditions that define how a file runs, and user validations that must be met before the file this rule applies to can be run.

   - **Elevation type**: By default, this option is set to *User confirmed*, which is the elevation type most commonly used as it allows elevation, but requires user acknowledgment.

     - **Deny**: A *deny* rule prevents the identified file from being run in an elevated context. The following behaviors apply:
       - *Deny* rules support the same configuration options as other elevation types with the exception of the child process options. Child process options aren't used from this rule even if configured.
       - When a user attempts to elevate a file that matches a deny rule, the elevation fails. EPM displays a message that indicates the app can't be run as administrator. Should that user also be assigned a rule that allows elevation of that same file, the [deny rule takes precedence](epm-plan.md#policy-conflict-handling-for-endpoint-privilege-management).
       - Denied elevations appear in the elevation report as denied, similar to a rejected *support approved* request.
       - EPM doesn't currently support automatic configuration of a deny rule from the evaluation report.

     - **Support approved**: This elevation type requires an administrator to approve an elevation request. For more information, see [Support approved elevation requests](../protect/epm-support-approved.md).

       > [!Important]
       >
       > Use of support approved elevation for files requires that Admins with additional permissions review and approve each file elevation request before that file on the device with administrator permissions. For information about using the support approved elevation type, see [Support approved file elevations for Endpoint Privilege Management](../protect/epm-support-approved.md).

     - **User confirmed**: Most commonly used for files with rules that require elevation because it allows elevation, but requires user acknowledgment. When a file is run, the user receives a simple prompt to confirm their intent to run the file. The rule can also include other prompts that are available from the *Validation* drop down:

       - *Business justification*: Require the user to enter a justification for running the file. There's no required format for the entry. The user input is saved and can be reviewed through logs if the *Reporting scope* includes collection of endpoint elevations.
       - *Windows authentication*: This option requires the user to authenticate using their organization credentials.

     - **Automatic**: This elevation type automatically runs the file with elevated permissions. Automatic elevation is transparent to the user, without prompting for confirmation or requiring justification or authentication by the user.

       > [!CAUTION]
       >
       > Only use automatic elevation by exception and for files you trust. These files will automatically elevate without user interaction. Rules that aren't well defined could allow unapproved applications to elevate. For more information on creating strong rules, see the [guidance for creating rules](#defining-rules-for-use-with-endpoint-privilege-management).

   - **Child process behavior**: By default, this option is set to *Require rule to elevate*, which requires the child process to match the same rule as process that creates it. Other options include:
     - *Allow all child processes to run elevated*: This option should be used with caution as it allows applications to create child processes unconditionally.
     - *Deny all*: This configuration prevents any child process from being created.

   *File information* is where you specify the details that identify a file that this rule applies to.

   - **File name**: Specify the file name and its extension. For example: `myapplication.exe`. You can also use a [variable](#use-variables-in-elevation-rules) in the file name.
   - **File path** (Optional): Specify the location of the file. If the file can be run from any location or is unknown, you can leave this blank. You can also use a variable.

     > [!TIP]  
     > While optional, we [recommend use of a *File path*](epm-plan.md#require-file-path-restrictions-in-all-rule-types) that points to a location that standard users can't modify.

   - **Signature source**: Choose one of the following options:

     - **Use a certificate file in reusable settings** (Default): This option uses a certificate file that was previously added to a reusable settings group for Endpoint Privilege Management. You must [create a reusable settings group](#reusable-settings-groups) before you can use this option.

       To identify the *Certificate*, select *Add or remove a certificate*, and then select the reusable group that contains the correct certificate. Then, specify the *Certificate type* of *Publisher* or *Certificate authority*.

     - **Upload a certificate file**: Add a certificate file directly to the elevation rule. For *File upload*, specify a **.cer** file that can validate the integrity of the file that this rule applies to. Then, specify the *Certificate type* of *Publisher* or *Certificate authority*.

     - **Not configured**: Use this option when you don't want to use a certificate to validate the integrity of the file. When no certificate is used, you must provide a *file hash*.

   - **File hash**: The file hash is required when Signature source is set to *Not configured*, and optional when set to use a certificate.
   - **Minimum version**: (Optional) Use **x.x.x.x** format to specify a minimum version of the file that is supported by this rule.
   - **File description**: (Optional) Provide a description of the file.
   - **Product name**: (Optional) Specify the name of the product that the file is from.
   - **Internal name**: (Optional) Specify the internal name of the file.

   Select **Save** to save the rule configuration. You can then **Add** more rules. After adding all the rules this policy requires, select **Next** to continue.

4. On the **Scope tags** page, select any desired scope tags to apply, then select **Next**.

5. For **Assignments**, select the groups that receive the policy. For more information on assigning profiles, see [Assign user and device profiles](../configuration/device-profile-assign.md). Select **Next**.

6. In **Review + create**, review your settings, and then select **Create**. When you select *Create*, your changes are saved, and the profile is assigned. The policy is also shown in the policy list.

### Use variables in elevation rules

When you manually configure file elevation rules, you can use wildcard characters for the following configurations that are available on the *Rule properties* page of an elevation rule policy:

- **File name**: Wildcards are supported as part of a file name when configuring the *File name* field.
- **Folder path**: Wildcards are supported as part of a folder path when configuring the *Folder path* field.

> [!NOTE]
> Wildcards aren't supported in *automatic* elevation rules.  

Use of wildcards provides flexibility in your rules to support trusted files that have names that might change frequently with subsequent revisions, or for which the file path might also change.

The following wildcard characters are supported:
  
- Question mark `?` - Question marks  replace individual characters in a file name.
- Asterisk `*` - Asterisk replace a string of characters in a file name.

The following are examples of supported wildcard use:

- *File name* for a Visual Studio setup file called `VSCodeSetup-arm64-1.99.2.exe`:  
  - `VSCodeSetup*.exe`
  - `VSCodeSetup-arm64-*.exe`
  - `VSCodeSetup-?????-1.??.?.exe`

- *File path* for the same file, typically found in `C:\Users\<username>\Downloads\`:
  - `C:\Users\*\Downloads\`

> [!TIP]
> When using variables in a file name, avoid use of rule properties that might conflict. For example a *File hash* would match only a file and so a file name wildcard might be redundant.

### Use file arguments for elevation rules

[File elevation rule's](#create-elevation-rules-policy) can also be limited to allow elevation with specific arguments.

For example, [**dsregcmd**](/entra/identity/devices/troubleshoot-device-dsregcmd) can be useful for investigating the state of a device in Microsoft Entra ID, but requires elevation. To help support this files use for investigation, you can configure the rule with a list of arguments for *dsregcmd* that includes the switches for **/status**, **/listaccounts**, and more. However, to prevent a destructive action like unregistering a device you exclude arguments like [**/leave**](/troubleshoot/entra/entra-id/dir-dmns-obj/pending-devices#the-state-of-a-registered-device-is-changed-to-pending). With this configuration, the rule will only allow elevation if the arguments */status*, or */listaccounts* are used. *dsregcmd* with the */leave* switch, which removes the device from Microsoft Entra ID, would be denied.

To add one or more arguments to an elevation rule, set **Restrict arguments** to **Allow list**. Select Add and configure the allowed command line options. By adding multiple arguments, you provide multiple command lines that are supported by elevation requests.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Considerations for file arguments:
>
> - EPM uses file argument lists as allow lists. When configured, EPM will allow elevation when no arguments are used, or only the specified arguments are used. Elevation is blocked if any arguments are used which aren't found in the specified arguments.
> - File arguments are case sensitive; users must match the case exactly as defined in the rules.
> - Don't define secrets as a file argument.

## Reusable settings groups

Endpoint Privilege Management uses reusable settings groups to manage the certificates that validate the files you manage with Endpoint Privilege Management elevation rules. Like all reusable settings groups for Intune, changes to a reusable group are automatically passed to the policies that reference the group. If you must update the certificate you use for file validation, you only need to update it in the reusable settings group a single time. Intune applies the updated certificate to all your elevation rules that use that group.

To create the reusable settings group for Endpoint Privilege Management:

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431) and go to **Endpoint security** > **Endpoint Privilege Management** > select the **Reusable settings (preview)** tab > and then select **Add**.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/epm-policies/add-reusable-settings.png" alt-text="Screen capture of the UI to add a reusable settings group." lightbox="./media/epm-policies/add-reusable-settings.png":::

2. On **Basics**, enter the following properties:
   - **Name**: Enter a descriptive name for the reusable group. Name groups so you can easily identify each later.
   - **Description**: Enter a description for the profile. This setting is optional but recommended.

3. In **Configuration settings**, select the folder icon for *Certificate file*, and browse to a **.CER** file to add it to this reusable group. The *Base 64 value* field fills in based on the certificate selected.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/epm-policies/add-a-certificate.png" alt-text="Screen capture of the UI for browsing to a certificate." lightbox="./media/epm-policies/add-a-certificate.png":::

4. In **Review + create**, review your settings, and then select **Add**. When you select *Add*, your configuration is saved, and group is then shown in the reusable settings group list for Endpoint Privilege Management.
