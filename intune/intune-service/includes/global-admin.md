<!-- This include file is used in articles that mention global admin. -->

The Global Administrator built-in role is a [privileged Microsoft Entra role](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/privileged-roles-permissions), and has more permissions than needed for Intune. To reduce risk, don't use the Global Administrator role to manage Intune.

Assign the least-privileged role that can complete the task. For more information on the built-in roles and what they can do, see [Role-based access control (RBAC) with Intune](../fundamentals/role-based-access-control.md) and [Built-in role permissions for Intune](../fundamentals/role-based-access-control-reference.md).
