On October 14, 2025, [Windows 10 reached end of support](/lifecycle/announcements/windows-10-end-of-support) and won't receive quality and feature updates. Windows 10 is an "allowed" version in Intune. Devices running this version can still enroll in Intune and use eligible features, but functionality won't be guaranteed and can vary.
