<!-- This include file is used in the Apple software updates docs that mention MDM. -->

Apple deprecated MDM-based software update workloads. Microsoft recommends you use [DDM to install updates](../protect/updates/apple.md) instead. For more information on these changes, see [support tip for moving to declarative device management for Apple software updates](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/intunecustomersuccess/support-tip-move-to-declarative-device-management-for-apple-software-updates/4432177).
