> [!IMPORTANT]
> Android device administrator (DA) management is deprecated and no longer available for devices with access to Google Mobile Services (GMS). If you currently use DA management, we recommend switching to another Android management option. Support and help documentation remain available for some Android 15 and earlier devices without GMS. For more information, see [Ending support for Android device administrator on GMS devices](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/intune-customer-success/microsoft-intune-ending-support-for-android-device-administrator/ba-p/3915443).
