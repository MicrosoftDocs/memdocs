Before deploying the framework, Microsoft recommends using a ring methodology for testing validation. Defining deployment rings is generally a one-time event (or at least infrequent). However, IT should revisit these groups to ensure that the sequencing is still correct.

## Deployment ring approach

Microsoft recommends the following deployment ring approach for the framework:

| Deployment ring  | Tenant  | Assessment teams  | Output  | Timeline  |
|--------------------|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Quality Assurance  | Pre-production tenant  | Mobile capability owners, Security, Risk Assessment, Privacy, UX  | Functional scenario validation, draft documentation  | 0-30 days  |
| Preview  | Production tenant  | Mobile capability owners, UX  | End-user scenario validation, user facing documentation  | 7-14 days, post Quality Assurance  |
| Production  | Production tenant  | Mobile capability owners, IT help desk  | N/A  | 7 days to several weeks, post Preview  |

All policy setting changes should be first applied in a pre-production environment to understand the policy setting implications. After testing is complete, move the changes into production and apply them to a subset of production users, the IT department, and other applicable groups. Finally, complete the rollout to the rest of the mobile user community. Roll out to production may take longer depending on the changes' scale of impact. If there's no user impact, the change should roll out quickly. If there's user impact, rollout may need to go slower because of the need to communicate changes to the user population.
