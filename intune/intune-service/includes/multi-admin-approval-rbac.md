Multi Admin Approval now supports role-based access control. When this setting is on, a second administrator must approve changes to roles. These changes can include updates to role permissions, admin groups, or member group assignments. The change takes effect only after the approval. This dual authorization process helps protect your organization from unauthorized or accidental role-based access control changes. For more information, see [Use Multi Admin Approval in Intune](../fundamentals/multi-admin-approval.md).
