<!-- This include file is used in the Android, Apple, and Windows reference device configuration template settings lists in /configuration. -->

Intune might support more settings than the settings listed in this article. Not all settings are documented, and won't be documented. To see the settings you can configure, create a device configuration policy, and select **Settings catalog**. For more information, go to [settings catalog](../configuration/settings-catalog.md).
