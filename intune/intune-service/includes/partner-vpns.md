Some Microsoft 365 services, such as Outlook, may not perform well using third party or partner VPNs. If you're using a third party or partner VPN, and experience a latency or performance issue, then remove the VPN.

If removing the VPN resolves the behavior, then you can:

- Work with the third party or partner VPN for possible resolutions. Microsoft doesn't provide technical support for third party or partner VPNs.
- Don't use a VPN with Outlook traffic.
- If you need to use a VPN, then use a split-tunnel VPN. And, allow the Outlook traffic to bypass the VPN.
