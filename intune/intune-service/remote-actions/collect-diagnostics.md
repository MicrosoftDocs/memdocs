# Collect diagnostics with Intune

Collecting diagnostics in Microsoft Intune is a powerful remote action that enables IT administrators to gather troubleshooting data from managed devices without interrupting users. This feature is essential for identifying and resolving issues related to device compliance, app performance, or enrollment failures—especially in large or distributed environments where hands-on access to devices is limited. For example, if a Windows device fails during Autopilot provisioning, Intune can automatically collect logs from the device and upload them for review, helping admins pinpoint the root cause quickly. This feature can also be used in bulk across up to 25 devices at once, streamlining diagnostics at scale.

The **Collect diagnostics** remote action lets you collect and download managed device diagnostics without interrupting the user. Only nonuser locations and file types are accessed.

## Requirements

### :::image type="icon" source="../media/icons/headers/devices.svg" border="false"::: Platform requirements

> This remote action is supported on the following platforms:
>
> - Windows 10, Windows 11
>   - Intune or co-managed devices
>   - Microsoft HoloLens 2 2004 and later
>   - Corporate-owned devices

### :::image type="icon" source="../media/icons/headers/rbac.svg" border="false"::: Role and permission requirements

> [!div class="checklist"]
> To execute this remote action, you must use an account that has at least one of the following roles:
>
> - [Help Desk Operator][INT-R1]
> - [School Administrator][INT-R2]
> - [Custom role][INT-RC] with the permissions:
>   - Remote tasks/Collect diagnostics

### Connectivity requirements

For diagnostics to be able to upload successfully from the client, make sure that the URL for your region isn't blocked on the network:

- Europe: `lgmsapeweu.blob.core.windows.net`
- Americas: `lgmsapewus2.blob.core.windows.net`
- East Asia: `lgmsapesea.blob.core.windows.net`
- Australia: `lgmsapeaus.blob.core.windows.net`
- India: `lgmsapeind.blob.core.windows.net`

Devices must be online and able to communicate with the service during diagnostics.


> [!NOTE]
>  Intune App Protection logs are available to download from the diagnostics tab in the **Troubleshooting** pane. However, M365 remote application diagnostics are only available to their specific support engineers.
>
> Devices don't have to be managed by MDM (Mobile device management) to have Intune app protection or M365 app diagnostics collected, only managed by an Intune app protection policy.
>
> The data is stored in Microsoft support systems and isn't subject to Intune data management policies or protections. Some applications might collect and store data using systems other than Intune.

## How to collect diagnostics

::: zone pivot="android,ios"

The Microsoft 365 remote application diagnostics enables admins to request Intune app protection diagnostics and Microsoft 365 application diagnostics (where applicable).

Admins can find this report in the [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431) by selecting **Troubleshooting + support** > **Troubleshoot** > *select a user* > **Summary** > *App protection**. This feature is exclusive to applications that are under Intune app protection management. If supported, the application specific logs are gathered and stored within dedicated storage solutions for each application.

Applications with support for M365 application diagnostics:

The **Collect diagnostics** remote action can also be configured to automatically collect and upload Windows devices logs upon a Windows Autopilot failure on a device. When a Windows Autopilot failure occurs, logs are processed on the failed device and then automatically captured and uploaded to Intune. A device can automatically capture one set of logs per day.

The diagnostic collection is stored for 28 days and then deleted. Each device can have up to 10 collections stored at one time.

*Collect diagnostics* is also available as a [Bulk device action](../remote-actions/bulk-device-actions.md) that collects diagnostic logs from up to 25 Windows devices at a time.

> [!NOTE]
> Microsoft personnel might access device diagnostics to help troubleshooting and resolving incidents.

To use the *Collect diagnostics* action:

1. In the [Microsoft Intune admin center][INT-AC], select **Devices** > [**All devices**](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2333814)
1. From the devices list, select a device, and then select **…** >  **Collect diagnostics**
1. To confirm, select **Yes**. A pending notification appears on the device's **Overview** page.

### Data collected

<!--1895390-->
While there's no intent to collect personal data, diagnostics might include user identifiable information such as user or device name.

If you install [KB5011543](https://support.microsoft.com/topic/march-22-2022-kb5011543-os-builds-19042-1620-19043-1620-and-19044-1620-preview-4fe2d1c0-720f-47fe-9523-75339bc107a1) on Windows 10 or [KB5011563](https://support.microsoft.com/topic/march-28-2022-kb5011563-os-build-22000-593-preview-40df54c9-b5a9-42e5-ae1c-9a33ff91ca91) on Windows 11, the format of the zip file is simpler including:

- A flattened structure where the logs collected are named to match the data collected
- When multiple files are collected, a folder is created.

This following list is the same order as the diagnostic zip. Each collection contains the following data:

### Known issues with device diagnostics

Currently there are the two main issues that could cause device diagnostics to fail:

1. A time-out could occur on devices without patches [KB4601315](https://support.microsoft.com/topic/february-9-2021-kb4601315-os-build-18363-1377-bdd71d2f-6729-e22a-3150-64324e4ab954) or [KB4601319](https://support.microsoft.com/topic/february-9-2021-kb4601319-os-builds-19041-804-and-19042-804-87fc8417-4a81-0ebb-5baa-40cfab2fbfde). These patches contain a fix to the DiagnosticLog CSP that prevents time out during upload. After the update installs, make sure to reboot your device.
1. The device wasn't able to receive the device action within a 24-hour window. If the device is offline or turned off, it could cause a failure.
