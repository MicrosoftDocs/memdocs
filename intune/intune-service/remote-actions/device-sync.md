# Remote device action: sync

The *sync* device action forces a device to check in with Intune. When a device checks in, it receives any pending actions or policies assigned to it. This action is useful for validating and troubleshooting policy deployment without waiting for the next scheduled check-in.

For more information about the standard Intune policy check-in frequencies, see [Refresh cycle times](../configuration/device-profile-troubleshoot.md#policy-refresh-intervals).
