# Sync devices to get the latest policies and actions with Intune

The **Sync** device action forces the selected device to immediately check in with Intune. When a device checks in, it immediately receives any pending actions or policies assigned to it. This feature can help you immediately validate and troubleshoot policies you're assigned to, without waiting for the next scheduled check-in.

## Supported platforms

- Windows
- iOS
- macOS
- Android (Device administrator and personally owned work profile only)


 [!INCLUDE [android_device_administrator_support](../includes/android-device-administrator-support.md)]

## Sync a device

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431).
2. Select **Devices** > **All devices**.
3. In the list of devices you manage, select a device to open its *Overview* pane, and then select **Sync**.
4. To confirm, select **Yes**.

You can find standard Intune policy check-in frequencies in the [Refresh cycle times](../configuration/device-profile-troubleshoot.md#policy-refresh-intervals).

## Retryable error codes

When an administrator runs the **Sync** device action, iOS/iPadOS and Android apps that failed and raised a retryable error code are still available to the device. However, apps that raised a nonretryable error code must wait seven days before they're available to the device.
