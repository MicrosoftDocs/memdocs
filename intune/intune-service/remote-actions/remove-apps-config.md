# Remove apps and configuration using Intune

Use the **Remove apps and configuration** remote action in Intune to uninstall apps and remove configuration profiles from a device. This action is useful for troubleshooting or temporarily removing settings that might be causing issues.

You can manually restore the removed items using the **Restore** action. If no restore is initiated, Intune automatically reapplies the apps and configurations within 8-24 hours to ensure the device remains aligned with assignment intent.
