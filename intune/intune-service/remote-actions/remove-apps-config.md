# Remove apps and configuration from devices

**Remove apps and configuration** is a remote action used to uninstall applications and remove configurations from a device. With this action, Intune can temporarily remove apps and configurations from a single device. When ready, you can initiate a **Restore** action to return the removed item to the device. Removed items are automatically restored to devices in 8-24 hours in cases where an admin does not initiate a **Restore** action to ensure that devices remain consistent with assignment intents.

This action aims to resolve the issues that customers face outside of Intune and swiftly bring back end-user efficiency.

If connectivity is lost, end users may need to take actions on devices to restore connectivity; connect the device to a guest or alternate Wi-Fi or Cellular network.
