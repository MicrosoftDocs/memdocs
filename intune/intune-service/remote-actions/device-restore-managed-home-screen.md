## How to restore the managed home screen from the Intune admin center

1. In the [Microsoft Intune admin center][INT-AC], select **Devices** > [**All devices**][INT-ALLD].
1. From the devices list, select a device.
1. At the top of the device overview pane, find the row of remote action icons. Select **Restore managed home screen**.

## User experience

Once the managed home screen is restored, the device will enforce the managed home screen policies again, and the user will have access to the managed home screen and apps.
