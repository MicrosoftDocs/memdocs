# Remote device action: Lost Mode

The *Lost Mode* device action in Microsoft Intune allows IT administrators to remotely lock and track lost or stolen devices. When activated, Lost Mode displays a custom message and contact phone number on the device's lock screenâ€”helping facilitate recovery while protecting corporate data.

::: zone pivot="ios"
Once enabled, the device is locked and can't be accessed until Lost Mode is disabled by an administrator. While in Lost Mode, the device's location can also be tracked with the **[Locate device](device-locate.md)** action, making it easier to recover.

::: zone pivot="chromeos"
Chrome Enterprise and the Google Admin console refer to devices in lost mode as *disabled*. For more information about how to disable a device, see the Chrome Enterprise and Education Help documentation.
