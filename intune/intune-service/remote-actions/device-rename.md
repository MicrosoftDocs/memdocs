# Remote device action: rename

The *rename device* remote action in Microsoft Intune allows IT administrators to change the *Device name* displayed in the Intune admin center for a managed device. This action does not affect the *Management name* in Intune or the *Device name* shown in the Company Portal.

Renaming a device can help improve clarity and consistency across your device inventoryâ€”especially in environments with shared devices, standardized naming conventions, or large-scale deployments. It's useful for aligning device names with asset tags, user roles, or location-based identifiers, making it easier to manage and troubleshoot devices at scale.

## How to bulk rename devices from the Intune admin center

You can choose to rename devices in bulk, based on the device platform. The bulk rename option uses the same rules as renaming a single device. However, you must also include one of the following variables as part of the device name:

- `{{serialnumber}}` - Add the device's serial number to the name.
- `{{rand:x}}` - Add a random string of numbers, where x equals the number of digits to add.

To use the bulk rename action:

1. In the [Microsoft Intune admin center][INT-AC], select **Devices** > [**All devices**][INT-ALLD].
1. Select **Bulk Device Actions**.
1. On the Basics page, for **OS** select the platform of the devices you want to rename, and then for **Device action** select **Rename**.
1. Complete the configuration wizard.
