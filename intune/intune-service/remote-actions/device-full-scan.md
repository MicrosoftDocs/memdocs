# Remote device action: full scan

The *full scan* remote action in Intune lets IT admins trigger a comprehensive malware scan on managed Windows devices using Microsoft Defender Antivirus. It checks all files and running processes, helping detect threats missed by quick scans.

This action is ideal when a device is suspected of compromise or when validating security baselines. Instead of waiting for scheduled scans or relying on user action, admins can launch a full scan directly from the Intune admin center.

## Requirements

[!INCLUDE [platform-requirements](../../includes/h3/platform-requirements.md)]

> [!div class="checklist"]
> This remote action supports the following platforms:
>
> - Windows

[!INCLUDE [rbac-requirements](../../includes/h3/rbac-requirements.md)]

> [!div class="checklist"]
> To run this remote action, use an account with at least one of the following roles:
>
> - [Help Desk Operator][INT-R1]
> - [Endpoint Security Manager][INT-R4]
> - [Custom role][INT-RC] that includes:
>   - The permission **Remote tasks/Windows defender**
>   - Permissions that provide visibility into and access to managed devices in Intune (e.g. Organization/Read, Managed devices/Read)

## How to initiate a full scan from the Intune admin center
