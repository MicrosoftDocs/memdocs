With the *shut down* action, IT administrators can remotely power off managed devices. This action doesn't prompt or warn the user before the device powers down.

> [!div class="checklist"]
> This remote action supports the following platforms:
>
> - iOS/iPadOS in [Supervised Mode][IOS-SUP]
> - macOS

[!INCLUDE [rbac-requirements](../includes/h3/rbac-requirements.md)]

> [!div class="checklist"]
> To run this remote action, use an account with at least one of the following roles:
>
> - [Help Desk Operator][INT-R1]
> - [School Administrator][INT-R2]
> - [Endpoint Security Manager][INT-R4]
> - [Custom role][INT-RC] that includes:

## How to shut down a device from the Intune admin center

1. In the [Microsoft Intune admin center][INT-AC], select **Devices** > [**All devices**][INT-ALLD].
1. From the devices list, select a device.
1. At the top of the device overview pane, find the row of remote action icons. Select **Shut down** > **Yes**.

> [!NOTE]
> iOS/iPadOS devices that are Passcode-locked will not rejoin a Wi-Fi network after restarting. After restarting, the device might not be able to communicate with the server.
