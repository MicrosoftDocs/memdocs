# Remotely lock devices using Intune

The **Remote lock** device action locks a managed device so the user must enter the existing passcode or PIN to continue. Use this action when a device is misplaced, left unattended, or suspected of unauthorized use without wiping data or removing enrollment.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Remote lock is only effective if a passcode or PIN is already set:
> - If no passcode exists, the screen may just turn off and the user can still access the device.
> - Enforce a passcode policy before relying on this action.

## How to remote lock a device from the Intune admin center

1. In the [Microsoft Intune admin center][INT-AC], select **Devices** > [**All devices**][INT-ALLD].
1. From the devices list, select a device.
1. At the top of the device overview pane, locate the row of remote action icons. Select **Remote lock**.
::: zone pivot="macos"
3. Set a six-digit recovery PIN.

> [!NOTE]
> The recovery PIN is shown on the device overview pane for up to 30 days, or until another device action is sent. Record it securely; it can't be retrieved afterward. Don't resend remote lock to the same macOS device until that PIN is usedâ€”additional attempts show a **Failed** status in reporting.
