# Remote device action: restart

The *restart* remote action triggers a restart (usually begins within 5 minutes) and might not show a warning to the signed-in user.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The restart depends on the device receiving a push notification. If the device is offline or push notifications are blocked, the restart is delayed until connectivity resumes.

## Requirements

[!INCLUDE [platform-requirements](../includes/h3/platform-requirements.md)]

> [!div class="checklist"]
> This remote action supports the following platforms:
> - Android Enterprise corporate-owned Fully Managed (COBO)
> - Android Enterprise corporate-owned Dedicated (COSU)
> - Android Open Source Project (AOSP)

> - macOS
> - Windows
> - ChromeOS (kiosk mode or managed guest session)

## How to restart a device from the Intune admin center

## User experience
::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="ios"
A passcode-locked device can't reconnect to Wi-Fi until the user unlocks it. Apple encrypts saved Wi-Fi credentials until unlock. Until then, Intune can't communicate with the device.

::: zone pivot="windows"
When the 5â€‘minute restart timer starts, Windows attempts to show the notification: *Your device administrator has scheduled a reboot.* Delivering the restart command requires Windows Notification Services (WNS).

For more information about WNS, see [Network endpoint requirements](../fundamentals/intune-endpoints.md#windows-push-notification-services-wns-dependencies).
