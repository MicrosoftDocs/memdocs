# Remotely restart devices with Intune

The **Restart** remote action triggers a restart (usually begins within 5 minutes) and might not show a warning to the signed-in user.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The restart depends on the device receiving a push notification. If the device is offline or push notifications are blocked, the restart is delayed until connectivity resumes.

## Restart a device

    > [All devices][INT-AC1]
1. From the devices list, select a device, and then select **Restart** > **Yes**.

## User experience

::: zone pivot="ios"
A passcode-locked device can't reconnect to Wi-Fi until the user unlocks it. Apple encrypts saved Wi-Fi credentials until unlock. Until then, Intune can't communicate with the device.
:::endzone

::: zone pivot="windows"
When the 5â€‘minute restart timer starts, Windows attempts to show the notification: *Your device administrator has scheduled a reboot.* Delivering the restart command requires Windows Notification Services (WNS).

For more information about WNS, see [Network endpoint requirements](../fundamentals/intune-endpoints.md#windows-push-notification-services-wns-dependencies).
