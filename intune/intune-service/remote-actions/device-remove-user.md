# Remote device action: remove user

> This remote action is supported on the following platform:
>
> - iPadOS (Shared iPad mode only)

>   - The permission **Remote tasks/Manage shared device users**
>   - Permissions that provide visibility into and access to managed devices in Intune (e.g. Organization/Read, Managed devices/Read)
