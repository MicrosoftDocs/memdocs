# Autopilot reset using Intune

[Link](/autopilot/windows-autopilot-reset#reset-devices-with-remote-windows-autopilot-reset)

Exec on this node triggers Autopilot Reset operation. This works like PC Reset, similar to other existing nodes in this RemoteWipe CSP, except that it keeps the device enrolled in Microsoft Entra ID and MDM, keeps Wi-Fi profiles, and a few other settings like region, language, keyboard.

<div data-bind="&quot;text&quot;:data.text" class="fxs-messagebox-text" id="messagebox0-000">Windows Autopilot Reset quickly removes personal files, apps, and settings. It resets devices running Windows 10 and later from the lock screen, and applies original management settings from Microsoft Entra ID and Intune device management. This returns the device to a fully configured or known IT-approved state. (If an enrollment status page wasn't configured for this device during initial device enrollment, the device will go straight to the desktop after sign-in. It might take up to eight hours to sync and appear compliant in Intune.)</div>

From portal:

/wipe
{keepUserData: "false", keepEnrollmentData: "true"}
