## Remove a device from Microsoft Entra ID

After executing the remote action on a device from Intune, you might also want to remove its record from Microsoft Entra ID to fully disconnect it from your organization's identity infrastructure. This step helps ensure that the device no longer appears in your tenant, avoids potential confusion in device inventory, and prevents lingering access permissions or stale records that could affect compliance or reporting.

For more information about removing devices from Microsoft Entra ID, see [Manage stale devices in Microsoft Entra ID](/entra/identity/devices/manage-stale-devices).
