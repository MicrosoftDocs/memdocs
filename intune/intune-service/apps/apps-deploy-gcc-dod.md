# Deploying Apps Using Intune on the GCC High and DoD Environments

Microsoft Intune can be used by tenant administrators to distribute apps to their workforce. The workforce is the company employee, the users of the apps. There are many types of apps that can be deployed from Intune on GCC High or DoD environments. If an administrator needs to upload and distribute a Windows app intended for a GCC High or DoD audience that is custom-made, created by third-party vendors, the admin can choose to distribute it as a [line-of-business app](apps-add.md#app-types-in-microsoft-intune).

## Add Windows apps using Intune

To add a Windows line-of-business app or a Win32 app intended for a GCC High or DoD environment using Intune, you can follow the [Windows LOB app](lob-apps-windows.md) or [Win32 app management](apps-win32-app-management.md) instructions. If you choose to use the Company Portal, you can manually install and deploy the Company Portal. For more information, see [How to configure the Microsoft Intune Company Portal app](company-portal-app.md).

## Compliance

Review the privacy and compliance statements of apps and compare them to the compliance, security and privacy requirements of your organization when assessing the appropriate use of these services.

## Next steps

To learn more about deploying and assigning apps, see [Assign apps to groups with Microsoft Intune](apps-deploy.md).
