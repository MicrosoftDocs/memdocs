# Android App Protection Policy Settings in Microsoft Intune
This article describes the app protection policy settings for Android devices. The policy settings that are described can be [configured](app-protection-policies.md) for an app protection policy on the **Settings** pane in the portal.
There are three categories of policy settings: data protection settings, access requirements, and conditional launch. In this article, the term *policy-managed apps* refers to apps that are configured with app protection policies.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Intune Company Portal is required on the device to receive App Protection Policies for Android devices.
>
> The Intune Managed Browser is retired. Use [Microsoft Edge](../apps/manage-microsoft-edge.md) for your protected Intune browser experience.

## Data protection
### Data Transfer
|Setting |How to use |Default value |
|:------|:------|:------|
|**Backup org data to Android backup services** |Select **Block** to prevent this app from backing up work or school data to the [Android Backup Service](https://developer.android.com/google/backup/index.html).<br><br> Select **Allow** to allow this app to back up work or school data.|**Allow** |
|**Send org data to other apps** |Specify what apps can receive data from this app: <ul><li> **Policy managed apps**: Allow transfer only to other policy-managed apps.</li> <li>**All Apps**: Allow transfer to any app. </li> <li>**None**: Don't allow data transfer to any app, including other policy-managed apps.</li></ul> <p>There are some exempt apps and services to which Intune can allow data transfer by default. In addition, you can create your own exemptions if you need to allow data to transfer to an app that doesn't support Intune APP. For more information, see [Data transfer exemptions](app-protection-policy-settings-android.md#data-transfer-exemptions).<p>This policy can also apply to Android App Links. General web links are managed by the **Open app links in Intune Managed Browser** policy setting.<p><div class="NOTE"><p>Note</p><p>Intune doesn't currently support the Android Instant Apps feature. Intune blocks any data connection to or from the app. For more information, see [Android Instant Apps](https://developer.android.com/topic/instant-apps/index.html) in the Android Developer documentation.</p><p>If **Send org data to other apps** is configured to **All Apps**, text data can still be transferred via OS sharing to the clipboard.</p></div> |**All Apps** |
|<ul><b>**Select apps to exempt** |This option is available when you select *Policy managed apps* for the previous option. ||
|<ul><b>**Save copies of org data** |Choose **Block** to disable the use of the Save As option in this app. Choose **Allow** if you want to allow the use of *Save As*.

|<ul><b>**Open data into Org documents** |Select **Block** to disable the use of the *Open* option or other options to share data between accounts in this app. Select **Allow** if you want to allow the use of *Open*. <br><br>When set to **Block** you can configure the **Allow user to open data from selected services** to specific which services are allowed for Org data locations.<br><br>**Note:**<ul><li><i>This setting is only configurable when the setting **Receive data from other apps** is set to **Policy managed apps**.</i></li><li><i>This setting is "Allow" when the setting **Receive data from other apps** is set to **All Apps**.</i></li><li><i>This setting is "Block" with no allowed service locations when the setting **Receive data from other apps** is set to **None**.</i></li><li><i>The following apps support this setting:</i><ul><li><i>OneDrive 6.14.1 or later.</i></li><li><i>Outlook for Android 4.2039.2 or later.</i></li><li><i>Teams for Android 1416/1.0.0.2021173701 or later.</i></li></ul></li></ul> |<br><br> **Allow** |
|<ul><b><ul><b>**Allow users to open data from selected services** |Select the application storage services that users can open data from. All other services are blocked. Selecting no services prevents users from opening data.<br><br>Supported services:<ul><li>OneDrive for Business</li><li>SharePoint Online</li><li>Camera</li><li>Photo Library</li></ul>**Note:** Camera doesn't include Photos or Photo Gallery access. When selecting **Photo Library** (includes Android's [Photo picker](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/shared/photopicker) tool) in the **Allow users to open data from selected services** setting within Intune, you can allow managed accounts to allow *incoming* image/video from their device's local storage to their managed apps. |**All selected**  |
|**Restrict cut, copy and paste between other apps** |Specify when cut, copy, and paste actions can be used with this app. Choose from: <ul><li>**Blocked**:  Don't allow cut, copy, and paste actions between this app and any other app.</li><li>**Policy managed apps**: Allow cut, copy, and paste actions between this app and other policy-managed apps.</li><li>**Policy managed with paste in**: Allow cut or copy between this app and other policy-managed apps. Allow data from any app to be pasted into this app.</li><li>**Any app**: No restrictions for cut, copy, and paste to and from this app.</ul>**Note**: When using third-party keyboards, users may see the message “Your organization's data cannot be pasted here” in the keyboard’s clipboard preview during copy actions. This occurs if the keyboard app is not integrated with Intune and hence cannot decrypt the encoded clipboard text. Users can still copy and paste data as expected using the paste text action within managed apps if allowed by the organization. |**Any app** |
|<ul><b>**Cut and copy character limit for any app** |Specify the number of characters that can be cut or copied from org data and accounts. This allows sharing of the specified number of characters to any app, including unmanaged apps, when it would be otherwise blocked by the "Restrict cut, copy, and paste with other apps" setting.<p>Default Value = 0<p>**Note**: Requires Intune Company Portal version 5.0.4364.0 or later. |**0** |
|**Screen capture and Google Assistant** |Select **Block** to block screen capture, block **Circle to Search**, and block **Google Assistant** accessing org data on the device when using this app. Choosing **Block** also blurs the App-switcher preview image when using this app with a work or school account.<p>**Note**: Google Assistant might be accessible to users for scenarios that don't access org data. |**Allow**|
|**Approved keyboards**  |Select *Require* and then specify a list of approved keyboards for this policy. <p>Users who aren't using an approved keyboard receive a prompt to download and install an approved keyboard before they can use the protected app. This setting requires the app to have the Intune SDK for Android version 6.2.0 or later. |**Not required** |
|<ul><b>**Select keyboards to approve** |This option is available when you select *Require* for the previous option. Choose *Select* to manage the list of keyboards and input methods that can be used with apps protected by this policy. You can add more keyboards to the list, and remove any of the default options. You must have at least one approved keyboard to save the setting. Over time, Microsoft might add more keyboards to the list for new App Protection Policies, which requires administrators to review and update existing policies as needed.<p>To add a keyboard, specify: <ul><li>**Name**: A friendly name that that identifies the keyboard, and is visible to the user. </li><li>**Package ID**:  The Package ID of the app in the Google Play store. For example, if the URL for the app in the Play store is `https://play.google.com/store/details?id=com.contoskeyboard.android.prod`, then the Package ID is `com.contosokeyboard.android.prod`. This package ID is presented to the user as a simple link to download the keyboard from Google Play.</li></ul></p> <p>**Note:** A user assigned multiple App Protection Policies are allowed to use only the approved keyboards common to all policies.</p> ||

### Encryption
|Setting |How to use |Default value |
|:------|:------|:------|
|**Encrypt org data** |Choose **Require** to enable encryption of work or school data in this app. Intune uses a wolfSSL, 256-bit AES encryption scheme along with the Android Keystore system to securely encrypt app data. Data is encrypted synchronously during file I/O tasks. Content on the device storage is always encrypted and can only be opened by apps that support Intune's app protection policies and have policy assigned. New files encrypt with 256-bit keys. Existing 128-bit encrypted files undergo a migration attempt to 256-bit keys, but the process isn't guaranteed. Files encrypted with 128-bit keys remain readable. <br><br> The encryption method is FIPS 140-2 validated; for more information, see [wolfCrypt FIPS 140-2 and FIPS 140-3](https://www.wolfssl.com/license/fips/). |**Require**|
|<ul><b>**Encrypt org data on enrolled devices** |Select **Require** to enforce encrypting org data with Intune app layer encryption on all devices. Select **Not required** to not enforce encrypting org data with Intune app layer encryption on enrolled devices.|**Require** |


### Functionality
|Setting |How to use |Default value |
|:------|:------|:------|
|  **Sync policy managed app data with native apps or add-ins** | Choose Block to prevent policy managed apps from saving data to the device's native apps (Contacts, Calendar, and widgets) and to prevent the use of add-ins within the policy managed apps. If not supported by the application, saving data to native apps and using add-ins are allowed. <br><br>If you choose Allow, the policy managed app can save data to the native apps or use add-ins, if those features are supported and enabled within the policy managed app.<br><br>Applications might provide extra controls to customize the data sync behavior to specific native apps or not honor this control. <br><br>**Note**: When you perform a selective wipe to remove work, or school data from the app, data synced directly from the policy managed app to the native app is removed. Any data synced from the native app to another external source won't be wiped. <br><br>**Note**: *The following apps support this feature: <ul><li>Outlook for Android see [Deploying Outlook for iOS and Android app configuration settings](/exchange/clients-and-mobile-in-exchange-online/outlook-for-ios-and-android/outlook-for-ios-and-android-configuration-with-microsoft-intune)</li>*</ul> |**Allow** |
|**Printing Org data** |Choose **Block** to prevent the app from printing work or school data. If you leave this setting to **Allow**, the default value, users can export and print all Org data. |**Allow** |
|**Restrict web content transfer with other apps** |Specify how web content (http/https links) is opened from policy-managed applications. Choose from: <ul><li>**Any app**: Allow web links in any app.</li><li>**Microsoft Edge**: Allow web content to open only in the Microsoft Edge. This browser is a policy-managed browser.</li><li>**Unmanaged browser**: Allow web content to open only in the unmanaged browser defined by **Unmanaged browser protocol** setting. The web content is unmanaged in the target browser.<br>**Note**: Requires Intune Company Portal version 5.0.4415.0 or later.</li><br><p>Android App Links are managed by the **Allow app to transfer data to other apps** policy setting.<p>**Intune device enrollment**<br>If you're using Intune to manage your devices, see [Manage Internet access using managed browser policies with Microsoft Intune](manage-microsoft-edge.md).<p>**Policy-managed Microsoft Edge**<br>The Microsoft Edge browser for mobile devices (iOS/iPadOS and Android) supports Intune app protection policies. Users who sign in with their corporate Microsoft Entra accounts in the Microsoft Edge browser application are protected by Intune. The Microsoft Edge browser integrates the APP SDK and supports all of its data protection policies, except for preventing:<br><ul><li>**Save-as**: The Microsoft Edge browser doesn't allow a user to add direct, in-app connections to cloud storage providers (such as OneDrive).</li><li>**Contact sync**: The Microsoft Edge browser doesn't save to native contact lists.</li></ul>**Note:** *The APP SDK can't determine if a target app is a browser. On Android devices, other managed browser apps that support the http/https intent are allowed.* |**Not configured** |
|<ul><b>**Unmanaged Browser ID** |Enter the application ID for a single browser. Web content (http/https links) from policy managed applications opens in the specified browser. The web content is unmanaged in the target browser. |**Blank** |
|<ul><b>**Unmanaged Browser Name** |Enter the application name for browser associated with the **Unmanaged Browser ID**. This name is displayed to users if the specified browser isn't installed.|**Blank** |
|**Org data notifications** |Specify how much org data is shared via OS notifications for org accounts. This policy setting affects the local device and any connected devices such as wearables and smart speakers. Apps might provide extra controls to customize notification behavior or might choose to not honor all values. Select from: <ul><li>**Block**:  Don't share notifications.</li><ul><li>If not supported by the application, notifications are allowed.</li></ul><li>**Block org data**: Don't share org data in notifications. For example, "You have new mail"; "You have a meeting."</li><UL><li>If not supported by the application, notifications are blocked.</li></ul><li>**Allow**: Shares org data in the notifications</li></ul> <p>**Note**: *This setting requires app support: <ul><li>Outlook for Android 4.0.95 or later</li><li>Teams for Android 1416/1.0.0.2020092202 or later.*</ul> |**Allow** |

## Data transfer exemptions

There are some exempt apps and platform services that Intune app protection policies allow data transfer to and from. For example, all Intune-managed apps on Android must be able to transfer data to and from the Google Text-to-speech, so that text from your mobile device screen can be read aloud. This list is subject to change and reflects the services and apps considered useful for secure productivity.

## Access requirements

|Setting |How to use |
|:------ |:------|
|**PIN for access** |Select **Require** to require a PIN to use this app. The user is prompted to set up this PIN the first time they run the app in a work or school context. <br><br> Default value = **Require**<br><br> You can configure the PIN strength using the settings available under the PIN for access section.<br><br> **Note:** End-users that are allowed to access the app can reset the app PIN. This setting might not be visible in some cases on Android devices. Android devices have a maximum limitation of four available shortcuts. When the maximum has been reached, the end user must remove any personalized shortcuts (or access the shortcut from a different managed app view) to view the reset APP PIN shortcut. Alternatively, the end user could pin the shortcut to their homepage.
|<ol><br>**PIN type** |Set a requirement for either numeric or passcode type PINs before accessing an app that has app protection policies applied. Numeric requirements involve only numbers, while a passcode can be defined with at least 1 alphabetical letter **or** at least 1 special character. <br><br> Default value = **Numeric**<br><br> **Note:** Special characters allowed include the special characters and symbols on the Android English language keyboard. |
|<ul><b> **Simple PIN** |Select **Allow** to allow users to use simple PIN sequences like *1234*, *1111*, *abcd* or *aaaa*. Select **Blocks** to prevent them from using simple sequences. Simple sequences are checked in 3 character sliding windows. If **Block** is configured, 1235 or 1112 wouldn't be accepted as PIN set by the end user, but 1122 would be allowed. <br><br>Default value = **Allow** <br><br>**Note:** If Passcode type PIN is configured, and Simple PIN is set to Allow, the user needs at least one letter **or** at least one special character in their PIN. If Passcode type PIN is configured, and Simple PIN is set to Block, the user needs at least one number **and** one letter **and** at least one special character in their PIN. </li> |
|<ul><b> **Select minimum PIN length** |Specify the minimum number of digits in a PIN sequence. <br><br>Default value = **4** |
|<ul><b>**Biometrics instead of PIN for access** |Select **Allow** to allow the user to use biometrics to authenticate users on Android devices. If allowed, biometrics is used to access the app on Android 10 or higher devices. |
|<ul><b>**Override biometric with PIN after timeout** |To use this setting, select **Require** and then configure an inactivity timeout. <br><br>Default value = **Require** |
|<ul><b><ul><b> **Timeout (minutes of inactivity)** |Specify a time in minutes after which either a passcode or numeric (as configured) PIN overrides the use of a biometric. This timeout value should be greater than the value specified under 'Recheck the access requirements after (minutes of inactivity)'.<br><br>Default value = **30** |
|<ul><b> **Class 3 biometrics (Android 9.0+)** | Select **Require** to require the user to sign in with class 3 biometrics. For more information on class 3 biometrics, see [Biometrics](https://source.android.com/docs/security/biometric) in Google's documentation. |
|<ul><b> **Override biometrics with PIN after biometric updates** | Select **Require** to override the use of biometrics with PIN when a change in biometrics is detected.<p><p>**NOTE:**<br>This setting only takes effect once a biometric has been used to access the app. Depending on the Android device manufacturer, not all forms of biometrics might be supported for cryptographic operations. Currently, cryptographic operations are supported for any biometric (for example, fingerprint, iris, or face) on the device that meets or exceeds the requirements for Class 3 biometrics, as defined in the Android documentation. See the `BIOMETRIC_STRONG` constant of the [BiometricManager.Authenticators](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/biometrics/BiometricManager.Authenticators#BIOMETRIC_STRONG) interface and the `authenticate` method of the [BiometricPrompt](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/biometrics/BiometricPrompt#authenticate(android.hardware.biometrics.BiometricPrompt.CryptoObject,%20android.os.CancellationSignal,%20java.util.concurrent.Executor,%20android.hardware.biometrics.BiometricPrompt.AuthenticationCallback)) class. You might need to contact your device manufacturer to understand the device-specific limitations. |
|<ul><b>**PIN reset after number of days** |Select **Yes** to require users to change their app PIN after a set period of time, in days.  <br><br>When set to *Yes*, you then configure the number of days before the PIN reset is required. <br><br> Default value = **No** |
|<ul><b><ul><b> **Number of days** |Configure the number of days before the PIN reset is required. <br><br> Default value = **90**  |
|<ul><b>**Select number of previous PIN values to maintain** |This setting specifies the number of previous PINs that Intune maintains. Any new PINs must be different from those that Intune is maintaining. <br><br> Default value = **0** |
|<ul><b>**App PIN when device PIN is set** |Select **Not required** to disable the app PIN when a device lock is detected on an enrolled device with Company Portal configured. <br><br> Default value = **Require**. |
|**Work or school account credentials for access** |Choose **Require** to require the user to sign in with their work or school account instead of entering a PIN for app access. When set to **Require**, and PIN or biometric prompts are turned on, both corporate credentials and either the PIN or biometric prompts are shown. <br><br>Default value = **Not required** |
|**Recheck the access requirements after (minutes of inactivity)** |Configure the following setting: <ul><li>**Timeout**: This setting is the number of minutes before the access requirements (defined earlier in the policy) are rechecked. For example, an admin turns on PIN and Blocks rooted devices in the policy, a user opens an Intune-managed app, must enter a PIN, and must be using the app on a nonrooted device. When using this setting, the user won't have to enter a PIN or undergo another root-detection check on any Intune-managed app for a period of time equal to the configured value. <br><br>This policy setting format supports a positive whole number. <br><br> Default value = **30 minutes** <br><br> **Note:** On Android, the PIN is shared with all Intune-managed apps. The PIN timer is reset once the app leaves the foreground on the device. The user won't have to enter a PIN on any Intune-managed app that shares its PIN for the duration of the timeout defined in this setting. <br><br></li> |

> [!NOTE]
> To learn more about how multiple Intune app protection settings configured in the Access section to the same set of apps and users work on Android, see [Intune MAM frequently asked questions](mam-faq.yml) and [Selectively wipe data using app protection policy access actions in Intune](app-protection-policies-access-actions.md).

## Conditional launch
Configure conditional launch settings to set sign-in security requirements for your app protection policy.

By default, several settings are provided with preconfigured values and actions. You can delete some settings, like the *Min OS version*. You can also select more settings from the **Select one** dropdown.

### App conditions

|Setting |How to use |
|:----|:-----|
|**Max PIN attempts** |Specify the number of tries the user has to successfully enter their PIN before the configured action is taken. If the user fails to successfully enter their PIN after the maximum PIN attempts, the user must reset their pin after successfully logging into their account and completing a multifactor authentication (MFA) challenge if necessary. This policy setting format supports a positive whole number.<p>*Actions* include: <br><ul><li>**Reset PIN** - The user must reset their PIN.</li><li>**Wipe data** - The user account that is associated with the application is wiped from the device.</li></ul>Default value = **5** |
|**Offline grace period** |The number of minutes that managed apps can run offline. Specify the time (in minutes) before the access requirements for the app are rechecked.<p>*Actions* include: <br><ul><li>**Block access (minutes)** - The number of minutes that managed apps can run offline. Specify the time (in minutes) before the access requirements for the app are rechecked. After this period expires, the app requires user authentication to Microsoft Entra ID so that the app can continue to run. <br><br>This policy setting format supports a positive whole number. <br><br>Default value = **1440** minutes (24 hours) <br><br><b>Note:</b> Configuring the Offline grace period timer for blocking access to be less than the default value might result in more frequent user interruptions as policy is refreshed. Choosing a value of less than 30 mins isn't recommended as it might result in user interruptions at each application launch or resume.</li><li>**Wipe data (days)** - After this many days (defined by the admin) of running offline, the app requires the user to connect to the network and reauthenticate. If the user successfully authenticates, they can continue to access their data and the offline interval resets. If the user fails to authenticate, the app performs a selective wipe of the user's account and data. For more information, see [How to wipe only corporate data from Intune-managed apps](apps-selective-wipe.md). This policy setting format supports a positive whole number. <br><br> Default value = **90 days** </li></ul> This entry can appear multiple times, with each instance supporting a different action. |
|**Min app version** |Specify a value for the minimum application version value.<p>*Actions* include: <br><ul><li>**Warn** - The user sees a notification if the app version on the device doesn't meet the requirement. This notification can be dismissed.</li><li>**Block access** - The user is blocked from access if the app version on the device doesn't meet the requirement. </li><li>**Wipe data** - The user account that is associated with the application is wiped from the device. </li></ul> </li></ul> As apps often have distinct versioning schemes between them, create a policy with one minimum app version targeting one app (for example, *Outlook version policy*).<br><br> This entry can appear multiple times, with each instance supporting a different action.<br><br> This policy setting format supports either major.minor, major.minor.build, major.minor.build.revision.<br><br> Also, you can configure **where** your end users can get an updated version of a line-of-business (LOB) app. End users see this in the **min app version** conditional launch dialog, which prompts end users to update to a minimum version of the LOB app. On Android, this feature uses the Company Portal. To configure where an end user should update a LOB app, the app needs a managed [app configuration policy](app-configuration-policies-managed-app.md) sent to it with the key, `com.microsoft.intune.myappstore`. The value sent defines which store the end user downloads the app from. If the app is deployed via the Company Portal, the value must be `CompanyPortal`.

|**Device manufacturers** |Specify a semicolon separated list of manufacturers. These values aren't case sensitive. *Actions* include: <br><ul><li>**Allow specified (Block non-specified)** - Only devices that match the specified manufacturer can use the app. All other devices are blocked. </li></ul> <ul><li>**Allow specified (Wipe non-specified)** - The user account that is associated with the application is wiped from the device. </li></ul> For more information on using this setting, see [Conditional Launch actions](app-protection-policies-access-actions.md#android-policy-settings). |
|**Play integrity verdict** |App protection policies support some of Google Play Integrity APIs. This setting in particular configures [Google's Play Integrity](https://developer.android.com/google/play/integrity) check on end user devices to validate the integrity of those devices. Specify either **Basic integrity** or **Basic integrity and device integrity**. <p>**Basic integrity** tells you about the general integrity of the device. Rooted devices, emulators, virtual devices, and devices with signs of tampering fail basic integrity. **Basic integrity & certified devices** tells you about the compatibility of the device with Google's services. Only unmodified devices certified by Google can pass this check.<p>If you select **Play integrity verdict** as required for conditional launch, you can specify that a strong integrity check is used as the evaluation type. The presence of a strong integrity check as the evaluation type indicates greater integrity of a device. The MAM policy blocks devices that don't support strong integrity checks if they're targeted with this setting. The strong integrity check provides a more robust root detection in response to newer types of rooting tools and methods that can't always be reliably detected by a software only solution. Within APP, hardware attestation is enabled by setting **Play integrity verdict evaluation type** to **Check strong integrity** once **Play integrity verdict** is configured, and **Required SafetyNet evaluation type** to **strong integrity check** once **Device integrity check** is configured. Hardware backed attestation uses a hardware-based component that shipped with devices installed with Android 8.1 and later. Devices that were upgraded from an older version of Android to Android 8.1 are unlikely to have the hardware-based components necessary for hardware backed attestation. While this setting should be widely supported starting with devices that shipped with Android 8.1, Microsoft strongly recommends testing devices individually before enabling this policy setting broadly.<p>**Important:** Devices that don't support this evaluation type are blocked or wiped based on the Device integrity check action. Organizations that would like to use this functionality need to ensure users have supported devices. For more information on Google's recommended devices, see [Android Enterprise Recommended requirements](https://www.android.com/enterprise/recommended/requirements/).<p>*Actions* include: <br><ul><li>**Warn** - The user sees a notification if the device doesn't meet Google's device integrity check based on the value configured. This notification can be dismissed. </li></ul><ul><li>**Block access** - The user is blocked from access if the device doesn't meet Google's device integrity check based on the value configured. </li></ul> <ul><li>**Wipe data** - The user account that is associated with the application is wiped from the device. </li></ul> </li></ul> For commonly asked questions related to this setting, see [Frequently asked questions about MAM and app protection](mam-faq.yml). |
|**Require threat scan on apps** |App protection policies support some of Google Play Protect's APIs. This setting in particular ensures that Google's Verify Apps scan is turned on for end user devices. If configured, the end user is blocked from access until they turn on Google's app scanning on their Android device. *Actions* include: <br><ul><li>**Warn** - The user sees a notification if Google's Verify Apps scan on the device isn't turned on. This notification can be dismissed. </li></ul><ul><li>**Block access** - The user is blocked from access if Google's Verify Apps scan on the device isn't turned on. </li></ul></li></ul> Results from Google's Verify Apps scan are surfaced in the **Potentially Harmful Apps** report in the console. |
|**Required SafetyNet evaluation type** | Hardware backed attestation enhances the existing SafetyNet attestation service check. You can set the value to **Hardware-backed key** after setting **SafteyNet device attestation**. |
|**Require device lock** |This setting determines whether the Android device has a device PIN that meets the minimum password requirement. The App protection policy can take action if the device lock doesn't meet the minimum password requirement.<p><p>**Values** include:<br><ul><li>**Low Complexity**</li><li>**Medium Complexity**</li><li>**High Complexity**</li></ul><p>This complexity value is targeted to Android 12+. For devices operating on Android 11 and earlier, setting a complexity value of low, medium, or high defaults to the expected behavior for **Low Complexity**. For more information, see Google's developer documentation [getPasswordComplexity](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/admin/DevicePolicyManager#getPasswordComplexity%28%29), [PASSWORD_COMPLEXITY_LOW](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/admin/DevicePolicyManager#PASSWORD_COMPLEXITY_LOW), [PASSWORD_COMPLEXITY_MEDIUM](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/admin/DevicePolicyManager#PASSWORD_COMPLEXITY_MEDIUM), and [PASSWORD_COMPLEXITY_HIGH](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/admin/DevicePolicyManager#PASSWORD_COMPLEXITY_HIGH).<p>**Actions** include:<br><ul><li>**Warn** - The user sees a notification if the device lock doesn't meet the minimum password requirement. The notification can be dismissed.</li><li>**Block access** - The user is blocked from access if the device lock doesn't meet the minimum password requirement.</li></ul><ul><li>**Wipe data** - The user account that is associated with the application is wiped from the device if the device lock doesn't meet the minimum password requirement.</li></ul> |
|**Min Company Portal version** |By using the **Min Company Portal version**, you can specify a specific minimum defined version of the Company Portal that is enforced on an end user device. This conditional launch setting allows you to set values to **Block access**, **Wipe data**, and **Warn** as possible actions when each value isn't met. The possible formats for this value follow the pattern *[Major].[Minor]*, *[Major].[Minor].[Build]*, or *[Major].[Minor].[Build].[Revision]*.<p><p>**Note:** Support for Android Company Portal versions earlier than 5.0.5421.0 ended on October 1, 2025.<p><p>Given that some end users might not prefer a forced update of apps on the spot, the 'warn' option might be ideal when configuring this setting. The Google Play Store does a good job of only sending the delta bytes for app updates, but this can still be a large amount of data that that the user might not want to use if they are on data at the time of the update. Forcing an update and thereby downloading an updated app could result in unexpected data charges at the time of the update. For more information, see [Android policy settings](app-protection-policies-access-actions.md#android-policy-settings). |
|**Max Company Portal version age (days)** |You can set a maximum number of days as the age of the Company Portal (CP) version for Android devices. This setting ensures that end users are within a certain range of CP releases (in days). The value must be between 0 and 365 days. When the setting for the devices isn't met, the action for this setting is triggered. Actions include **Block access**, **Wipe data**, or **Warn**. For related information, see [Android policy settings](app-protection-policies-access-actions.md#android-policy-settings). **Note:** The age of the Company Portal build is determined by [Google Play](https://developer.android.com/reference/com/google/android/play/core/appupdate/AppUpdateInfo#clientVersionStalenessDays) on the end user device. |
|**Samsung Knox device attestation** | Specify if the Samsung Knox device attestation check is required. Only unmodified devices that have been verified by Samsung can pass this check. For the list of supported devices, see [samsungknox.com](https://www.samsungknox.com/en/knox-platform/supported-devices/knox-device-attestation).<br><br>By using this setting, Microsoft Intune also verifies communication from the Company Portal to the Intune Service was sent from a healthy device. <br><br>*Actions* include: <br><ul><li>**Warn** - The user sees a notification, if the device doesn't meet Samsung Knox device attestation check. This notification can be dismissed on supported Samsung devices.</li><li>**Block access** - The user account is blocked from access, if the device doesn't meet Samsung's Knox device attestation check.</li><li>**Wipe data** - The user account that is associated with the application is wiped from the device, if the device doesn't meet Samsung Knox device attestation check.</li><li>**Block access on supported devices** - The user account is blocked from access, if a Samsung device running Android 15 with One UI 7.0 or above doesn't meet Samsung's Knox device attestation check. Samsung devices running on older OS or devices from another manufacturer aren't affected by this choice.</li></ul><p>**Note:** Be aware when selecting "Warn," "Block access," and "Wipe Data" actions:<ul><li>These settings apply to all targeted devices Samsung and other manufacturers.</li><li> On non-Samsung devices, users can't accept the Knox terms of service and are blocked. Use "Managed apps" assignment filters to target only supported Samsung devices. For more information on assignment filters, see [Use filters when assigning your apps, policies, and profiles in Microsoft Intune](../fundamentals/filters.md). </li><li>Samsung devices running versions One UI 7.0 or earlier require users to accept the Samsung Knox terms before the device attestation check can be performed. If it isn't accepted, the specified action occurs.</li></ul></p>|
|**Max allowed device threat level** |App protection policies can take advantage of the Intune-MTD connector. Specify a maximum threat level acceptable to use this app. Threats are determined by your chosen Mobile Threat Defense (MTD) vendor app on the end user device. Specify either *Secured*, *Low*, *Medium*, or *High*. *Secured* requires no threats on the device and is the most restrictive configurable value, while *High* essentially requires an active Intune-to-MTD connection.<p>*Actions* include: <br><ul><li>**Block access** - The user is blocked from access if the threat level determined by your chosen Mobile Threat Defense (MTD) vendor app on the end user device doesn't meet this requirement.</li><li>**Wipe data** - The user account that is associated with the application is wiped from the device.</li></ul>For more information on using this setting, see [Enable the Mobile Threat Defense connector in Intune for unenrolled devices](../protect/mtd-enable-unenrolled-devices.md).</li></ul> |
|**Primary MTD service** |If you have configured multiple Intune-MTD connectors, specify the primary MTD vendor app that should be used on the end user device.<p><p>**Values** include:<br><ul><li>**Microsoft Defender for Endpoint** - if the MTD connector is configured, specify Microsoft Defender for Endpoint provides the device threat level information.</li><li>**Mobile Threat Defense (Non-Microsoft)** - if the MTD connector is configured, specify the non-Microsoft MTD provides the device threat level information.</li></ul><p>You must configure the setting "Max allowed device threat level" to use this setting. <p> There are no **Actions** for this setting.|
