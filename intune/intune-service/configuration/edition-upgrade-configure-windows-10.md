# Upgrade Windows editions or switch out of S mode on devices using Microsoft Intune

You can create a Microsoft Intune policy that upgrades Windows editions, or switches out of S mode.

As part of your mobile device management (MDM) solution, you can upgrade your Windows devices. For example, you want to upgrade your Windows Professional devices to Windows Enterprise. Or, you want the Windows device to switch out of S mode.

[Windows S mode](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4456067/windows-10-switch-out-of-s-mode) (opens another Microsoft web site) is designed for security and performance. You can use Intune to switch out of S mode. Switching out of S mode is one way. So once you switch out of S mode, you can't go back to Windows S mode.

For more information, go to [commonly asked questions about S mode](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4020089/windows-10-in-s-mode-faq).

This feature applies to:

- Windows
- Windows Holographic for Business

Intune uses **configuration profiles** to create and customize these settings for your organization's needs. After you add these features in a profile, you can then push or deploy the profile to Windows client devices in your organization. When you deploy the profile, Intune automatically upgrades the devices or switches out of S mode. When the device checks-in with the Intune service, the policy applies and Intune upgrades the device or switches out of S mode.

This article lists the supported upgrade paths, and shows you how to create the device configuration profile. For a list of all the available upgrade and S mode settings you can configure, go to [Windows client device settings to upgrade editions or enable S mode in Intune](edition-upgrade-windows-settings.md).

> [!NOTE]
> If you remove the policy assignment later, the version of Windows on the device isn't reverted. The device continues to run normally.

## Prerequisites

- To install the updated Windows version on the devices that you target with the policy (for Windows client Desktop editions), you need a valid product key. You can use either Multiple Activation Keys (MAK) or Key Management Server (KMS) keys.
- For Windows Holographic editions, you can use a Microsoft license file. The license file includes the licensing information to install the updated edition on all devices that you target with the policy.
- The Windows client devices you assign the policy are enrolled in Microsoft Intune.
- To create the policy, at a minimum, sign in with an account that has the **Policy and Profile Manager** Intune role. For more information, go to [Role-based access control (RBAC) with Microsoft Intune](../fundamentals/role-based-access-control.md).
