# Restrict USB devices and allow specific USB devices using the settings catalog in Microsoft Intune

Many organizations want to block specific types of USB devices, such as USB flash drives or cameras. You might also want to allow specific USB devices, such as a keyboard or mouse.

You can use the settings catalog in Microsoft Intune to configure these settings in a policy, and then deploy this policy to your Windows devices. For more information on the settings catalog, see [Use the settings catalog to configure device settings in Microsoft Intune](settings-catalog.md).

This article shows you:

- How to create a settings catalog policy with USB settings in the Intune admin center
- How to use a log file to troubleshoot devices that shouldn't be blocked

This article applies to:

- Windows

## Prerequisites

- To configure the settings catalog policy, at a minimum, sign into the Intune admin center with the **Policy and Profile manager** role. For information on the built-in roles in Intune, and what they can do, go to [Role-based access control (RBAC) with Microsoft Intune](../fundamentals/role-based-access-control.md).

## Create the profile

This policy gives an example of how to block (or allow) features that affect USB devices. You can use this policy as a starting point, and then add or remove settings as needed for your organization.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431).
2. Select **Devices** > **Manage devices** > **Configuration** > **Create** > **New policy**.
3. Enter the following properties:

    - **Platform**: Select **Windows 10 and later**.
    - **Profile type**: Select **Settings catalog**.

4. Select **Create**.
5. In **Basics**, enter the following properties:

    - **Name**: Enter a descriptive name for the profile. For example, enter **Restrict USB devices**.
    - **Description**: Enter a description for the profile. This setting is optional, but recommended.

6. Select **Next**.
7. In **Configuration settings**, select **Add settings**. In the settings picker, go to **Administrative templates** > **System** > **Device installation** > **Device Installation Restrictions**. Select the following settings:

    - **Allow installation of devices that match any of these Device IDs**
    - **Allow installation of devices using drivers that match these device setup classes**
    - **Prevent installation of devices not described by other policy settings**

    :::image type="content" source="./media/settings-catalog-restrict-usb/settings-catalog-select-device-installation-restrictions.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the Device Installation Restrictions settings in the settings catalog in Microsoft Intune." lightbox="./media/settings-catalog-restrict-usb/settings-catalog-select-device-installation-restrictions.png":::

8. Close the settings picker. Configure the settings you selected:

    - **Allow installation of devices that match any of these Device IDs**: Select **Enabled**. Add the device/hardware IDs for devices you want to allow.

      To get the device/hardware ID, you can use Device Manager, find the device, and look at the properties. For the specific steps, see [find the hardware ID on a Windows device](/windows-hardware/drivers/install/hardware-ids).

      There's also some helpful device ID information at [Deploy and manage device control in Microsoft Defender for Endpoint with Microsoft Intune](/defender-endpoint/device-control-deploy-manage-intune).

    - **Allow installation of devices using drivers that match these device setup classes**: Select **Enabled**. Add the [System-defined device setup classes available to vendors](/windows-hardware/drivers/install/system-defined-device-setup-classes-available-to-vendors) you want to allow.

      In the following image, the **Keyboard**, **Mouse**, and **Multimedia** classes are allowed.

    - **Prevent installation of devices not described by other policy settings**: Select **Enabled**.

    When the settings are enabled and configured, your policy looks similar to the following policy settings:

    :::image type="content" source="./media/settings-catalog-restrict-usb/settings-catalog-restrict-usb-settings-enabled.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the restrict USB settings in the settings catalog in Microsoft Intune." lightbox="./media/settings-catalog-restrict-usb/settings-catalog-restrict-usb-settings-enabled.png":::

9. Select **Next**.
10. In **Scope tags** (optional), assign a tag to filter the profile to specific IT groups, such as `US-NC IT Team` or `JohnGlenn_ITDepartment`. For more information about scope tags, see [Use role-based access control (RBAC) and scope tags for distributed IT](../fundamentals/scope-tags.md).

    Select **Next**.

11. In **Assignments**, select the device groups that will receive the profile. Select **Next**.

12. In **Review + create**, review your settings. When you select **Create**, your changes are saved and the profile is assigned.

## Verify on Windows devices

After the device configuration profile is deployed to your targeted devices, you can confirm that it works correctly.

If a USB device is blocked from installing, then you see a message similar to the following message:

`The installation of this device is forbidden by system policy. Contact your system administrator.`

In the following example, the iPad is blocked because its device ID isn't in the allowed device ID list:

:::image type="content" source="./media/settings-catalog-restrict-usb/device-status.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows a device blocked by an Intune policy." lightbox="./media/settings-catalog-restrict-usb/device-status.png":::

## A device is blocked but should be allowed

Some USB devices have multiple GUIDs, and it's common to miss some GUIDs in your policy settings. As a result, a USB device that's allowed in your settings, might be blocked on the device.

In the following example, in the **Allow installation of devices using drivers that match these device setup classes** setting, the Multimedia class GUID is entered, and the camera is blocked:

:::image type="content" source="./media/settings-catalog-restrict-usb/camera-blocked.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the Windows can't find your camera message on a Windows device." lightbox="./media/settings-catalog-restrict-usb/camera-blocked.png":::

:::image type="content" source="./media/settings-catalog-restrict-usb/cam-blocked.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the camera is blocked by group policy message on a Windows device." lightbox="./media/settings-catalog-restrict-usb/cam-blocked.png":::

**Resolution**:

To find the GUID of your device, use the following steps:

1. On the device, open the `%windir%\inf\setupapi.dev.log` file.
2. In the file:

    1. Search for **Restricted installation of devices not described by policy**.
    2. In this section, find the `Class GUID of device changed to: {GUID}` text. Add this `{GUID}` to your policy.

        In the following example, you see the `Class GUID of device changed to: {36fc9e60-c465-11cf-8056-444553540000}` text:

        ```log

        <<<  [Exit status: FAILURE(0xe0000248)]
        ```

3. In the device configuration profile, go to the **Allow installation of devices using drivers that match these device setup classes** setting, and add the class GUID from the log file.
4. If the issue continues, repeat these steps to add the other class GUIDs until the device is successfully installed.

    In our example, the following class GUIDs are added to the device profile:

    - USB Bus devices (hubs and host controllers): `{36fc9e60-c465-11cf-8056-444553540000}`
    - Human Interface Devices (HID): `{745a17a0-74d3-11d0-b6fe-00a0c90f57da}`
    - Camera devices: `{ca3e7ab9-b4c3-4ae6-8251-579ef933890f}`
    - Imaging devices: `{6bdd1fc6-810f-11d0-bec7-08002be2092f}`

## Common class GUIDs to allow USB devices

- **Keyboard and mouse**: Add the following GUIDs to the device profile:

  - Keyboard: `{4d36e96b-e325-11ce-bfc1-08002be10318}`
