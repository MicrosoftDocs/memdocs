# Android Intune settings catalog settings list

This article lists and describes the Android Enterprise and AOSP settings you can configure in a settings catalog policy in Microsoft Intune. To learn more about the settings catalog, see [Settings catalog overview](settings-catalog.md).

This feature applies to:

- Android Enterprise corporate-owned devices with a work profile (COPE)
- Android Enterprise corporate owned fully managed (COBO)
- Android Enterprise corporate owned dedicated devices (COSU)
- Android Open Source Project (AOSP) corporate-owned userless devices (shared)
- Android Open Source Project (AOSP) corporate-owned user-associated devices (single user)

## Before you begin

- At a minimum, sign into the Intune admin center as a member of the **Policy and Profile Manager** role. For more information on the built-in Intune roles, go to [Role-based access control (RBAC) with Microsoft Intune](../fundamentals/role-based-access-control.md).
- Create a [settings catalog policy](settings-catalog.md).

## Android settings

# [Android Enterprise](#tab/ae)

These settings apply to the Android Enterprise enrollment types where Intune controls the entire device, including the following enrollment types:

- Fully managed devices
- Dedicated devices
- Corporate-owned devices with a work profile

To learn more about the different Android enrollment types, see [Android Enrollment guide](../fundamentals/deployment-guide-enrollment-android.md).

### Device restriction

#### Device Password

  > [!NOTE]
  >
  > - Users on fully managed, and corporate-owned work profile devices aren't prompted to set a password. The settings are required, but users might not be notified. Users need to set the password manually. The policy reports as failed until the user sets a password that meets your requirements.
  >
  >   To apply the device password settings during device enrollment, assign the device restriction profile to users, not devices. During enrollment, users are asked to set a screen lock. Then, they must choose a device password that meets all the requirements in this device restriction profile.
  > - On dedicated devices, if the device is set up with single or multi-app kiosk mode, then users are prompted to set a password. Screens force and guide users to create a compliant password before they can continue using the device.
  > - On dedicated devices that aren't using kiosk mode, users aren't notified of any password requirement. Users need to set the password manually. The policy reports as failed until the user sets a password that meets your requirements.
