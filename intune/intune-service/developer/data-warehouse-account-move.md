# Move your Intune Data Warehouse account data 

[!INCLUDE [azure_portal](../includes/azure_portal.md)]

By requesting an account move, you're requesting that your data center is changed to another location. After the move, your Data Warehouse will reset and begin recording data at the new location based on the specified day your move begins. To back up your previous Data Warehouse data, complete the following steps **prior** to your account move. Most Data Warehouse tables retain data for 30 days, so any data gap in these tables will no longer be available 30 days after your account move. To learn more about the retention periods for specific tables, see [Data Warehouse data model](reports-ref-data-model.md). 

## Back up your Data Warehouse data 

To back up your Data Warehouse data, you must save your Data Warehouse data into a *.csv* file using the  Data Warehouse API:  

1. Follow the one-time process in [Get data from the Intune Data Warehouse API with a REST client](reports-proc-data-rest.md) if you’re using the Data Warehouse API for the first time.
2. Download all your data as CSV files by using the PowerShell sample [Access the Intune Data Warehouse with PowerShell](https://github.com/Microsoft/Intune-Data-Warehouse/tree/master/Samples/PowerShell).

## After a Data Warehouse account move

After the Data Warehouse account move, you'll see in Intune that the Data Warehouse was reset. You need to update your Intune Data Warehouse API URL with the new tenant location for data to refresh. See [API URL structure](reports-api-url.md#api-url-structure).

## Data Warehouse move example 

Customer X requests an account move to begin on January 6, 2018. In response to the request, the customer receives a link to see documentation detailing steps to take if they wish to back up their previous Data Warehouse. On January 6, 2018, the Data Warehouse and the charts it supports will reset and begin storing data in the new data center.
