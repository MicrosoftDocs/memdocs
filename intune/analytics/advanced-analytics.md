# What is Microsoft Intune Advanced Analytics

[!INCLUDE [intune-add-on-note](../intune-service/includes/intune-add-on-note.md)]

Microsoft Intune Advanced Analytics provides comprehensive visibility of the end-user experience in your organization and optimizes it with data driven insights. With Intune Advanced Analytics, your organization can proactively detect and resolve endpoint issues, streamline troubleshooting process, and improve your users' technology experience.

The Microsoft Intune Suite includes features for Advanced Analytics, such as:

- **Custom device scopes** allow you to use [Scope tags](../intune-service/fundamentals/scope-tags.md) to slice Endpoint analytics reports to a subset of devices. You can see scores, insights, and recommendations specific to subsets of your enrolled devices. For example,  you can focus on devices that you manage, devices assigned to a specific business group, or devices located in a particular geographic region. For more information, see [Device scopes](device-scopes.md).

- **Anomalies** monitors the health of devices in your organization for user experience and productivity regressions following configuration changes. For more information, see [Anomaly detection](anomaly-detection.md).

- An **Enhanced device timeline** includes more events and lower data latency to assist with troubleshooting device issues. For more information, see [Enhanced device timeline](enhanced-device-timeline.md).

- **Device query** enables you to get near-real time access to data about the state and configuration of devices. For more information, see [Device query](device-query.md).

- A **Battery health** report to gain visibility into hardware performance issues impacting user technology experience. For more information, see [Battery health](battery-health.md)

Intune Advanced Analytics is automatically integrated into the existing base Endpoint analytics experience in the Intune admin center under **Reports** > **Endpoint analytics**.
