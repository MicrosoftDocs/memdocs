# Device query for multiple devices

Device query for multiple devices allows you to gain comprehensive insights about your entire fleet of devices using Kusto Query Language (KQL) to query across collected inventory data for your devices.

## Prerequisites  

> [!NOTE]
> You don't need to create a properties catalog policy for Android and Apple devices. Device properties are collected automatically. 

- To use Device query in your tenant, you must have a license that includes Microsoft Intune Advanced Analytics. Advanced Analytics features are available with:

  - The Intune Advanced Analytics add-on
  - Microsoft Intune Suite

- For a user to use Device query, you must assign the Managed Devices > Query and Organization > Read permissions to them.

- Devices must be Intune managed and corporate owned.

- Device query for multiple devices only works on devices that are already collecting device inventory data from an assigned [Properties catalog](../intune-service/configuration/properties-catalog.md) profile. 

## Supported platforms

Device query for multiple devices is supported on devices running:  

- Windows 10 and later  
- Android  
  - Android Enterprise corporate owned dedicated devices (COSU)  
  - Android Enterprise corporate owned fully managed (COBO)  
  - Android Enterprise corporate owned work profile (COPE)  
- Apple  
  - iOS/iPadOS  
  - macOS  

## How to use device query for multiple devices

To use device query for multiple devices, go to the **Devices** pane and select **Device query**. Then input a query in the query box using the supported properties and supported operators and select **Run** to execute the query. Results are displayed in the **Results** tab area. If you only want to run part of the query, or if you have multiple queries in the query window and only want to run one, you can highlight the query you want to run and select **Run**. Only that query is run.

You can expand the view on the left side to see all the properties that can be queried. Select any one to populate into your query. You can select and drag the edges of both the left side and the query window to make any adjustments.  

After running a query, select **Export** to save results to a .CSV file. You have the option to export all columns in the query result or just the columns you select. You can export up to 50,000 results to a file. 

> [!TIP]
> You can now use Copilot in Intune (public preview) to generate KQL queries for device query using natural language requests. To learn more, go to [Query with Copilot in device query](../intune-service/copilot/copilot-intune-overview.md#query-multiple-devices).

For more information on Kusto Query Language, see [Learn more about Kusto Query Language](/azure/data-explorer/kusto/query/).

## Sample queries

To help you get started, some sample queries are provided in this section. To access the sample queries, expand the **example queries** section under the Getting started page, and select the one you want to add to the query window. The following section shows the list of sample queries.

#### Top processors by Core Count

This query lists the top five CPUs sorted by core count.

```kusto
Cpu| project Device, ProcessorId, Model, Architecture, CpuStatus, ProcessorType, CoreCount, LogicalProcessorCount, Manufacturer, AddressWidth| order by CoreCount asc| take 5
```

This query lists devices with unencrypted disks.

```kusto
EncryptableVolume| where ProtectionStatus != "PROTECTED"| join LogicalDrive
```

#### Arm64 devices

This query lists all devices with an ARM64 processor.

```kusto
Cpu | where Architecture == "ARM64"
```

#### Device count by processor architecture

This query provides a summary of devices by CPU architecture.

```

#### Devices memory information

This query lists devices with physical and virtual memory in GB.

```kusto
MemoryInfo| project Device, PhysicalMemoryGB = PhysicalMemoryTotalBytes/(1000*1000*1000), VirtualMemoryGB = VirtualMemoryTotalBytes/(1000*1000*1000) | order by PhysicalMemoryGB asc  
```

#### Device count by OS version

This query provides a summary of devices by OS version.

```kusto

This query lists devices based on BIOS manufacturer.

```kusto
BiosInfo| where Manufacturer contains "Microsoft"
```

#### TPM disabled devices

This query lists devices that have TPM disabled.

```kusto
Tpm | where Enabled != true
```

## Supported operators

Device query supports only a subset of the operators supported in the Kusto Query Language (KQL). The following operators are currently supported:

### Table operators

Table operators can be used to filter, summarize, and transform data streams. The following operators are supported:

| **Table Operators** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| count | Returns a table with a single record containing the number of records. |
| distinct | Produces a table with the distinct combination of the provided columns of the input table. |
| join | Merge the rows of two tables to form a new table by matching row for the same device. Only the join types of `innerunique`, `Leftouter`, `Fullouter`, `Rightouter`, and inner are supported. If you type in a join type other than the ones supported, they're ignored. Join statements support `on` syntax if joined with `Device` or `Device.Deviceid`. Common syntax for join is LeftEntity \| join [hints] (RightEntity) on Conditions. For more info, see [Join](/kusto/query/join-operator) documentation.|
| order by | Sort the rows of the input table into order by one or more columns. |
| project | Select the columns to include, rename or drop, and insert new computed columns. |
| take | Return up to the specified number of rows. |
| top | Returns the first N records sorted by the specified columns. |
| where | Filter a table to the subset of rows that satisfy a predicate. |
| Summarize | produces a table that aggregates the contents of the input table. |

### Scalar operators

Scalar operators can be used to perform operations on individual values. The following operators are supported:

| **Operators** | **Description** | **Example** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| == | Equal | 1 == 1, 'aBc' == 'AbC' |
| != | Not Equal | 1 != 2, 'abc' != 'abcd' |
| < | Less | 1 < 2, 'abc' < 'DEF' |
| > | Greater | 2 > 1, 'xyz' > 'XYZ' |
| <= | Less or Equal | 1 <= 2, 'abc' <= 'abc' |
| >= | Greater or Equal | 2 >= 1, 'abc' >= 'ABC' |
| + | Add | 2 + 1, now() + 1d |
| - | Subtract | 2 - 1, now() - 1h |
| * | Multiply | 2 * 2 |
| / | Divide | 2 / 1 |
| % | Modulo | 2 % 1 |
| like | LHS contains a match for RHS | 'abc' like '%B%' |
| contains | RHS occurs as a subsequence of LHS | 'abc' contains 'b' |
| !contains | RHS doesn't occur in LHS | 'team' !contains 'i' |
| startswith | RHS is an initial subsequence of LHS | 'team' startswith 'tea' |
| !startswith | RHS isn't an initial subsequence of LHS | 'abc' !startswith 'bc' |
| endswith | RHS is a closing subsequence of LHS | 'abc' endswith 'bc' |
| !endswith | RHS isn't a closing subsequence of LHS | 'abc' !endswith 'a' |
| and | True if and only if RHS and LHS are true | (1 == 1) and (2 == 2) |
| or | True if and only if RHS or LHS is true | (1 == 1) or (1 == 2) |

### Aggregation functions

Aggregation functions can be used to summarize data. The following functions are supported:

| **Function** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| avg() | Returns the average of the values across the group |
| count() | Returns a count of the records per summarization group |
| countif() | Returns a count of rows for which Predicate evaluates to true |
| dcount() | Returns the number of distinct values in the group |
| max() | Returns the maximum value across the group |
| maxif() | Returns the maximum value across the group for which Predicate evaluates to true |
| min() | Returns the minimum value across the group |
| minif() | Returns the minimum value across the group for which Predicate evaluates to true |
| percentile() | Returns an estimate for the specified nearest-rank percentile of the population defined by Expr |
| sum() | Returns the sum of the values across the group |
| sumif() | Returns a sum of Expr for which Predicate evaluates to true |

### Scalar functions

Scalar functions can be used to perform operations on individual values. The following functions are supported:

| **Function** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| ago() | Subtracts the given timespan from the current UTC clock time. |
| bin() | Rounds values down to a number of datetime multiple of a given bin size. |
| case() | Evaluates a list of predicates and returns the first result expression whose predicate is satisfied. |
| datetime_add() | Calculates a new datetime from a specified datepart multiplied by a specified amount, added to a specified datetime. Negative values for the amount parameter aren't supported. |
| datetime_diff() | Calculates the difference between two datetime values. |
| iif() | Evaluates the first argument and returns the value of either the second or third arguments depending on whether the predicate evaluated to true (second) or false (third). |
| indexof() | Reports the zero-based index of the first occurrence of a specified string within the input string. |
| isnotnull() | Evaluates its sole argument and returns a Boolean value indicating if the argument evaluates to a non-null value. |
| isnull() | Evaluates its sole argument and returns a Boolean value indicating if the argument evaluates to a null value. |
| now() | Returns the current UTC clock time. |
| strcat() | Concatenates between 1 and 64 arguments. |
| strlen() | Returns the length, in characters, of the input string. |
| substring() | Extracts a substring from a source string starting from some index to the end of the string. |

### Device entity

Device query for multiple devices supports a linked entity which can be used with all other supported entities. The device entity supports the following properties:

| **Property** | **Type** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| DeviceId | String | A unique ID generated by Intune as part of MDM enrollment. |
| EntraDeviceId | String | Unique ID generated by Microsoft Entra as part of Microsoft Entra registration or join. |
| ManagementName | String | An easily recognizable device name used only in the Intune admin center. Changing this name doesn't change the device name or the name in the Company Portal. |
| DeviceName | String | Name of the device |
| SerialNumber | String | Serial number of the device |
| Manufacturer | String | Manufacturer of the device |
| Model | String | Model of the device |
| OSDescription | String | Full description of the operating system edition |
| OSVersion | String | The version of the operating system on the device |
| EnrollmentProfileName | String | Name of the enrollment profile assigned to the device. Default value is an empty string indicating no enrollment profile was assigned to the device. |
| EnrolledDateTime | Datetime | The date and time that the device was enrolled in Intune. |
| CertExpirationDateTime | Datetime | Reports device management certificate expiration date. |
| EnrolledByUserId | String | Unique identifier for the user that enrolled the device |
| PrimaryUserId | String | Unique identifier for the user associated with the device. |
| LastLoggedOnUserId | String | Unique identifier for the user who last logged on to the device. |
| InCompliancePeriodUntilDateTime | Datetime | The DateTime when device compliance grace period expires |
| DeviceCategoryId | String | Device category display name. Default is an empty string. |
| LastSeenDateTime | String | The date and time that the device last connected to Intune. |
| Ownership | String | Ownership of the device. |

Device entity allows you to reference the device associated with a resulting row without needing to write a separate query to join them together. Essentially, it acts as an automatic join to include device information in your query results.

The device entity is automatically joined to every other entity for ease of use. The device entity shows up in query results as the first column in query results by default, unless the query updates the return type (through use of operators like a project, summarize, or distinct).
Using Device by itself in a query parses to Device.DeviceId. In the Device column returned by default, the DeviceId is translated to DeviceName to allow for easier identification of devices.
The device entity and its properties can also be referenced in queries by referencing Device.[Insert property].

The following query returns all the DiskDrive information for all devices with serial number 123.:

```kusto
DiskDrive 
where Device.SerialNumber = 123
```

The following query projects the Device ID and Manufacturer properties of the entity DiskDrive:  

```kusto
DiskDrive | project Device.DeviceId, Manufacturer
```

Although the Device entity that is shown as the first column by default appears as device names using Device by itself in a query parses to Device.DeviceId.  
This query returns results ordered by the DeviceID, not by DeviceName:

```kusto
MemoryInfo | order by Device
```

Similarly, this query returns no results unless the device ID is Desktop123. It doesn't query on device name:

```kusto
Cpu | where Device == “Desktop123”
```

Use the following example to query on device name:  

```kusto
Cpu | where Device.DeviceName == ‘Desktop123”
```

## Known limitations

- Using the Device entity in aggregation functions shows a red underline. However, the query can  still run and can return results as expected. For example, the following query shows a red underline under **Device** but still runs:

    ```kusto
    Cpu | summarize max(Device) by Manufacturer.
    ```

- Queries with a join operator, $left and $right parameters show a red underline under $left and $right. However, the query can still run and returns results as expected.  

- A single query can contain a maximum of three join operators. Queries with more joins fail.

- A max of ~50,000 records are returned for a query.  

- A maximum of 10 queries can be submitted per minute. Additional queries will fail.

- A maximum of 1,000 queries can be submitted per month.

- Negative values for the amounts parameter of the datetime_add() function aren't supported.  

- Referencing a variable that has been summarized by an aggregation function throws an error. Explicitly naming the variable allows the query to succeed again. For example, the query Device | summarize dcount(DeviceId) | order by dcount_DeviceId will fail. Device | summarize DCountDeviceIdRename=dcount(DeviceId) | order by DCountDeviceIdRename succeeds.
