# Endpoint analytics overview

Endpoint analytics helps IT professionals assess and improve the user experience across managed devices. It provides data-driven insights into device performance, startup times, app reliability, and battery healthâ€”empowering IT teams to proactively identify and remediate issues that impact productivity.

Endpoint analytics contributes to the technology experiences category within [Microsoft Adoption Score](/microsoft-365/admin/productivity/productivity-score), offering device-level insights that complement broader organizational productivity metrics.

The service integrates with Microsoft Intune, enabling IT pros to:

- Enroll devices directly from Intune.
- Use Configuration Manager for co-managed environments.
- Manage data collection and configuration.
- View analytics in the Intune admin center.
- Apply remediations or adjust policies based on insights.

To enroll Intune-managed devices to endpoint analytics, they need to send required functional data to Microsoft public cloud. Ensure the following endpoints are accessible from Intune-managed devices:

| Endpoint  | Function  |
|-----------|-----------|
| `https://*.events.data.microsoft.com` | Used by managed devices to send [required functional data](data-collection.md#data-collection) to the Intune data collection endpoint. |

::: zone-end

Configuration Manager-managed devices send data to Intune via the connector on the Configuration Manager role and they don't need directly access to the Microsoft public cloud. If your environment uses a proxy server, configure the proxy server to allow the following endpoints:

| Endpoint  | Function  |
|-----------|-----------|
| `https://graph.windows.net` | Used to automatically retrieve settings  when attaching your hierarchy to endpoint analytics on Configuration Manager Server role. For more information, see [Configure the proxy for a site system server](../configmgr/core/plan-design/network/proxy-server-support.md#configure-the-proxy-for-a-site-system-server). |
| `https://*.manage.microsoft.com` | Used to synch device collection and devices with endpoint analytics on Configuration Manager Server role only. For more information, see [Configure the proxy for a site system server](../configmgr/core/plan-design/network/proxy-server-support.md#configure-the-proxy-for-a-site-system-server). |

If you have co-management enabled, enrolled devices send required functional data directly to Microsoft public cloud. In this case, ensure the following endpoints are accessible from co-managed devices:

| Endpoint  | Function  |
|-----------|-----------|
| `https://*.events.data.microsoft.com` | Used by managed devices to send [required functional data](data-collection.md#data-collection) to the Intune data collection endpoint. |

### Licensing requirements

::: zone pivot="intune"

- Devices enrolled in endpoint analytics need a valid license for the use of Microsoft Intune. For more information, see [Microsoft Intune licensing](../intune-service/fundamentals/licenses.md).

::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="cm"

- Devices enrolled in endpoint analytics need a valid license for the use of Microsoft Intune. For more information, see [Microsoft Configuration Manager licensing](../configmgr/core/understand/learn-more-editions.md).

::: zone-end

[!INCLUDE [rbac-requirements](../includes/h3/rbac-requirements.md)]

Endpoint analytics includes tasks that require different levels of permissions.

For a detailed breakdown of the required permissions for each task:

- [RBAC requirements for configuring endpoint analytics](configure.md#-role-and-permission-requirements)
- [RBAC requirements for rewieving endpoint analytics data](scores.md#-role-and-permission-requirements)

::: zone pivot="cm"

## Configuration Manager requirements

To use endpoint analytics, your environment must have [tenant attach](../configmgr/tenant-attach/device-sync-actions.md) enabled. Tenant attach connects Configuration Manager to Intune, allowing you to manage devices from the Intune admin center and perform actions such as device sync and remote tasks.

> [!NOTE]
> Using multiple Configuration Manager hierarchies with a single endpoint analytics instance isn't supported.

## Reports available in endpoint analytics

Endpoint analytics organizes insights into reports that highlight performance and reliability issues across managed devices. Common examples include:

- Startup performance: Identifies devices with slow boot times and contributing factors.
- Application reliability: Tracks app crashes and stability trends.
- Restart frequency: Highlights devices that restart often, signaling potential hardware or software issues.
