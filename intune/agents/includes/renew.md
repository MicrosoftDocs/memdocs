## Renew the agent

If you don't use an agent for 90 days, the agent authorization expires. If the agent authentication expires, subsequent agent runs fail until reauthentication. You can renew the agent authentication before or after expiration.

As the expiration gets closer, Intune shows a warning that each **Copilot owner** and **Copilot contributor** can see on the agent overview page. The warning states that the authorized period is ending, and prompts to renew the agent identity.

To reauthorize the agent identity, select **Renew authentication**. When you renew the agent authentication, the agent automatically uses the signed-in credentials. If you don't want to use the signed-in credentials, then select the agent > **Settings** tab > **Choose another identity**.

After renewal, the warning banner disappears, and a toast notification validates that renewal is successful.
