# Use the Vulnerability Remediation Agent

The [Vulnerability Remediation Agent](vulnerability-remediation-agent.md) uses AI-powered analysis to identify and prioritize vulnerabilities across your managed devices, providing step-by-step remediation guidance through the Intune admin center.

After you [set up the agent](vulnerability-remediation-agent.md), you can run vulnerability assessments, review prioritized suggestions, and track your remediation progress over time.

This article shows you how to use the Vulnerability Remediation Agent, including:

- Running vulnerability assessments
- Reviewing and managing suggestions
- Understanding remediation guidance
- Tracking applied remediations

To learn about the agent and how to set it up, see [Vulnerability Remediation Agent in Microsoft Intune](vulnerability-remediation-agent.md).

This feature applies to:

- Windows
- Apps in Intune

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you meet the requirements detailed in the [Vulnerability Remediation Agent](vulnerability-remediation-agent.md#prerequisites) article, including signing in with an appropriate account.

## Explore the agent

To explore and use the agent, open the [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431), select **Endpoint security** > **Vulnerability Remediation Agent (preview)**.

The following tabs are available:

# [Overview](#tab/overview)

After the Vulnerability Remediation Agent completes a run, the **Overview** tab updates with the agent's prioritized list of top vulnerabilities. 

The following information is available on this tab:

- The agent's availability and run status
- Agent suggestions, which are the prioritized list of vulnerabilities
- The list of past agent activity

:::image type="content" source="./images/vulnerability-remediation-agent/agent-home-screen.png" alt-text="A screenshot that displays the Remediation Agent home page in the admin center.":::

# [Settings](#tab/settings)

On the Vulnerability Remediation Agent **Settings** tab, you can view the existing details about the current configuration of the agent. You can also view details about the agent's identity, and choose to [assign a different identity](vulnerability-remediation-agent.md#change-the-agent-identity) to run the agent.

---

## Run the agent

To manually run the Vulnerability Remediation Agent:

1. In the [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431), go to **Endpoint security** > **Vulnerability Remediation Agent (preview)**.

2. On the **Overview** tab, select **Start agent**. This option isn't available until after the agent is set up and completes its first run.

When an agent run starts, the agent runs until it completes its evaluation. It can't be stopped or paused.

Each time the agent runs, it runs under the [agent identity](vulnerability-remediation-agent.md#agent-identity) and permissions of the Intune administrator that it's been configured to use.

## View and manage vulnerability suggestions

After the agent completes a run, you can review and manage the vulnerability suggestions in the Intune admin center. Agent suggestions are a prioritized list of the top vulnerabilities identified based on data from [Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management](/defender-vulnerability-management/defender-vulnerability-management).

### Understanding agent suggestions

Agent suggestions display the following information:

- **Suggested next steps:** Each *suggested next step* is a link that opens a *Suggested action* pane with detailed remediation guidance.

- **Impact:** The potential impact based on the [exposure score](/defender-vulnerability-management/tvm-exposure-score) as identified by Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management.

- **Exposed devices:** The count of affected devices. CVE counts shown by the agent are only for devices with Windows client operating system editions and don't include server editions.

- **Status:** By default, a reported vulnerability has its status set to *Not applied*. You can mark suggestions as applied after implementing remediation.

- **Last applied:** The date and time when you marked the remediation guidance as applied.

:::image type="content" source="./images/vulnerability-remediation-agent/suggested-action-pane.png" alt-text="A screenshot that displays the Suggested actions for an App vulnerability.":::

### Working with suggested actions

When you select a suggested next step, the *Suggested action* pane provides detailed information including:

- Details about the associated vulnerabilities (for Intune managed devices)
- Suggested actions to take to remediate the threat
- A *Configurations* section with available settings from the Intune settings catalog
- An option to mark the remediation as *Applied*

#### Remediation guidance categories

Remediation guidance falls into the following categories:

**Apps**: To remediate app vulnerabilities, the agent might recommend:
- Deployment of an updated app version
- Deployment of an Intune profile to manage app behavior and reduce security risks

**Windows**: To remediate Windows vulnerabilities, common recommendations include:
- Deployment of a quality update policy
- Expedited deployment of quality updates using Windows update rings

When a recommendation involves a Windows update, the agent guidance includes details about using [update rings](../intune-service/protect/windows-10-update-rings.md) to help manage a controlled rollout of the update.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Some suggested Windows update recommendations begin with **Expedite**. The agent uses this format when the CVE's Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) score reaches a risk value of **9.0** or greater. For this level of risk, the agent recommends expediting these updates to your devices immediately. The guidance includes how to use [Expedited installation of quality updates](../intune-service/protect/windows-10-expedite-updates.md) to more rapidly deploy the recommended update.

#### Configuration recommendations

In the **Configurations** section, the agent provides details for creating a device configuration policy using available settings from the [settings catalog](../intune-service/configuration/settings-catalog.md). This guidance helps you reduce your attack surface against vulnerabilities and includes:

- A list of relevant settings you can configure through an Intune settings catalog policy
- Each setting is presented with the recommended configuration
- Selecting the citation icon next to a setting displays the setting's description and may include links to the underlying Configuration Service Provider (CSP) documentation

If there are no recommended device configuration settings to deploy, the Configurations section indicates that no recommended settings catalog policy configurations are available.

### Track applied remediations

After you review agent suggestions and apply recommended remediations, you can self-attest to applying those remediations by selecting **Mark as applied**. This action:

- Confirms that the remediation steps are complete
- Doesn't trigger any device changes by the agent
- Adds a timestamp called *Last marked as applied* to track when the remediation was implemented

With subsequent runs of the agent, suggestions might be updated. If a previous suggestion was marked as applied, you can self-attest to applying the more recent suggestions by selecting **Mark update as applied**. This updates the *Last marked as applied* timestamp to the current time.

While optional, marking a suggested action as applied helps track when suggested remediations were implemented. Recommendations marked as applied persist in the agent suggestions list, serving as a baseline for future runs and allowing you to compare new results and changes for the same vulnerability over time.

## View agent activity

The **Activity** section tracks the current and past run activity of the agent:

- When the agent is actively running, the Status column displays *Run in progress*
- The status column displays *Complete* for past agent runs

This section provides visibility into:
- When the agent last ran
- How long each run took to complete
- Success or failure status of each run

## Vulnerability Remediation Agent logs

During the public preview, there are limited logs available for the agent.

All agent management actions (create, delete, run) and any permission failures are available in [Security Copilot logs](/copilot/security/audit-log). Logging of discovered vulnerabilities or when remediations were applied aren't available. Instead, use the options to mark remediated vulnerabilities as *Applied*.
