# Use the Vulnerability Remediation Agent

The [Vulnerability Remediation Agent](vulnerability-remediation-agent.md) uses AI-powered analysis to identify and prioritize vulnerabilities across your managed devices, providing step-by-step remediation guidance through the Intune admin center.

After you [set up the agent](vulnerability-remediation-agent.md), you can run vulnerability assessments, review prioritized suggestions, and track your remediation progress over time.

> [!TIP]
>
> The Vulnerability Remediation Agent is accessible in the Intune admin center from both the **Agents** and **Endpoint security** nodes. Each path provides access to the same agent. In this documentation, references to its location use the *Agents* node.

This article shows you how to use the Vulnerability Remediation Agent, including:

- Running vulnerability assessments
- Reviewing and managing suggestions
- Understanding remediation guidance
- Tracking applied remediations

To learn about the agent and how to set it up, see [Vulnerability Remediation Agent in Microsoft Intune](vulnerability-remediation-agent.md).

## Prerequisites

Before you start, review the requirements in the [Vulnerability Remediation Agent](vulnerability-remediation-agent.md#prerequisites) article.

## Explore the Vulnerability Remediation Agent

After configuration, manage the agent from the Vulnerability Remediation Agent pane.

In the [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431), select **Agents** > **Vulnerability Remediation Agent (preview)**. Select the following tabs to learn more:

- **Overview** - View the agent's current status, the top prioritized vulnerabilities that the agent has identified, and records of recent agent activity.
- **Suggestions** - Here you'll find the full list of vulnerabilities that the agent has identified.
- **Settings** - This tab displays the agent's configuration details.

# [Overview](#tab/overview)

The Overview tab includes:

- **Agent status** - Various tiles introduce the agent, detail whether the agent is available and its current run status.
- **Agent suggestions** – This is a short list of the top vulnerabilities that should be addressed.
- **Activity** – This area tracks the current and past run activity of the agent. When the agent is still actively running, the Status column displays Run in progress. The status column displays Complete for past agent runs.

After the agent completes a run, the Overview tab updates with the top vulnerabilities that should be reviewed and addressed. This tab shows only a few suggestions at a time; the full list is available on the Suggestions tab. Use either tab to drill down and review or manage recommendations.

# [Suggestions](#tab/suggestions)

The *Suggestions* tab shows the full list of reviewed vulnerabilities in a prioritized list. Suggestions are generated after each agent run and reflect the latest data. Use search and filters to find specific suggestions.

Each suggestion includes columns with these details:

- **Remediation type** - Identifies what the remediation applies to, like an app, or the operating system (OS).
- **Impact** - This value is the potential impact the [exposure score](/defender-vulnerability-management/tvm-exposure-score) as identified by Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management.
- **Exposed devices** - The count of affected devices. The associated CVEs number count shown by the agent is only for devices with Windows client operating system editions and doesn't include server editions. The devices listed in the .csv export omit any devices not found in Microsoft Entra.
- **Status** - By default, a reported vulnerability has its status set to *Not applied*. An admin can drill into a reported vulnerability to review and deploy the suggested remediation, and then select the option to mark that suggestion as applied, which changes the status of the agent's suggestion to *Applied*. *Mark as applied* confirms that an admin attests to having completed the remediation steps. No action is taken on devices by the agent.
- **Last applied** - The user account that submitted the request.

# [Settings](#tab/settings)

On the Vulnerability Remediation Agent **Settings** tab, you can view the existing details about the current configuration of the agent. You can also view details about the agent's identity, and choose to [assign a different identity](vulnerability-remediation-agent.md#change-the-agent-identity) to run the agent.

---

## Run the Vulnerability Remediation Agent

Run the agent to evaluate new data from Defender and refresh Agent suggestions for discovered vulnerabilities. The agent runs until evaluation completes; you can't stop or pause it.

The agent uses the identity and permissions of the assigned Intune admin account. Its operations are limited to the permissions of that account. If the agent doesn't run for 90 consecutive days, its authentication expires and subsequent runs fail until the identity is renewed.

The agent doesn't support scheduled runs and must be started manually each time you want to update its results.

**To manually run the Vulnerability Remediation Agent:**

1. In the [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431), go to **Agents** > **Vulnerability Remediation Agent (preview)**.

2. On the **Overview** tab, select **Start agent**. This option isn't available until after the agent is set up and completes its first run.


## Manage agent suggestions

Use the Vulnerability Remediation Agent node to review and manage the vulnerability suggestions in the Intune admin center. Agent suggestions are a prioritized list of the top vulnerabilities identified based on data from [Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management](/defender-vulnerability-management/defender-vulnerability-management).

You can select Agent suggestions from both the *Overview* and *Suggestions* tabs.

### Understanding agent suggestions

Agent suggestions display the following information:

- **Suggested next steps:** Each *suggested next step* is a link that opens a *Suggested action* pane with detailed remediation guidance.

- **Impact:** The potential impact based on the [exposure score](/defender-vulnerability-management/tvm-exposure-score) as identified by Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management.

- **Exposed devices:** The count of affected devices. CVE counts shown by the agent are only for devices with Windows client operating system editions and don't include server editions.

- **Status:** By default, a reported vulnerability has its status set to *Not applied*. You can mark suggestions as applied after implementing remediation.

- **Last applied:** The date and time when you marked the remediation guidance as applied.

:::image type="content" source="./images/vulnerability-remediation-agent/suggested-action-pane.png" alt-text="A screenshot that displays the Suggested actions for an App vulnerability.":::

### Working with suggested actions

When you select a suggested next step, the *Suggested action* pane provides detailed information including:

- Details about the associated vulnerabilities (for Intune managed devices)
- Suggested actions to take to remediate the threat
- A *Configurations* section with available settings from the Intune settings catalog
- An option to mark the remediation as *Applied*

#### Remediation guidance categories

Remediation guidance falls into the following categories:

**Apps**: To remediate app vulnerabilities, the agent might recommend:

- Deployment of an updated app version
- Deployment of an Intune profile to manage app behavior and reduce security risks

**Operating system**: To remediate operating system (OS) vulnerabilities, like those for Windows, common recommendations include:

- Deployment of a quality update policy
- Expedited deployment of quality updates using Windows update rings

When a recommendation involves a Windows update, the agent guidance includes details about using [update rings](../intune-service/protect/windows-10-update-rings.md) to help manage a controlled rollout of the update.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Some suggested Windows update recommendations begin with **Expedite**. The agent uses this format when the CVE's Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) score reaches a risk value of **9.0** or greater. For this level of risk, the agent recommends expediting these updates to your devices immediately. The guidance includes how to use [Expedited installation of quality updates](../intune-service/protect/expedite-updates.md) to more rapidly deploy the recommended update.

#### Configuration recommendations

> [!NOTE]
>  
> There is an active but temporary issue affecting the Vulnerability Remediation agent. Until it’s resolved, the agent is unable to provide recommended __Configurations__ for settings to use for this threat. The agent still identifies threats, explains their background, and offers step-by-step actions.
>
> Configuration recommendations will resume automatically once the issue is resolved.


In the **Configurations** section, the agent provides details for creating a device configuration policy using available settings from the [settings catalog](../intune-service/configuration/settings-catalog.md). This guidance helps you reduce your attack surface against vulnerabilities and includes:

- A list of relevant settings you can configure through an Intune settings catalog policy
- Each setting is presented with the recommended configuration
- Selecting the citation icon next to a setting displays that setting's description and might include links to the underlying Configuration Service Provider (CSP) documentation

If there are no recommended device configuration settings to deploy, the Configurations section indicates that no recommended settings catalog policy configurations are available.

### Track applied remediations

After you review agent suggestions and apply recommended remediations, you can self-attest to applying those remediations by selecting **Mark as applied**. This action:

- Confirms that the remediation steps are complete
- Doesn't trigger any device changes by the agent
- Adds a timestamp called *Last marked as applied* to track when the remediation was implemented

With subsequent runs of the agent, suggestions might be updated. If a previous suggestion was marked as applied, you can self-attest to applying the more recent suggestions by selecting **Mark update as applied**. This updates the *Last marked as applied* timestamp to the current time.

While optional, marking a suggested action as applied helps track when suggested remediations were implemented. Recommendations marked as applied persist in the agent suggestions list, serving as a baseline for future runs and allowing you to compare new results and changes for the same vulnerability over time.

## View agent activity

The **Activity** section tracks the current and past run activity of the agent:

- When the agent is actively running, the Status column displays *Run in progress*
- The status column displays *Complete* for past agent runs

This section provides visibility into:

- When the agent last ran
- How long each run took to complete
- Success or failure status of each run

## Agent logs

All agent management actions (create, delete, run) and any permission failures are available in [Security Copilot logs](/copilot/security/audit-log). Logging of discovered vulnerabilities or when remediations were applied aren't available. Instead, use the options to mark remediated vulnerabilities as *Applied*.
