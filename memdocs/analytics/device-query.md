# Device query

Device query allows you to quickly gain on-demand information about the state of your devices. When you enter a query on a selected device, Device query runs a query in real time. The data returned can then be used to respond to security threats, troubleshoot the device, or make business decisions.

## Prerequisites

- To use Device query in your tenant, you must have a license that includes Microsoft Intune Advanced Analytics. Advanced Analytics features are available with:

  - The Intune Advanced Analytics Add-on
  - Microsoft Intune Suite

- To use Device query on a device, the device must be enrolled in Endpoint Analytics. Learn [how to enroll a device in Endpoint Analytics](enroll-intune.md).

- You cannot opt out of cloud notifications (WNS)

- For a user to use Device query, you must assign the **Managed Devices** - **Query** permission to them.  

- To use Device query, devices must be Intune managed and corporate owned.

- To run remote actions, at a minimum, sign into the [Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431) with an account that has the **Help Desk Operator** role. For more information on the different roles, go to [Role-based access control (RBAC) with Microsoft Intune](../intune/fundamentals/role-based-access-control.md).

- To receive the remote action, the device must be connected to the internet and powered on.

## Supported platforms

Device query is currently only supported on devices running Windows 10 and later.

## How to use Device query

To use Device query, navigate to **Devices** and select the device on which you want to use Device query. Select **Device Query** under the **Monitor** section.

The supported properties you can query are listed in the **Properties** section. To run a query, enter a Kusto Query Language (KQL) query, and select **Run**. Results are displayed in the **Results** tab area.

For more information on Kusto Query Language, see [Learn more about Kusto Query Language](/azure/data-explorer/kusto/query/).

> [!TIP]
> You can now use Copilot in Intune (public preview) to generate KQL queries for device query using natural language requests. To learn more, go to [Query with Copilot in device query](../intune/copilot/copilot-intune-overview.md#query-with-copilot-in-device-query).

## Remote device actions

Use the Intune remote device actions in Single device query to help you manage your devices remotely. From the device query interface, you can now run device actions based on query results for faster and more efficient troubleshooting.

### Available remote actions

The available device actions depend on the device configuration. Not all actions are available for all devices.

For a complete list of what can be done on your devices, in the Intune admin center, select Devices > All devices, and select a specific device. The available device actions are shown at the top. 

The following list includes supported device actions:

## Supported Operatorsâ€¯ 

Device query supports only a subset of the operators supported in the Kusto Query Language (KQL). The following operators are currently supported:

[Table operators](#table-operators)

[Scalar operators](#scalar-operators)

[Aggregation functions](#aggregation-functions)

[Scalar functions](#scalar-functions)

### Table operators

Table operators can be used filter, summarize, and transform data streams. Currently the following operators are supported:

|Table operators|Description|
|---|---|
|count|Returns a table with a single record containing the number of records|
|distinct|Produces a table with the distinct combination of the provided columns of the input table|
|join|Merge the rows of two tables to form a new table by matching row for the same device|
|order by|Sort the rows of the input table into order by one or more columns|
|project|Select the columns to include, rename or drop, and insert new computed columns|
|take|Return up to the specified number of rows|
|top|Returns the first N records sorted by the specified columns|
|where|Filters a table to the subset of rows that satisfy a predicate|

### Scalar operators

The following table summarizes operators:

|Operators|Description|Example
|---|---|---|
|==|Equal|`1 == 1, 'aBc' == 'AbC'`|
|!=|Not Equal|`1 != 2, 'abc' != 'abcd'`|
|< |Less|`1 < 2, 'abc' < 'DEF'`|
|> |Greater|`2 > 1, 'xyz' > 'XYZ'`|
|<=|Less or Equal|`1 <= 2, 'abc' <= 'abc'`|

|contains|RHS occurs as a subsequence of LHS|`'abc' contains 'b'`|
|!contains|RHS doesn't occur in LHS|`'team' !contains 'i'`|
|startswith|RHS is an initial subsequence of LHS|`'team' startswith 'tea'`|
|!startswith|RHS isn't an initial subsequence of LHS|`'abc' !startswith 'bc'`|
|endswith|RHS is a closing subsequence of LHS|`'abc' endswith 'bc'`|
|!endswith|RHS isn't a closing subsequence of LHS|`'abc' !endswith 'a'`|
|and|True if and only if RHS and LHS are true|`(1 == 1) and (2 == 2)`|
|or|True if and only if RHS or LHS is true|`(1 == 1) or (1 == 2)`|

### Aggregation functions

Aggregation functions can be used with the summarize table operator to calculate summarized values. Currently the following aggregation functions are supported:

|Function|Description|
|---|---|
|avg()|Returns the average of the values across the group|

|ago()|Subtracts the given timespan from the current UTC clock time|
|bin()|Rounds values down to many datetime multiple of a given bin size|
|case()|Evaluates a list of predicates and returns the first result expression whose predicate is satisfied|
|datetime_add()|Calculates a new datetime from a specified datepart multiplied by a specified amount, added to a specified datetime|
|datetime_diff()|Calculates the difference between two date time values|
|iif()|Evaluates the first argument and returns the value of either the second or third arguments depending on whether the predicate evaluated to true (second) or false (third)|
|indexof()|Function reports the zero-based index of the first occurrence of a specified string within input string|
|isnotnull()|Evaluates its sole argument and returns a Boolean value indicating if the argument evaluates to a non-null value|
|isnull()|Evaluates its sole argument and returns a Boolean value indicating if the argument evaluates to a null value|
|now()|Returns the current UTC clock time|
|strcat()|Concatenates between 1 and 64 arguments|
|strlen()|Returns the length, in characters, of the input string|
|substring()|Extracts a substring from a source string starting from some index to the end of the string|

## Known limitations

- The result string of any query is limited to 128kb characters. If the result of your query is longer than 128kb characters, the result is truncated. An error message informs you about how many rows are truncated.  

- You can only send 15 queries a minute. If you run into a **query limit exceeded** error, wait for a minute and try again.  

- Query inputs have a length limit of 2048 characters. If you encounter a *query too long* error, then refine your query to have fewer characters and try again.

- The now() scalar function doesn't support the offset parameter.

- The !like operator is not supported. 

- The input window auto-recommends double quotes when only single quotes are supported on the following operators:
  - contains
  - !contains
  - startswith
  - !startswith
  - endswith

- The WindowsRegistry entity fails to return the RegistryKey for root.

- The WindowsRegistry entity fails to return 64-bit shared registry keys.

- The WindowsRegistry entity fails to return binary ValueData.  

- If youâ€™re querying devices that are running on Windows 10, they must be on a minimum quality version.

  - If running Windows 10 21H2, ensure that it's running version 10.0.19044.3393.  

  - If running Windows 10 22H2, ensure that it's running version 10.0.19045.3393.

- If there are multiple network cards available on the machine, then only the first configured domain is returned.

- If TPM 2.0 is present on the device, then activated and enabled is always returned as TRUE.

- If a file is currently in use on the machine, then FileInfo queries returns an error.

- If the end user has admin access to the device, they might be able to change client-based information that show up in the query results. For example, OS version and registry.
