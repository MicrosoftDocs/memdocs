## Help and support

To request help for Endpoint analytics, use the **Help and Support** option in the portal under **Troubleshooting + support**. This action files an online support ticket for Endpoint analytics. To create and manage a support incident, your account must have a Microsoft Entra role that includes the action **microsoft.office365.supportTickets/tickets/manage**. For more information, see [administrator roles in Microsoft Entra ID](/azure/active-directory/users-groups-roles/directory-assign-admin-roles).

If the issue is more broadly for Intune than just Endpoint analytics, follow the instructions in the [How to get support in Microsoft Intune](../get-support.md) article to open a new support request. For an issue that is more broadly for Configuration Manager than just Endpoint analytics, go to [Microsoft support](https://aka.ms/cmcbsupport) to open a new support request.
