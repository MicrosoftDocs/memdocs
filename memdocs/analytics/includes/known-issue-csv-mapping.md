### Exported csv files display numerical values

When reporting data is exported to a `.csv` file, the exported data doesn't use the friendly names you're used to seeing in the online reports. Use the information below to map the data in the exported file into the meaning of the value:

**Application reliability report** </br>

- The `TotalAppUsageDuration` and `MeanTimeToFailure` columns in the `.csv` file are integer values with a unit of **minutes**
- A `MeanTimeToFailure` value of 2147483647 means `No crash events`

**Per device score report** </br>

- A value of `-1` or `-2` in the `EndpointAnalyticsScore`, `StartupPerformanceScore`, and `AppReliabilityScore` columns means the associated score is unavailable
- Health status: </br>

   |HealthStatus `.csv` value| Report value|
   |---|---|
   |0|Unknown|
   |1|Insufficient data|
   |2|Needs attention|
   |3|Meeting goals|

**Startup performance report** </br> 

The `CoreBootTime`, `GPBootTime`, `CoreLogonTime`, `GPLogonTime`, `DesktopUsableTime`, `Median`, and `TimePerProcess` columns are integer values with a unit of **seconds**.

**Work from anywhere report** </br>

- Column name in `.csv` file: UpgradeEligibility </br>
Report column name: Windows 11 readiness status </br>

   |`.csv` value| Report value|
   |---|---|
   |0|Upgraded|
   |1|Unknown|
   |2|Not capable|
   |3|Capable|

- Column name in `.csv` file: GraphDeviceIsManaged </br> Report column name: Microsoft Entra registered
