- The following permissions are used for Endpoint analytics:
  - Permissions appropriate to the user's role under the **Endpoint Analytics**,  **Organization** or **School Administrator** categories.
A read-only user would only need the **Read** permission under either category. An Intune administrator would typically need all permissions.

  - **Read** under the **Help Desk Operator**, or **Endpoint Security Manager** [Intune roles](../../intune/fundamentals/role-based-access-control.md).

  - [**Reports Reader**](/azure/active-directory/roles/permissions-reference#reports-reader) Microsoft Entra role.
