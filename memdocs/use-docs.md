# How to use Microsoft Intune documentation

This article provides resources and tips for using the Microsoft Intune product family documentation library. It applies to Configuration Manager, Microsoft Intune, Endpoint analytics, and Autopilot, and covers the following areas:

- How to search
- Submitting doc bugs, enhancements, questions, and new ideas
- How to get notified of changes
- How to contribute to documentation on Microsoft Learn

For general help and support, see:

- [Find help for Configuration Manager](configmgr/core/understand/find-help.md)
- [Get support in Microsoft Intune](get-support.md)

> [!TIP]
> Also visit the **Documentation** node in the **Community** workspace of the Configuration Manager console. This node includes up-to-date information about Configuration Manager documentation and support articles. For more information, see [Using the Configuration Manager console](configmgr/core/servers/manage/admin-console.md#bkmk_doc-dashboard).

Information in this article also applies to the [Configuration Manager PowerShell documentation](/powershell/sccm/overview) in the [sccm-docs-powershell-ref repository](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/sccm-docs-powershell-ref).

## Search

Use the following search tips to help you find the information that you need:

- When using your preferred search engine to locate content, include a keyword along with your search keywords. For example, `ConfigMgr` for Configuration Manager and `Intune` for Intune.

  - Look for results from `learn.microsoft.com/mem`. Results from `learn.microsoft.com/previous-versions`, `technet.microsoft.com`, or `msdn.microsoft.com` are for older product versions.

  - To further focus the search results to the current content library, include `site:learn.microsoft.com` in your query to scope the search engine.

- Use search terms that match terminology in the user interface and online documentation. Avoid unofficial terms or abbreviations that you might see in community content. For example, search for:

  - "management point" rather than "MP"
  - "deployment type" rather than "DT"
  - "Intune management extension" rather than "IME"

- To search within the current article, use your browser's **Find** feature. With most modern web browsers, press **Ctrl**+**F** and then enter your search terms.

- Each article on `learn.microsoft.com` includes the following fields to assist with searching the content:

  - **Search** in the upper right corner. To search all articles, enter terms in this field. Articles in this content library automatically include one of the following search scopes: `ConfigMgr`, `Intune`, or `Autopilot`.

    :::image type="content" source="media/docs-search-field.png" alt-text="Docs search field in header.":::

  - **Filter by title** above the left table of contents. To search the current table of contents, enter terms in this field. This field only matches terms that appear in the article titles for the current node. For example, **Configuration Manager Core Infrastructure** (`learn.microsoft.com/mem/configmgr/core`) or **Intune Apps** (`https://learn.microsoft.com/mem/intune/apps/`). The last item in the search results gives you the option to search for the terms in the entire content library.

    :::image type="content" source="media/docs-filter-toc.gif" alt-text="Animation of using the table of contents filter.":::

Having problems finding something? [File feedback!](#about-feedback) When you file an issue about search results, provide the search engine you're using, the keywords you tried, and the target article. This feedback helps Microsoft optimize the content for better search.

### Add a custom search engine

With many modern web browsers, you can create a custom search engine. Use this feature to quickly and easily search `learn.microsoft.com`. For example, with Microsoft Edge, version 77 and later, use the following process:

1. In Microsoft Edge, version 77 and later, open **Settings**.
1. In the left menu, select **Privacy, search, and services**.
1. Scroll to the bottom of the **Services** group and select **Address bar and search**.
1. Select **Manage search engines**.
1. Select **Add** and specify the following information:

    - **Search engine**: Enter a friendly name to identify it in the list of search engines. For example, `Microsoft Learn`.
    - **Keyword**: Specify a short term to use in the address bar to activate this search engine. For example, `memdocs`.
    - **URL with `%s` in place of query**: For example,

        ```https
        https://learn.microsoft.com/search/index?search=%s&scope=ConfigMgr
        ```

        > [!NOTE]
        > This example is specific to the `ConfigMgr` scope. You can remove the scope variable to search all `learn.microsoft.com` or use a different scope.
        >
        > The Microsoft technical documentation search engine requires a locale in the address. For example, `en-us`. You can change your entry to use a different locale.

    :::image type="content" source="media/docs-search-engine.png" alt-text="Add to Microsoft Edge a custom search engine for Microsoft technical documentation.":::

After you add this search engine, type your keyword in the browser address bar, press `Tab`, then type your search terms, and press `Enter`. It will automatically search Microsoft technical documentation for your specified terms using the defined scope.

## About feedback

Select the **Feedback** link in the upper right of any article to go to the Feedback section at the bottom. Feedback is integrated with GitHub Issues. For more information about this integration with GitHub Issues, see the [docs platform blog post](/teamblog/a-new-feedback-system-is-coming-to-docs).

:::image type="content" source="media/docs-feedback.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the feedback section of a Microsoft Learn article.":::

<!-- To share non-docs feedback about the product itself, select **This product**. This action opens the product's feedback site. 10932544-->

To share feedback about the current article, select **This page**. A [GitHub account](https://github.com/join) is a prerequisite for providing documentation feedback. Once you sign in, there's a one-time authorization for the MicrosoftDocs organization. It then opens the GitHub new issue form. Add a descriptive title and detailed feedback in the body, but don't modify the document details section. Then select **Submit new issue** to file a new issue for the target article in the [MEMDocs GitHub repository](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/memdocs/issues).

To see whether there's already feedback for this article, select **View all page feedback**. This action opens a GitHub issue query for this article. By default it displays both open and closed issues. Review any existing feedback before you submit a new issue. If you find a related issue, select the face icon to add a reaction, add a comment to the thread, or **Subscribe** to receive notifications.

### Types of feedback

Use GitHub Issues to submit the following types of feedback:

- Doc bug: The content is out of date, unclear, confusing, or broken.
- Doc enhancement: A suggestion to improve the article.
- Doc question: You need help with finding existing documentation.
- Doc idea: A suggestion for a new article.
- Kudos: Positive feedback about a helpful or informative article!
- Localization: Feedback about content translation.
- Search engine optimization (SEO): Feedback about problems searching for content. Include the search engine, keywords, and target article in the comments.

If you create an issue for something not related to an article, Microsoft will close the issue and redirect you to a better feedback channel. For example:

- Product feedback for [Configuration Manager](configmgr/core/understand/product-feedback.md) or [Intune](https://feedbackportal.microsoft.com/feedback/forum/ef1d6d38-fd1b-ec11-b6e7-0022481f8472)
- [Product questions](/answers/products/enterprise-mobility-security)
- Support requests for [Configuration Manager](https://aka.ms/cmcbsupport) or [Microsoft Intune](get-support.md)

To share feedback on the Microsoft Learn platform itself, see [Docs feedback](https://aka.ms/sitefeedback). The platform includes all of the wrapper components such as the header, table of contents, and right menu. Also how the articles render in the browser, such as the font, alert boxes, and page anchors.

## Notifications

To receive notifications when content changes in the documentation library, use the following steps:

1. Use the [docs search](/search/) to find an article or set of articles.

    - Search for a single article by title, such as [What's new in Microsoft Intune](/search/?scope=Intune&terms="What%27s%20new%20in%20microsoft%20intune"%2B"learn%20what%27s%20new).

        > [!TIP]
        > To refine the search to a single article, use the full title that displays in the Microsoft technical documentation search results. You can also use a string from the first paragraph, as shown in this example.

        This example results in the following RSS link:

        ```https
        https://learn.microsoft.com/api/search/rss?search=%22What%27s+new+in+microsoft+intune%22%2B%22learn+what%27s+new%22&locale=en-us&facet=&%24filter=scopes%2Fany%28t%3A+t+eq+%27Intune%27%29
        ```

        > [!NOTE]
        > The above RSS feed URL example includes the `&locale=en-us` variable. The `locale` variable is required, but you can change it to another supported locale. For example, `&locale=ja-jp`.

    - Search for any Configuration Manager article about [BitLocker](/search/?search=BitLocker&scope=ConfigMgr)

    > [!NOTE]
    > Use other keywords or the Microsoft Learn search filters to further refine your search query.

1. At the bottom of the list of results, select the **RSS** link.

    :::image type="content" source="media/docs-search-rss.png" alt-text="Screenshot of search results and RSS link.":::

1. Use this feed in an RSS application to receive notifications when there's a change to any of the search results. Refer to the RSS application's documentation on how to configure and tune it.

<!-- Several popular articles in this content library have a tip at the top with a ready-made link to the RSS feed. -->

> [!TIP]
> You can also **Watch** the [MEMDocs repository](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/memdocs) on GitHub. This method can generate _many_ notifications. It also doesn't include changes from the private repository that Microsoft uses.
