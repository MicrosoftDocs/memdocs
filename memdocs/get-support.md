# How to get support in Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center

Microsoft provides global technical, pre-sales, billing, and subscription support for device management cloud-based services, including Intune, Configuration Manager, and Microsoft Managed Desktop. You can access support for all of these from the Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center.

Support is available both online and by phone for paid and trial subscriptions. Online technical support is available in English and Japanese. Phone support and online billing support are available in additional languages.

With administrative access to the admin center, you can use the **Help and Support** option to file an on-line support ticket for a supported service. To create and manage a support incident, your account must have an Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) role that includes the *action* **microsoft.office365.supportTickets**. For information about Azure AD roles and permissions that are required to create a support ticket, see [administrator roles in Azure Active Directory](/azure/active-directory/active-directory-assign-admin-roles-azure-portal).

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> For technical support with third-party products that work with Intune (like Saaswedo, Cisco, or Lookout), contact the supplier of that product first. Before you open a request with Intune support, make sure you configured the other product correctly.

## Access Help and support

Use one of the following links to open the Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center. The link you use depends on how your tenant is hosted:

- **Public cloud**: Use [https://endpoint.microsoft.com](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431)
- **Private cloud** for government, which is also known as a sovereign cloud like Azure Government: Use [https://endpoint.microsoft.us](https://endpoint.microsoft.us)

From within the admin center, use one of the following methods to access Help and support:

- Go to **Troubleshooting + support** > **Help and support** to open the *Help and support* pane.

- From any node in the admin center, select **Help and support** to open the *Help and support* pane.

- From any node in the admin center, select the **?** icon in the upper-right corner to open the *Help* pane. Then, select **Help + support** to open the *Help and support* pane

The following image is an example of accessing help and support for Microsoft Intune by navigating to the Endpoint security node for Intune, and then selecting Help and support:

> ![Navigate to open help and support](./media/get-support/navigate-to-help-and-support.png)

On the *Help and support* pane, select a tile to focus support on the scenario you are seeking assistance for. The following information can help you choose the correct focus:

- **Intune**:
  - Managing devices with Intune
  - Endpoint analytics for Intune devices

- **Configuration Manager**:
  - Desktop Analytics
  - Endpoint analytics for Configuration Manager devices
  - Tenant attach for Configuration Manager devices

  For issues with **on-premises Configuration Manager**, open your case at [www.support.microsoft.com](https://support.microsoft.com).

- **Co-management**:
  - [Co-management workloads](./configmgr/comanage/workloads.md) with Intune or Configuration Manager as the management authority

- **Microsoft Managed Desktop**:
  
  *This tile is available only to Microsoft Managed Desktop customers.*

  - Information requests for the Microsoft Managed Desktop tenant or configuration
  - Change requests to the configuration of Microsoft Managed Desktop devices
  - Reporting an incident or outage

  If you are a Microsoft Managed Desktop customer, selecting that tile for Microsoft Managed Desktop related issues will take you to the Service Requests page. For more information on Service Requests, see [Admin support for Microsoft Managed Desktop](/microsoft-365/managed-desktop/working-with-managed-desktop/admin-support?view=o365-worldwide&preserve-view=true).

> [!TIP]  
> Help and Support might fail to open for newly created tenants, and the following message is presented:
>
> - *We encountered an unknown problem. Please refresh the page but if the problem persists, please create a case through [M365 Admin Center](https://admin.microsoft.com) and reference the session ID provided.*
>
> The error details include a *Session ID*, *Extension* details, and more.
>
> This problem occurs when you've not authenticated and accessed the Need Help from your new tenant account through either the **Microsoft 365 Admin Center** at [https://admin.microsoft.com](https://admin.microsoft.com), or the **Office 365 portal** at [https://portal.office.com](https://portal.office.com). To resolve this problem, select the link for *Microsoft 365 Admin Center* in the message, or visit [https://portal.office.com](https://portal.office.com), and sign in. Following authentication at either site, go to the Admin area and click the Need Help icon in the lower right.  After completeing these steps *Help and Support* for Intune becomes accessible.

## The support experience

After you select a support scenario, the admin center presents the Help and Support page where the support scenario you’ve selected appears at the top **(1)**. If the wrong support scenario was selected, you’ll need to go back to make a different selection:

![View the need help window](./media/get-support/confirm-management-selection.png)

Above the *Need Help?* title are three icons that you can select to open different panes of the *Need Help?* window. The pane your viewing is identified by the underline.

> [!TIP]  
> Customers with a **Premier** or **Unified** support contract have [additional options](#premier-and-unified-support-customers) for support. If you've a Premier or Unified support contract, you'll see a banner thats similar to the following image:
>
> ![Premier banner](./media/get-support/premier-banner.png)

By default, the Help and support page opens to the *Find Solutions* pane. However, if you have an active support case then help and support opens to the Se*rvice requests* pane where you can view details about your active and closed support cases.

### Find solutions

![Select the find solutions pane](./media/get-support/find-solutions.png)

On the *Find solutions* pane, specify a few details about an issue in the provided text box. The pane returns one or more of the following options based on the details you provide:

- **Run diagnostics** – From the console you can start automated tests and investigations of your Tenant that can reveal known issues. When you run a diagnostic, you might receive mitigation steps you can take to help resolve the issue.
- **View insights** – Find links to documentation that provide context and background for the product area or actions you’ve described.
- **Recommended articles** – Follow links to troubleshooting and related content that focus on the issue you’ve described.

For example, for Microsoft Intune you might enter **device enrollment failure**. With these criteria, your results include the option to run Run diagnostics for a user account:

![View troubleshooting insights](./media/get-support/troubleshooting-insights.png)

Running the diagnostics can identify issues for that account in your Azure AD. In this example, the user wasn’t assigned a license for Intune, preventing the device enrollment, and a link to relevant content is provided:

![View the diagnostic results](./media/get-support/diagnostic-resuslts.png)

### Contact support

![Select the contact support pane](./media/get-support/contact-support.png)

From the *contact support* pane, you can submit a request for assistance. This pane is available after you provide some basic keywords on the *find solutions* pane.

When requesting assistance, provide a description of the problem with as much detail as needed. After confirming your phone and email contact information, select the method of contact you prefer. The window displays a response time for each contact method, which gives you an expectation of when you'll be contacted. Before submitting your request, attach files like logs or screenshots that can help fill in details about the issue.

![Contact support form](./media/get-support/contact-support-form.png)

After you fill in the required information, select **Contact me** to submit the request.

### Service requests

![Select the service requests pane](./media/get-support/service-requests.png)

The *Service requests* pane displays your case history. Active cases are at the top of the list, with closed issues also available for review.

![View your service request list](./media/get-support/service-requests-pane.png)

If you have an active support case number, you can enter it here to jump to that issue, or you can select any incident from the list of active and closed incidents to view more information about it.

When you're done viewing details for an incident, select the left arrow that appears at the top of the service request window just above the icons for the three *Need Help?* pane icons. The back arrow returns the display to the list of support incidents you've opened.

## Premier and Unified support customers

As a customer with a **Premier** or **Unified** support contract, you can specify a severity for your issue, and schedule a support callback for a specific time and day. These options are available when you open or submit a new issue and when you edit an active support case.

**Severity** - The options to specify the severity of an issue depend on your support contract:

- *Premier*: Severity of A, B, or C
- *Unified*: Critical, or non-critical

Selecting either a severity **A** or **Critical** issue limits you to a phone support case, which provides the fastest option to get support.

**Callback schedule** - You can request a callback on a specific day and time.
