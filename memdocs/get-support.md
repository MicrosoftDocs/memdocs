# How to get support in the Microsoft Intune admin center

Microsoft provides global technical, pre-sales, billing, and subscription support for device management cloud-based services. These cloud-based services include Intune, Configuration Manager, Windows 365, and Microsoft Managed Desktop. You can access support for all of these options from **Help and support** in the Microsoft Intune admin center. In this article, we explain how to get to Help and support and review your different support options from within the admin center.

To access support resources in the Intune admin center, including creating and managing a support incident, your account must have an Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) role that includes the *action* **microsoft.office365.supportTickets**. Guest users are an exception: they can't file support tickets, even when granted the correct action. For information about Azure AD roles and permissions that are required to create a support ticket, see [administrator roles in Azure Active Directory](/azure/active-directory/active-directory-assign-admin-roles-azure-portal).

Support is available both online and by phone for paid and trial subscriptions. Online technical support is available in English and Japanese. Phone support and online billing support are available in other languages.

## Access Help and support

Use one of the following links to open the Microsoft Intune admin center. The link you use depends on how your tenant is hosted:

- **Public cloud**: Use [https://intune.microsoft.com](https://intune.microsoft.com)
- **Private cloud** for government, which is also known as a sovereign cloud like Azure Government: Use [https://intune.microsoft.us](https://intune.microsoft.us)

To access help and support in the admin center, you have some options:

- Go to **Troubleshooting + support** or another node in the admin center and select **Help and support** to open a full screen experience of Help and support.

  :::image type="content" source="./media/get-support/troubleshooting-support-help-support.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows how to get to help and support from Troubleshooting and support in the Microsoft Intune admin center." lightbox="./media/get-support/troubleshooting-support-help-support.png":::

- From any node in the admin center, or your current area of focus, select the question mark (`?`) near your profile pic to open the Help and Support pane.

  In the following example, select **All services** and then select the question mark (`?`). **Help and support** opens:

  :::image type="content" source="./media/get-support/all-services-question-mark.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows how to get to help and support using home, dashboard, or any other option in the Microsoft Intune admin center." lightbox="./media/get-support/all-services-question-mark.png":::

  When you open **Help and support** this way, it's pinned at the side. You can select any other option and it stays pinned.

### Choose the right support scenario

In **Help and support**, select any available option to focus support on your scenario. You can only see tiles for the services that you have subscriptions to use.

In the following example, you see the different services available in this subscription:

:::image type="content" source="./media/get-support/help-and-support-pinned.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the available help and support services in your subscription in the Microsoft Intune admin center.":::

The following information can help you choose the correct focus:

- **Intune**:
  - Managing devices with Intune
  - Endpoint analytics for Intune devices

- **Configuration Manager**:
  - Endpoint analytics for Configuration Manager devices
  - Tenant attach for Configuration Manager devices

  For issues with **on-premises Configuration Manager**, open your case at [www.support.microsoft.com](https://support.microsoft.com).

- **Co-management**:
  - [Co-management workloads](./configmgr/comanage/workloads.md) with Intune or Configuration Manager as the management authority

- **Microsoft Managed Desktop**:
  
  *This tile is available only to Microsoft Managed Desktop customers.*

  - Information requests for the Microsoft Managed Desktop tenant or configuration
  - Change requests to the configuration of Microsoft Managed Desktop devices
  - Reporting an incident or outage

  If you're a Microsoft Managed Desktop customer, then select the tile for Microsoft Managed Desktop related issues and the Service Requests page is displayed. For more information on Service Requests, see [Admin support for Microsoft Managed Desktop](/microsoft-365/managed-desktop/working-with-managed-desktop/admin-support?view=o365-worldwide&preserve-view=true).

- **Windows 365**:
  - When you have a subscription for Windows 365, this tile opens Help and support for Windows 365.

> [!TIP]  
> Help and Support might fail to open for newly created tenants, and the following message is presented:
>
> - *We encountered an unknown problem. Please refresh the page but if the problem persists, please create a case through [M365 Admin Center](https://admin.microsoft.com) and reference the session ID provided.*
>
> The error details include a *Session ID*, *Extension* details, and more.
>
> This problem occurs when you've not authenticated and accessed the *How can we help?* page from your new tenant account through either the **Microsoft 365 Admin Center** at [https://admin.microsoft.com](https://admin.microsoft.com), or the **Office 365 portal** at [https://portal.office.com](https://portal.office.com). To resolve this problem, select the link for *Microsoft 365 Admin Center* in the message, or visit [https://portal.office.com](https://portal.office.com), and sign in. Following authentication at either site, go to the Admin area and click the Need Help icon in the lower right.  After completing these steps *Help and Support* for Intune becomes accessible.

## Review your support options

When you select a support scenario, the admin center displays the Help and Support page with the support scenario that you selected displayed at the top **(1)**. If the wrong support scenario is selected, you need to go back to make a different selection.

> [!NOTE]
> To access support scenarios in the Intune admin center, your account must have an Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) role that includes the *action* **microsoft.office365.supportTickets**.

:::image type="content" source="./media/get-support/confirm-management-selection.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the How can we help window in the Intune admin center.":::

Above the *How can we help?* title, there are three icons that you can select to open different panes: *Find solutions*, *Contact support*, and *Service requests*. An underlined icon indicates the active pane you’re viewing. By default, the Help and support page opens to the *Find solutions* pane.

> [!TIP]  
> Customers with a **Premier** or **Unified** support contract have [additional options](#premier-and-unified-support-options) for support. If you've a Premier or Unified support contract, you'll see a banner similar to the following image:
>
> :::image type="content" source="./media/get-support/premier-banner.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the premier support option in the Intune admin center.":::

### Search for solutions

:::image type="content" source="./media/get-support/find-solutions.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows how to search for solutions in the Intune admin center.":::

On the *Search for solutions* pane, specify a few details about an issue in the provided text box. The console might offer suggestions based on the details that you enter. Depending on the presence of specific keywords, the console offers one of two support experiences depending on what is available for the product you selected: the traditional support experience and the updated support experience.

#### Traditional experience

For products that use traditional support, when you enter keywords, the *Search for solutions* pane returns one or more of the following options. These options are based on the details you provide:

- **Run diagnostics** – From the console you can start automated tests and investigations of your tenant that can reveal known issues. When you run a diagnostic, you might receive mitigation steps you can take to help resolve the issue.
- **View insights** – Find links to documentation that provide context and background specific to the product area or actions you’ve described.
- **Recommended articles** – Browse suggested to troubleshooting articles and other content related to the issue you’ve described.

For example, for Microsoft Intune you might enter **device enrollment failure**. With these criteria, your results include the option to run diagnostics for a user account:

:::image type="content" source="./media/get-support/troubleshooting-insights.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the need help pane to run diagnostics, view insights, and read recommended articles in the Intune admin center." lightbox="./media/get-support/troubleshooting-insights.png":::

Running the diagnostics can identify issues for that account in Azure AD. In this example, the user wasn’t assigned a license for Intune, preventing the device enrollment, and we see a link to relevant content:

:::image type="content" source="./media/get-support/diagnostic-resuslts.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the diagnostic results in the Intune admin center." lightbox="./media/get-support/diagnostic-resuslts.png":::

#### Updated support experience

*This support experience is currently available for Intune and Co-management.*

Some keywords lead to an enhanced experience that helps you drill down to more scenario-specific support. For example, you're using Microsoft Intune and enter a generic search for *Need help with Intune*. You can see several more focused scenarios and you can select to clarify the problem and find more focused results.

:::image type="content" source="./media/get-support/scenarios-example.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows scenario options in the Intune admin center.":::

When you select a scenario, new options are offered to help narrow down the issue.

:::image type="content" source="./media/get-support/drill-in-scenarios.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows filtered scenario options in the Intune admin center.":::

When presented, you can run automated tests or diagnostics where applicable, and view insightful information to help troubleshoot the problem. You might also see remediation steps to help you fix the issue.

### Contact support

The **Contact Support** option is available after you provide some basic keywords on the *Search for solutions* pane. You can use this pane to file an online support ticket for a supported service.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> For technical support with third-party products that work with Intune (like Cisco or Lookout), contact the supplier of that product first. Before you open a request with Intune support, make sure you configured the other product correctly.

:::image type="content" source="./media/get-support/contact-support.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows how to select the contact support icon in the Intune admin center.":::

When requesting assistance, provide a description of the problem with as much detail as needed. After confirming your phone and email contact information, select the method of contact you prefer. The window displays a response time for each contact method, which gives you an expectation of when you'll be contacted. Before submitting your request, attach files like logs or screenshots that can help fill in details about the issue.

:::image type="content" source="./media/get-support/contact-support-form.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the contact support form in the Intune admin center.":::

After you fill in the required information, select **Contact me** to submit the request.

### Service requests

The *Service requests* pane displays your case history. Active cases are at the top of the list, with closed issues also available for review.

:::image type="content" source="./media/get-support/service-requests.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows your service request list in the Intune admin center.":::

If you have an active support case number, you can enter it here to go to that issue. Or, you can select any incident from the list of active and closed incidents to view more information about it.

When you're done viewing details for an incident, select the left arrow that appears at the top of the service request window just above the icons for the **How can we help?** pane icons. The back arrow returns the display to the list of opened support incidents.

## Premier and Unified support options

As a customer with a **Premier** or **Unified** support contract, you can specify a severity for your issue, and schedule a support callback for a specific time and day. These options are available when you open or submit a new issue and when you edit an active support case.

**Severity** - The options to specify the severity of an issue depend on your support contract:

- *Premier*: Severity of A, B, or C
- *Unified*: Critical, or non-critical

Selecting either a severity **A** or **Critical** issue limits you to a phone support case, which provides the fastest option to get support.

**Callback schedule** - You can request a callback on a specific day and time.
