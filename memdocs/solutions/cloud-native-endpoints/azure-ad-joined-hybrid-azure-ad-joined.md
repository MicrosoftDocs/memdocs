# Microsoft Entra joined vs. Hybrid Microsoft Entra joined in cloud-native endpoints

> [!TIP]
> [!INCLUDE [cloud-native-endpoints-definitions](../../includes/cloud-native-endpoints-definitions.md)]

Many critical and valuable services, including [Conditional Access](/entra/identity/conditional-access/overview) and [Microsoft Entra single sign-on](/entra/identity/enterprise-apps/what-is-single-sign-on), require endpoints to have a cloud identity. For organization owned Windows endpoints, a cloud identity is created when the device is Microsoft Entra joined or Hybrid Microsoft Entra joined.

When moving to cloud-native endpoints, you need to understand the differences between Microsoft Entra joined and hybrid Microsoft Entra joined devices:

- **Microsoft Entra joined**: Devices are joined to Microsoft Entra. They're not joined to on-premises AD.

  For more specific information, go to [Microsoft Entra joined devices](/entra/identity/devices/concept-directory-join) (opens another Microsoft website).

- **Hybrid Microsoft Entra joined**: Devices are registered in Microsoft Entra and joined to an on-premises AD domain.

  For more specific information, go to [Hybrid Microsoft Entra joined devices](/entra/identity/devices/concept-hybrid-join) (opens another Microsoft website).

This feature applies to:

- Windows cloud-native endpoints

This article describes some of the differences between Microsoft Entra joined and hybrid Microsoft Entra joined devices. For an overview of cloud-native endpoints, and their benefits, go to [What are cloud-native endpoints](cloud-native-endpoints-overview.md).

## Microsoft Entra joined

When an endpoint, like a Windows 10/11 device is Microsoft Entra joined, it establishes a trust with Microsoft Entra, and has an identity (`device-id`) in Microsoft Entra. The endpoint is managed and controlled by the organization.

The endpoint is joined to Microsoft Entra. It's not joined to an on-premises AD domain.

To join Windows endpoints to Microsoft Entra, you have some options:

- **Use [Windows Autopilot](/autopilot/index)**. Windows Autopilot guides users through the Windows Out of Box Experience (OOBE). When users enter their work or school account, the endpoint joins Microsoft Entra.

  All devices registered with Windows Autopilot are automatically considered organization owned devices. Windows Autopilot is one of the most adopted approaches to get organization devices joined to Microsoft Entra and managed by IT.  

- **Use Windows Out of Box Experience (OOBE)**. When users enter their work or school account on the device, the endpoint automatically joins Microsoft Entra.

- **Use the Settings app**. On the device, end users open the Settings app (**Accounts** > **Access work or school** > **Connect**), and use their work or school account.

- **Use a Window Provisioning Package**. For more information, go to:

  - [Provisioning packages for Windows](/windows/configuration/provisioning-packages/provisioning-packages)
  - [Bulk join a Windows device to Microsoft Entra and Microsoft Intune using a provisioning package - Microsoft Tech Community](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/intune-customer-success/bulk-join-a-windows-device-to-azure-ad-and-microsoft-endpoint/ba-p/2381400) blog post

### Organization IT benefits

- Using conditional access, you can allow or restrict access to organization resources that meet, or don't meet your requirements.
- Settings and work data roam through enterprise compliant clouds. No personal Microsoft accounts, like Hotmail are used, and can be blocked.
- Using Windows Hello for Business, you can reduce the risk of credential theft.

### End user benefits

- To authenticate end users with Microsoft Entra and the Windows endpoint, users need a work or school account. No personal accounts are used.
- Get single sign-on (SSO) to Microsoft 365 and SaaS apps with an internet connection.
- Use the convenience and security of Windows Hello for Business to sign in to their Windows endpoint.

  When they sign in with Windows Hello for Business, users automatically use SSO to many of their online and on-premises apps and resources.

- OS settings roam across all Microsoft Entra joined devices.

  > [!IMPORTANT]
  > End users working remotely on Microsoft Entra joined devices don't need a VPN to sign-on when cached credentials expire on the device. On hybrid Microsoft Entra joined devices, they do need a VPN to sign in when cached credentials expire.

- [How to plan your Microsoft Entra join implementation](/entra/identity/devices/device-join-plan)
- [Windows Hello for Business documentation - Windows security](/windows/security/identity-protection/hello-for-business/)

## Hybrid Microsoft Entra joined

[Hybrid Microsoft Entra joined devices](/entra/identity/devices/concept-hybrid-join) are joined to your on-premises AD domain and are registered with Microsoft Entra. These devices **require** a network line-of-sight to your on-premises domain controllers (DCs) for initial sign-in and for device management.

If the devices can't connect to the DC, then users might be prevented from signing in, and may not receive policy updates.

Many organizations with existing domain joined devices want the benefits and features of Microsoft Entra and endpoint management. If your devices can't be fully cloud-native yet, then you can register these existing devices with Microsoft Entra. When you register existing devices in Microsoft Entra, a [device identity](/entra/identity/devices/overview) is created, and your devices are hybrid Microsoft Entra joined. They're not considered cloud-native endpoints.

If your organization is ready and wants to be cloud-native, then [Microsoft Entra joined](#microsoft-entra-joined) (in this article) is the correct choice. Existing devices need to be reset. For more specific information and guidance, go to the [High level planning guide](cloud-native-endpoints-planning-guide.md).

### Hybrid Microsoft Entra joined resources

For information on how to register your existing domain joined devices to Microsoft Entra, go to [Configure hybrid Microsoft Entra join](/entra/identity/devices/how-to-hybrid-join). [Configure hybrid Microsoft Entra join](/entra/identity/devices/how-to-hybrid-join) includes information for managed domains and federated domains.

## Which option is right for your organization

The right option depends on your environment, your endpoints, and your organization goals. When making this decision, consider the future and long term impact.

Consider the following scenarios:

| Scenario | Microsoft Entra join or Hybrid Microsoft Entra join |
| --- | --- |
| You're provisioning new Windows endpoints | ✔️ Microsoft Entra join <br/><br/> If you have new, refurbished, or refreshed Windows devices that you're provisioning and enrolling, then Microsoft Entra join is recommended. Windows 10/11 has modern features built in to the OS, including modern management, modern authentication, and more. Microsoft Entra Join should be your default option for new and reset endpoints.<br/><br/>❌ Hybrid Microsoft Entra join <br/><br/> You can use Hybrid Microsoft Entra Join for new endpoints, but it's typically not recommended. When joined using Hybrid Microsoft Entra Join, you might not get to use the modern features built into Windows 10/11.  |
| You have existing, previously provisioned Windows endpoints that are hybrid Microsoft Entra or AD joined | ✔️ Hybrid Microsoft Entra join <br/> <br/>If you have existing endpoints that are joined to an on-premises AD domain (including hybrid Microsoft Entra joined), then hybrid Microsoft Entra join is recommended. Devices get a cloud identity and can use cloud services that require a cloud identity. For end users with existing endpoints, this option has minimal impact. <br/><br/>❌ Microsoft Entra join <br/><br/> Existing devices joined to an on-premises AD domain (including hybrid Microsoft Entra joined) must be reset to become Microsoft Entra joined. If they can't be reset, then there's no supported Microsoft path to Microsoft Entra join them. |

### Common questions, answers, and scenarios

This section answers common questions about Microsoft Entra joined and hybrid Microsoft Entra joined devices.

#### Should hybrid Microsoft Entra joined be a long term or end goal state for devices?

No, Hybrid Microsoft Entra Join shouldn't be long term nor the end goal for any organization.

When you're not restricted or limited (technical, political, or regulatory reasons), your organization should be moving or planning on moving to Microsoft Entra joined for your Windows endpoints.

#### What strategy should an organization adopt to move existing Hybrid Microsoft Entra Join devices to Microsoft Entra Join?

The strategy depends on many factors, many that are specific to your organization.

In general, Microsoft recommends waiting for a complementary event. For example, you can move to Microsoft Entra Join during a hardware refresh, OS upgrade, or device troubleshooting scenario when there's a new (or reset) instance of Windows. Using this approach, you minimize user disruption and streamline the conversion process to Microsoft Entra Join. Remember, there's no Microsoft supported process or path to convert an existing device from Hybrid Microsoft Entra Join to Microsoft Entra Join without a Windows reset.

On Microsoft Entra hybrid joined devices, you must do a full device wipe, as [Windows Autopilot Reset](/autopilot/windows-autopilot-reset) doesn't support Microsoft Entra hybrid joined devices.

To move to Microsoft Entra Join, you can proactively reset existing devices. This approach can be more disruptive to users and requires more planning & testing. But you can use this approach if you have a few devices or if you have a strong business case to move to Microsoft Entra Join.

#### There's a blocker that prevents my organization from moving to Microsoft Entra Join

It's possible there are blockers and challenges outside of Microsoft's control that can prevent your organization from fully moving to Microsoft Entra Join. There may also be unknown blockers that are specific to your organization and its configuration or expectations. These blockers can be technical or happen for other, nontechnical reasons.

Remember, moving to Microsoft Entra Join isn't an all or nothing proposition. Moving devices to Microsoft Entra Join takes time, even with or without blockers or inhibitors.

If you identify a potential blocker that's preventing you from using Microsoft Entra Join, then determine the scope, impact, and solution. The [High level planning guide to move to cloud-native endpoints](cloud-native-endpoints-planning-guide.md) can help.

#### Can Microsoft Entra Join and Hybrid Microsoft Entra Join endpoints coexist in the same environment?

Yes, Microsoft Entra Join and Hybrid Microsoft Entra Join endpoints can coexist in the same environment. They aren't mutually exclusive.

Having a mixed environment does increase complexity, maintenance, and support costs. But you can use Hybrid Microsoft Entra Join until those endpoints are replaced or reset. Remember, Hybrid Microsoft Entra Join shouldn't be your organization's end goal for Windows endpoint state.

#### Can users on Microsoft Entra Join systems access on-premises resources?

Yes, users on Microsoft Entra Join systems can access on-premises resources.

Microsoft Entra Join endpoints can access on-premises resources, and can use single sign-on (SSO). For more specific information, go to [Cloud-native endpoints and on-premises resources](cloud-native-endpoints-on-premises.md).

#### What device join states can Intune manage?

Microsoft Intune, which is a 100% cloud solution, can manage Windows client devices that are Microsoft Entra Join or Hybrid Microsoft Entra Join. Intune has many built-in features and settings that can manage settings, control device features, help secure your endpoints, and more.

The [High level planning guide to move to cloud-native endpoints: Intune features you should know](cloud-native-endpoints-planning-guide.md#intune-features-you-should-know) lists some of these features. [What is Intune](../../intune/fundamentals/what-is-intune.md) is also a good resource.

On Hybrid Microsoft Entra Join endpoints, you can use on-premises group policies objects (GPO) or Intune to control policy settings. It's possible to also use a combination of GPO and Intune, but this combination adds administrative overhead and complexity. If you enable [co-management](../../configmgr/comanage/overview.md) (Intune (cloud) + Configuration Manager (on-premises)), then you can use some Microsoft Entra features, such as conditional access.

For some guidance, go to [Deployment guide: Setup or move to Microsoft Intune](../../intune/fundamentals/deployment-guide-intune-setup.md).

#### What device join states are required for device compliance and/or conditional access?

Both Hybrid Microsoft Entra Join and Microsoft Entra Join endpoints support [compliance policies](../../intune/protect/device-compliance-get-started.md) and [conditional access](../../intune/protect/conditional-access.md) when managed by Intune or co-managed by Intune and Configuration Manager.

#### Are there limitations for Hybrid Microsoft Entra Join?

Yes, there are limitations for Hybrid Microsoft Entra Join.

These limitations are generally the same with on-premises only domain joined devices. Specifically, Hybrid Microsoft Entra Join endpoints require a line-of-sight to the on-premises AD domain controller for initial sign-in and to change passwords. If the domain is down or is unavailable, then users could be blocked from signing in to their endpoints. If your organization is moving away from having an on-premises domain, then you must also move away from Hybrid Microsoft Entra Join for your devices.

If you use [passwordless authentication](/entra/identity/authentication/concept-authentication-passwordless), then users need internet access and a line of sight to the domain controllers (DCs). To authenticate, Hybrid Microsoft Entra Join endpoints can use kerberos and NTLM.

#### Is Hybrid Microsoft Entra Join considered cloud-native?

No, Hybrid Microsoft Entra Join isn't considered cloud-native.

The cloud solution is to Microsoft Entra Join your endpoints. The endpoints and their identities are created and stored in Microsoft Entra. Intune manages the endpoints with settings and policies. These services work with other cloud services, including Microsoft 365, Microsoft Defender XDR, and more.
