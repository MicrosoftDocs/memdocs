# Check compliance status in Microsoft Intune app   
*Applies to Microsoft Intune app for Android*  

Use the Microsoft Intune app for Android to remotely check the status of a device, and confirm or resolve access issues caused by noncompliant settings. 

During a status check, the Intune app assesses the *device settings status* on an enrolled device, and reports whether or not the settings are compliant with your organization's requirements. If your device doesn't meet requirements, your organization may limit or restrict it from accessing internal resources. When applicable, the status provides information about how to maintain or regain access.     

## Check status    
To check the status of a device:  

1. Open the Microsoft Intune app for Android.  

2. Tap **Devices**, and then select your device.  

The status is shown under **Device settings status**. The **Last checked** timestamp shows the date and time the last check occurred.  

## Status descriptions  

The Intune app reports the following status:         

* **Compliant**: Your device is allowed to access work or school resources.  
* **This device will soon be unable to access company resources**: Your device is allowed to access work or school resources, but one or more settings don't meet your organization's requirements. Update your device settings by the date shown to keep your access.  
* **Noncompliant**: Your device isn't allowed to access work or school resources. Make the required changes to gain access.  

## Next steps  
Requirements and next steps are determined by your organization's policies. If you're required to make any changes to your device, the Intune app will include that information next to the device settings status. For specific questions about your organization's requirements, contact your support person.
