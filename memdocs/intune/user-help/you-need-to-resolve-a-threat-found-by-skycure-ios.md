# Resolve a threat found by Symantec Endpoint Protection Mobile on iOS

Symantec Endpoint Protection (SEP) Mobile is a Mobile Threat Defender service that identifies potential threats on your Android devices. These threats are reported to the Company Portal app, and appear as unresolved, noncompliant issues. If your device is identified as being noncompliant, you may be unable to:

* Connect to corporate e-mail
* Connect to corporate Wi-Fi
* Connect to SharePoint Online
* Sync corporate files with OneDrive
* Access company apps

This article describes how to regain access to your company's resources when SEP Mobile detects a security or app threat.  

## Troubleshoot a virus or security threat

1. When you attempt to access company email or websites, you'll receive a message like the one shown in the screenshot below. Tap the **device management portal** link to open the [Company Portal website](https://portal.manage.microsoft.com/devices).

    ![Example screenshot of a Lookout for Work error message, with a link to Company Portal website and blue OK button.](./media/mtd-go-to-device-management-portal-android.png)  

2. Select your device.  
3. Read the warning that appears below your device. It will instruct you to open SEP Mobile to fix the virus or security threat.

## Troubleshoot an app threat

If you install an app that's seen as a threat to your device, you'll receive a notification within the SEP Mobile app. If the affected app remains on your device, you'll be unable to access company resources.  

To resolve, select the app from the list of threats in SEP Mobile. Then follow the on-screen instructions to remove and uninstall the app.  

Still need help? Check in with your company support. You can find their contact information on the [Company Portal website](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2010980).
