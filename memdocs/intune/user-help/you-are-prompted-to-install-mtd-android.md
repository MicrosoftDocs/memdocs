# Install Mobile Threat Defense on your Android device

Before you can access your work, your company needs you to install a Mobile Threat Defense app, which helps to protect your device by finding potential security threats. You might see different prompts on your device, depending on how your company set it up.

* [Lookout for Work](you-are-prompted-to-install-lookout-for-work-android.md)
* [Symantec Endpoint Protection Mobile](you-are-prompted-to-install-skycure-android.md)
* [SandBlast Mobile Protect](you-are-prompted-to-install-sandblast-android.md)
* [Zimperium zIPS](you-are-prompted-to-install-zips-android.md)

**If the installation doesn't work**

Sometimes installations can fail due to technical issues beyond your control. If this happens, contact your company support. For contact information, check the [Company Portal website](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2010980).
