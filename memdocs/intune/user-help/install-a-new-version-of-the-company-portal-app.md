Get the latest version of the Microsoft Intune Company Portal app on your Android, iOS, macOS, or Windows device. We recommend using the latest version of the Company Portal app on your device because it contains the latest bug fixes and security updates. 

Your organization may require you to update the app on your device when:  

* A newer version of Company Portal becomes available.  
* Your version of Company Portal is no longer supported.  

If an update is required, you'll receive a notification from Company Portal.  

## Update on Android device  

Google Play Store will notify you when a new version of the Company Portal is available. You won't see a prompt in the Company Portal app itself. Select the Google Play alert and follow the onscreen prompts to update the app. 

## Update on iOS device  

When a new version of Company Portal becomes available, you'll see an **Update** option in the App Store. 

1. Open the App Store and search for **Intune**.  
2. Look for the **Update** option next to the Intune Company Portal listing. If available, tap **Update**. 
3. Follow the onscreen prompts to install the update.
4. After you've installed the update, return to Company Portal > **Devices**. 
5. Select the device that you're currently using.
6. Select **Check Status** to sync your changes.  

> [!NOTE]
> The minimum supported version of the iOS Company Portal app is v5.2205. If your users are running v5.2204 or below, they will be prompted to update the iOS Company Portal app at login.
