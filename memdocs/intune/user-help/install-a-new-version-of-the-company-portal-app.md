# Update the Company Portal app  

**Applies to**  
- Android  
- iOS  
- macOS  
- Windows 10  
- Windows 11  

 
Get the latest version of the Microsoft Intune Company Portal app on your Android, iOS, macOS, or Windows device. We recommend using the latest version of the Company Portal app on your device because it contains the latest bug fixes and security updates. 

Your organization may require you to update the app on your device when:  

* A newer version of Company Portal becomes available.  
* Your version of Company Portal is no longer supported.  

If an update is required, you'll receive a notification from Company Portal.  

## Update on Android device  

Google Play Store notifies you when a new version of the Company Portal is available. You won't see a prompt in the Company Portal app itself. Select the Google Play alert and follow the onscreen prompts to update the app. 

## Update on iOS device  

Check for available Company Portal updates in the App Store. For more information, see the Apple Support article for [How to manually update apps on your Apple device](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202180). After you install available updates: 

1. Go to the Company Portal app > **Devices**.   
2. Select the device that you're currently using.  
3. Select **Check Status** to sync your changes.  

> [!NOTE]
> The minimum supported version of the iOS Company Portal app is v5.2205. If your users are running v5.2204 or below, they will be prompted to update the iOS Company Portal app at login.

## Update on macOS device  

To view and install available updates on a macOS device: 

1. Open Company Portal and go to **Help**.  
2. Select **Check for updates** and then select the available update to begin installation.  
4. When the update is complete, return to Company Portal > **Devices**. 
5. Select the device that you're currently using.
6. Select **More [...]** and then choose **Check Status** to sync your device.  

To turn on automatic app updates: 
1. Open Company Portal and go to **Help**.  
2. Select **Check for updates**.
3. On the Microsoft AutoUpdate screen, select **Automatically download and install**.  

## Update on Windows 10/11 device  
To view available updates for Company Portal on a Windows device, open the Microsoft Store and select **Get Updates**. After you install your app updates, go to the Company Portal app and select the device you're currently using. Then select **Check access** to sync your device. 

You can turn on automatic updates to ensure that you don't miss updates. For more information, see [Turn on automatic app updates](https://support.microsoft.com/windows/turn-on-automatic-app-updates-70634d32-4657-dc76-632b-66048978e51b). Organizations may disable automatic app updates. If this option is unavailable on your device, use the first set of Windows 10/11 instructions (Microsoft Store > **Get Updates**) to update your app.
