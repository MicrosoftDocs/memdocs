# How to update the Company Portal app

This article describes how to update your version of the Company Portal app when:  
* There's a newer version of Company Portal available.
* Your version of Company Portal is no longer supported.

These steps describe how to update or get the latest version of the app on Android, iOS, macOS, and Windows devices.    

## Update the Company Portal app on your Android device  

Google Play Store alerts you when a new version of the Company Portal is available. You won't see a prompt in the Company Portal app itself. Select the store's alert and follow its instructions to update the app. 

## Update the Company Portal app on your iOS device  

When a new version is available, an **Update** option appears in your list of installed apps, next to the Company Portal app.  

1. Open the App Store and search for **Intune**.  
2. When you find the app, tap **Update**.  

## Update the Company Portal app on your macOS device

Set up Company Portal to automatically install updates as they become available. 

1. Open Company Portal and go to **Help**. 
2. Select **Check for updates**. 
3. On the Microsoft AutoUpdate screen, select **Automatically download and install**. 

To view available updates, select **Check for updates**.  

## Update the Company Portal app on your Windows device
To automatically get updates as they become available, open Microsoft Store and go to  **Settings**. Then turn on **App updates**. To view recent updates, and apps waiting in the download queue, go to **Downloads and updates**.  

Complete the following steps if you prefer to manually update the app, or if **App Updates** are disabled by your company.  
1. Open Microsoft Store.
2. In the search bar, type **Company Portal**.
3. Click the app to install the latest version on your device.
