# Update the Company Portal app  

**Applies to**  
- Android  
- iOS

- Windows 10  
- Windows 11  

 
Get the latest version of the Microsoft Intune Company Portal app on your Android, iOS, macOS, or Windows device. We recommend using the latest version of the Company Portal app on your device because it contains the latest bug fixes and security updates. 

You might be required to update the app on your work or school device when:  

* A newer version of Company Portal becomes available.  
* Your version of Company Portal is no longer supported.  

Company Portal sends notifications to your device when an update is required.  

## Update on Android device  

Google Play Store notifies you when a new version of the Company Portal is available. You won't see a prompt in the Company Portal app itself. Select the Google Play alert and follow the onscreen prompts to update the app. 

## Update on iOS device  

Check for available Company Portal updates in the App Store. For more information, see the Apple Support article for [How to manually update apps on your Apple device](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202180). After you install updates, sync your device in Company Portal.   

1. Open Company Portal and go to **Devices**.   
2. Select the device that you're currently using.  
3. Select **Check Status** to sync your changes.  

> [!NOTE]
> The minimum supported version of the Company Portal app for iOS/iPadOS is v5.2311.1. If you're running an older version, you will be prompted to update the Company Portal app when you sign in.

## Update on macOS device  

To view and install available updates on a macOS device: 

1. Open Company Portal and go to **Help**.  
2. Select **Check for updates**, and then select the available update to begin installation.  
4. When the update is complete, return to Company Portal > **Devices**. 
5. Select the device that you're currently using.
6. Select **More [...]** and then choose **Check Status** to sync your device.  

To turn on automatic app updates: 
1. Open Company Portal and go to **Help**.  
2. Select **Check for updates**.
3. On the Microsoft AutoUpdate screen, select **Automatically download and install**.  

## Update on Windows device  
To view available updates for Company Portal for Windows 10/11, open the Microsoft Store and select **Get Updates**. 
1. Open Company Portal and go to **Devices**.
2. Select the device you're currently using. 
3. Select **Check access** to sync your device. 

You can turn on automatic updates to ensure that you don't miss updates. For more information, see [Turn on automatic app updates](https://support.microsoft.com/windows/turn-on-automatic-app-updates-70634d32-4657-dc76-632b-66048978e51b). Your organization can disable automatic app updates.
