# Make your device safer with the right password

Accessing corporate resources, such as email and documents, is something that people need to do every day from their Windows devices. Your organization wants to make sure that your device is doing this safely. One way to make sure that your device is securely accessing these resources is requiring devices to use a password. These passwords are used, for example, to access your device from the lock screen.

If your Windows device doesn't comply with your company support's password policy, you will see a message that briefly describes the issue and explains what you need to do to make your password meet the requirements.

> [!Note]
> Your company support can set more than one password requirement. For example, the password might have to be a certain number of characters, and it might have to be a mix of numbers and letters. Because more than one requirement might be set, these instructions explain only how to set or change your password. They don't explain every possible combination of requirements.
