# Check compliance on your Android device  
Manually start a device check-in from the Company Portal to:

* Update your device status 
* Regain access to your work or school resources 

During a check-in, Company Portal will confirm that the settings on your device meet your organization's policy requirements.  Your organization can limit or restrict access to work or school resources until you check in.  

If you recently made changes to your device settings, you may need to manually check in to register these changes with Company Portal. 

1. Open the Company Portal app for Android on your device.  

2. Tap **Devices** and then select your device.  

3. Under **Device Settings Status**, tap **Check device settings**. Company Portal will check your device to confirm that it's meeting your organization's policy requirements. 

4. After the check, your device settings status will either read, **In Compliance** or **Not in Compliance**. If you're required to make any changes, a message will appear at the top of the screen. Tap it for more details. 

For contact information, check the [Company Portal website](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2010980).
