# Check compliance in Company Portal app for Android     
*Applies to Intune Company Portal app for Android*  

Use the Intune Company Portal app to remotely check the status of an enrolled device, and confirm or resolve access issues caused by noncompliant settings. During a status check, Company Portal confirms whether or not the selected device meets your organization's requirements. If your device doesn't meet requirements, your organization may limit or restrict it from accessing internal resources until you make changes.     

>[!TIP]
> After you update the settings on a noncompliant device, we recommend running a status check to register the changes with the Intune app.  

1. Open the Company Portal app for Android on your device.  

2. Tap **Devices** and then select your device.  

3. Under **Device Settings Status**, tap **Check device settings**. Company Portal will check your device to confirm that it's meeting your organization's policy requirements. 

4. After the check, your device settings status will either read, **In Compliance** or **Not in Compliance**. If you're required to make any changes, a message will appear at the top of the screen. Tap it for more details. 

For contact information, check the [Company Portal website](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2010980).
