# Check compliance on your Android device

If your device hasn't checked in with Intune in a while, you might not be able to access your company or school resources. Try these steps to regain access.  

1. Open the Company Portal app for Android on your device.  

2. Tap **Check device settings**.   

If you are unable to reset your lost or stolen device, ask your company support to reset it for you. For contact information, check the [Company Portal website](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2010980).
