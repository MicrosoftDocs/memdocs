# Turn off Microsoft data collection on Android device  

This article describes how to prevent Microsoft from collecting data about your Microsoft Intune or Company Portal usage. To turn off data collection in these apps:  

1. Open the Microsoft Intune or Company Portal app on your Android device.  
2. Select the menu button > **Settings**.
3. Turn the **Usage Data** toggle off.    

## Allowing Microsoft data collection   

When usage data is turned on, your in-app performance and usage data is automatically anonymized and shared with Microsoft. This type of data helps us improve the reliability and performance of Microsoft products. Your organization doesn't have control over the collection of this data and cannot change your preferences.    

## Next steps  

Still need help? Contact your IT support person. For contact information, check the Intune Company Portal app, [Company Portal website](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2010980), or Microsoft Intune app.
