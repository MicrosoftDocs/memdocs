# Turn off Microsoft usage data collection

Microsoft automatically collects certain data about products and services. The data is used to improve the reliability and performance of apps, like Company Portal and Microsoft Intune. Even though this data is anonymized, some users may not feel comfortable with this collection. Your organization doesn't have control over the collection of this data, and they can't change your setting selection.   

To turn off data collection on your Android device:  

1. Open the Company Portal or Microsoft Intune app.
2. Select **Settings**.
3. Under the usage data setting, flip the switch to the off position.
