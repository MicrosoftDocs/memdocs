# Enroll device with Android work profile

Enroll your personal Android device to get access to work or school email, apps, and other data. During enrollment, you'll set up an Android work profile, which separates the personal data on your device from your work data. If this type of setup is something you're required to do, your organization will let you know through their preferred communication channel or Intune Company Portal app. 

After your profile is set up, your organization will manage the work-side of it, which consists of only the work files and work data. Your IT administrator can configure and enforce certain device-level settings on your device, such as requiring you to set a device PIN. They can't see any data in the apps on the personal side of your device.

## Create work profile and enroll device

> [!NOTE]
> To create a work profile on your device, you must be using the primary user account on your device. Creating a work profile on a secondary user account is not supported. 

1. Open the Company Portal app and sign in with your work or school account. If you haven't installed the free app, install it from [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.microsoft.windowsintune.companyportal).  

2. On the **Company Access Setup** screen, tap **BEGIN**.

    If you're not ready to install apps, you can always access them later by going directly to the badged version of the Google Play app. You can also select **Get Apps** from the Company Portal menu.

## Android Enterprise availability 

Work profile setup is supported in [countries and regions where Android Enterprise is available](https://support.google.com/work/android/answer/6270910) (opens Google Support website). Company Portal can't set up a work profile on your device if you're outside these areas. If Android Enterprise isn't available in your country or region, ask your support person for other ways to access work resources.  

## Next steps  

Now that your device is enrolled, you can install school or work apps on your device. Go to the managed Google Play store to find and install these apps.
