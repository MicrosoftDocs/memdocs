## Android Enterprise availability 

Work profiles are supported in [countries and regions where Android Enterprise is available](https://support.google.com/work/android/answer/6270910) (opens Google Support website). Company Portal can't set up a work profile on your device if you're outside these areas. If Android Enterprise isn't available in your country or region, ask your support person for other ways to access work resources.  

## Update Google Play services  

If the version of Google Play services on your device is outdated, you may be unable to enroll your device. [Open Google Play services](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.gms) on your device to check for available updates. For more information about how to update Android apps, see [Update your Android apps](https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/113412)(opens Google Support website).  

## Next steps  
Install the apps you need for work or school. Switch to your work profile to see all available apps, and search for more apps in the work version of Google Play Store.
