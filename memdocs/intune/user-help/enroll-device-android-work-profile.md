# Enroll device with Android work profile

Enroll your personal Android device to get access to work or school email, apps, and other data. During enrollment, you'll set up an Android work profile. This profile separates the personal data on your device from your work data. Your organization manages the work profile, which consists of work files and data. Your company support can't manage the personal data on your device.

2. On the **Company Access Setup** screen, tap **BEGIN**.
