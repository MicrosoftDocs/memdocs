**Applies to**  

- Windows 10  
- Windows 11  


If you receive a message that you need to enable code integrity, contact your support person. They can help you enable Secure Boot, which will trigger code integrity the next time you start up your device. 

If you're using a PC and consider yourself an advanced user, you can enable Secure Boot through the PC BIOS menu. For instructions, see [Re-enable Secure Boot](/windows-hardware/manufacture/desktop/disabling-secure-boot#re-enable-secure-boot).  


## What is code integrity? 
Code integrity is a threat protection feature that checks the drivers and system files on your device for signs of corruption or malicious software. For code integrity to work on your device, another security feature called Secure Boot must be enabled.
