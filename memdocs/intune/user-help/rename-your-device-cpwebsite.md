# Rename your device from the Company Portal website  

**Applies to:**

* Android
* iOS/iPadOS
* macOS
* Windows 10/11  

Rename a device on the Company Portal website. If you use more than one device for work or school, renaming them can make it easier to recognize and manage them when you're in Company Portal.   

1. On any device, sign in to the [Company Portal website](https://portal.manage.microsoft.com) with your work or school account.  
2. Go to **Devices**.  
3. Select the device you want to rename.  
4. Select **Rename**. If the rename option isn't visible at the top of your page, select the **More (…)** menu to check the overflow actions.  
5. Enter a new name for your device. Then select **Rename** to save your changes.  

Need additional help? Contact your IT support person. For contact details, go to **Helpdesk** on the Company Portal website.  

>[!NOTE]
>The rename action on the Company Portal website gives employees and students the chance to rename enrolled devices to something that's easy to recognize. This change only applies to the name in Company Portal, and not to the device name or management name that appears in the Microsoft Intune admin center. If you're an IT administrator and need more information about managing device details in the admin center, see:
