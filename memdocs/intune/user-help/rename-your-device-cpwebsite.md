# Rename your device from the Company Portal website

Rename an enrolled, managed device from the Company Portal website. Change a device's generic or default model name to a name that you can quickly identify.

1. Open the [Company Portal website](https://portal.manage.microsoft.com) and select the __Menu__ button > __Devices__.  

2. Select the device you want to rename.

3. Select **Rename**. If the rename option isn't visible at the top of your page, select **More (â€¦)** > **Rename**.
