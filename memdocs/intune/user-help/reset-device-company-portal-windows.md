# Reset device in Company Portal app for Windows  

**Applies to**  
- Windows 10  
- Windows 11  
- Windows 10 Mobile  
- Windows Phone 8.1

Use the Company Portal app for Windows to reset a used, lost, or stolen device back to factory settings. All apps, settings, and personal data on the device will be deleted and the device will no longer appear in Company Portal.  

The reset option may not be available for every device that appears in Company Portal. Your organization can choose to hide the option.  


## Reset device   
To reset a device to its original, out-of-box settings:  

1. Open the Company Portal app on any managed device and sign in with your work or school account.
2. Select **DEVICES**. 
3. Select the device you want to reset.
4. Select **Actions** > **Reset**.    
5. Select **Reset** to start wiping the device.   

## Reset limitations  
Company Portal device resets aren't supported on all devices. The feasibility of a reset depends on the Windows version and how your organization configured their policies. This table lists the expected outcomes for various Windows devices and configurations.

## Next steps 

* You can also [reset a device from the Company Portal website](reset-device-company-portal-website.md).

* If you just want to remove your device from Company Portal, see [Remove your Windows device from management](unenroll-your-device-from-intune-windows.md). Removing the device effectively removes it from Intune and may cause you to lose access to the work-related content on your device.
