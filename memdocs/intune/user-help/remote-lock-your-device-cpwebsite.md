# Remotely lock your device from the Company Portal website

Remotely lock a lost or stolen device from the Company Portal website. If supported on your device, this setting locks your device's screen, no matter where the device is. A person must enter the correct passcode before the device can be unlocked and used again.   

The remote lock setting works for:

* Android
* iOS
* macOS
* Windows 10
* Windows 10 Mobile (if the device already had a passcode set)
* Windows Phone 8.1 (if the device already had a passcode set)  

1. On the [Company Portal website](https://portal.manage.microsoft.com), select the __Menu__ button > __Devices__.  

2. Select the device you want to lock.  

    ![A screenshot of the Devices page, with 2 tiles that show unidentified, generically named devices. A gray banner sits directly below the devices and prompts user to identify the device they are using or add a new one.](./media/rename-reset-device-step2-1808.png) 

3. Select **Remote lock**. If the lock option isn't visible at the top of your page, select **More (â€¦)** > **Remote lock**.

    ![Zoomed in view of the More icon, highlighted with a red arrow.](./media/rename-reset-device-step3-more-1808.png)    

4. A message appears to warn you that you are about to lock your device. Tap **Remote lock** to confirm.

After the confirmation, the Company Portal attempts to lock your device. A "Remote lock pending" message appears during this time. When your device is locked, the status appears as "Remote lock successful."  

The Remote Lock status displays in three places:

* The notifications area of the website.
* The **Details** page for the device.
* The tile that shows the device name on the **Devices** section of the page.  

> [!Note]
> If you see a notification that the remote lock failed, wait a few minutes. Then try to lock your device again. The status will change back to "Remote lock pending." If the retry doesn't work, contact your company support for help.

If you find your device and want to unlock it after using Remote Lock, just enter your passcode.  

Still need help? Contact your company support. For contact information, check the [Company Portal website](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2010980).
