# Turn off Microsoft data collection on AOSP device  

When usage data is turned on in the Microsoft Intune app, your in-app performance and usage data is automatically anonymized and shared with Microsoft. This type of data helps us improve the reliability and performance of Microsoft products. Your organization doesn't have control over the collection of this data and can't change your preferences.  

To turn off data collection:    

1. Open the Intune app.  
2. Select the menu button > **Settings**.
3. Turn **Usage data** off.
