# Upload and email logs  

If you experience a problem in the Company Portal or Microsoft Intune app, you can email the details of the problem to your company support person. These details will provide them with additional context about the problem.  

The actual error details are kept on your device in a special document called a _diagnostic log_. When you upload the logs to the Company Portal or Microsoft Intune app, they're first sent to the Microsoft developers that work on the app. They use the logs to improve the app's functionality and prevent future errors. An incident ID for your specific error is then provided to you to share with your company support person, for use in Microsoft Support cases.  

> [!Note]
> To make it easier for your company support to find the cause of the problem, turn on _verbose logging_ in Company Portal. If you're using the Microsoft Intune app, set the **Log detail level** to **Verbose**. Verbose logging records all details about an error and includes these details in the report. Find out how to [turn on verbose logging here](use-verbose-logging-to-help-your-it-administrator-fix-device-issues-android.md).
