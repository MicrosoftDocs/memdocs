# Upload and email logs  

If you experience a problem in the Company Portal or Microsoft Intune app, you can email the details of the problem to your company support person. These details will give them more context about the problem.  

The actual error details are kept on your device in a special document called a _diagnostic log_. When you upload the logs to the Company Portal or Microsoft Intune app, they're first sent to the Microsoft developers that work on the app. They use the logs to improve the app's functionality and prevent future errors. An incident ID for your specific error is then provided to you to share with your company support person, for use in Microsoft Support cases. 

This article describes how to send app logs from the Company Portal and Microsoft Intune apps, and how to access the logs in your work profile.  


> [!Note]
> To make it easier for your company support to find the cause of the problem, turn on _verbose logging_ in Company Portal. If you're using the Microsoft Intune app, set the **Log detail level** to **Verbose**. Verbose logging records all details about an error and includes these details in the report. Find out how to [turn on verbose logging here](use-verbose-logging-to-help-your-it-administrator-fix-device-issues-android.md).  
>
> If you are using a Sovereign cloud environment, the send logs functionality in the Company Portal will not be available to you. You must send logs via email.

1. In the Company Portal app, there are two ways to initiate email support.

    > [!NOTE]
    > **Menu** could be a software button or a hardware button, depending on which Android device you have.  

3. Tap **Send Email & Upload Logs**.  
4. After the upload is complete, tap your email app. 
5. An email message will open with the incident ID pre-populated in the subject field. In the body of the email, describe the problem that you came across.
