# Manually sync Android device with Intune  

 A manual sync forces your device to connect with Intune to get the latest updates, requirements, and communications from your organization. Company Portal regularly syncs devices as long as you're connected to Wi-Fi. If you've been disconnected from Wi-Fi for an extended period of time, you can use the manual sync feature to get any policies and updates you missed.    
 
Syncing can also help resolve work-related downloads or other processes that are in progress or stalled. If you're experiencing slow or unusual behavior while installing or using a work app, or if you're missing a work app that you know you're supposed to have, try syncing your device.   


## Sync device  
To force a sync:    

1. Sign in to the Company Portal app.

2. Tap the menu. 
3. Tap **Settings**.  
4. Scroll down to **Management Policy** and tap **Sync**. 
5. Wait while Company Portal syncs your device. When complete, the screen will show the timestamp of the last successful sync. 


## Next steps  
Once you've completed these steps, you may receive notifications from Company Portal about updating your device settings. Microsoft Docs offers step-by-step articles to help guide you through these updates. To find these articles in the table of contents, choose **Android device management** > **Update device settings**.  

The Company Portal **Sync** feature is different from the **Check device settings** feature. The latter feature forced Company Portal to check your device to make sure its current settings meet your organization's requirements. You should check your device after you've made a required change to a device setting so that you don't lose access to your work or school apps. For more information about this feature, see [Check device compliance](check-compliance-on-your-device-android.md).
