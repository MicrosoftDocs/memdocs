# Enroll your corporate device with the Microsoft Intune app

Enroll your corporate-owned Android device to get secure access to company email, apps, and other data that your organization makes available. The Microsoft Intune app supports corporate-owned devices running Android 6.0 and later. It will be automatically installed on new and factory-reset devices during enrollment. 

There are four ways to enroll. Your organization should let you know which option to use.
 
* Near Field Communication (NFC)  
* Token  
* QR Code   
* Google Zero Touch  

## Enroll device 
Complete these steps to set up and enroll your device.  

> [!NOTE]
> The Android version or device manufacturer might require you to complete additional steps that aren't covered in this procedure. The colors and text you see in the screenshots might also appear different on your device.  

1. Turn on your new or factory-reset device.  
2. On the **Welcome** screen, select your language.   If you've been instructed to enroll with a QR code or NFC, follow the step below that matches the method.  
     * NFC: Tap your NFC-supported device against a programmer device to connect to your organization's network. Follow the onscreen prompts. When you reach the screen for Chrome's Terms of Service, continue to step 5.  

     * QR code: Complete the steps in [QR code enrollment](#qr-code-enrollment).  

     If you've been instructed to use another method, continue to step 3.    

3. Connect to Wi-Fi and tap **NEXT**. Follow the step that matches your enrollment method. 

    * Token: When you get to the Google sign-in screen, complete the steps in [Token enrollment](#token-enrollment).  
    * Google Zero Touch: After you connect to Wi-Fi, your device will be recognized by your organization. Continue to step 4 and follow the onscreen prompts until setup is complete.
