# Change User Access Control setting  

**Applies to:**
* Windows 10  
* Windows 11  

The User Access Control settings help prevent potentially harmful programs and software from making changes to your device. If you've received a message about adjusting these controls on an enrolled work or school device, it means that your organization requires your device to have more protection. This article describes how to adjust the protection level to meet your organization's requirements. 

## Adjust protection level  
You can adjust User Account Control settings in the Control Panel.  

1. Go to **Start** and open **Control Panel**.
2. Select **System and Security**.
3. Under **Security and Maintenance**, select **Change User Account Control settings**.
3. Move the slider to one of the following levels: 
   * **Notify me only when apps try to make changes to my computer (default)**
   * **Always notify**  
4. Select **OK** to save your changes. 
5. Select **Yes** when prompted to confirm the changes.  

## Check access in Company Portal    
After you make changes to User Account Control, return to Company Portal and run a check on your device to register the changes with the app.  

1. Open Company Portal for Windows.
2. Go to **Devices** and select your device.  
3. Select **Check access**.
