# How to enable User Access Control

Your work or school wants to ensure that devices accessing their resources are secured. One way they've chosen to make sure that your device is set up to access those resources is to keep unauthorized software from being installed on your device.

Here's how you can change the settings for User Access Control:

1. Go to **Start** and open **Control Panel**.
2. Open **Security and Maintenance** > **Change User Account Control settings**.
3. On the **Choose when to be notified about changes to your computer** page, move the slider to one of the top two notches closest to **Always notify**.

Still need help? Contact your company support. For contact information, see the [Company Portal website](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2010980).
