# Submit errors to the right people for your managed macOS device

Sometimes unexplained errors occur in the Company Portal app. When an error occurs, you can email the details of it to your company's support person. These details will provide the context needed to troubleshoot the problem for you.

## Send errors to your company support

To send details about an error in the Company Portal app:

- On the error message you receive, click **Report**.

- Click the **Help** menu > **Save Diagnostic Report**. Choose a location to save the file. Then email or upload this file to your company's support person.

- If your email app is configured, you can send the diagnostic report by going to **Help** > **Send Diagnostic Report**. After the logs are uploaded, click **Email details**.

## Send errors to the Company Portal developers for macOS devices

At times, the Company Portal app may close unexpectedly. App developers want to hear from you when unexpected behavior occurs. They use the error details to find the root cause and prevent future occurrences. Such errors are detailed on your device in a special document called a _diagnostic log_. The Company Portal team needs the Company Portal-specific logs to diagnose the problem.

To send logs to Microsoft:

1. Open the Company Portal app.
2. Click the **Help** menu > **Send Diagnostic Report**.  After the logs are uploaded, you'll receive an incident ID. Copy and save the ID.
3. Email Microsoft using <a href="mailto:IntuneCPiOSfeedback@microsoft.com?subject=My Company Portal App Closed Unexpectedly&body=Paste your incident ID and describe the incident here.">this template</a>.

Still need help? Contact your company support. For contact information, check the [Company Portal website](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2010980).
