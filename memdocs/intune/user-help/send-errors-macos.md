# Report Company Portal app problems  

Report a problem or error that occurs in the Intune Company Portal app for macOS. This article describes how to share app diagnostic logs with your support person, and how to send a diagnostic report to Microsoft.    

## Share app diagnostic logs with support person      
Reproduce the problem, if you can, and then complete these steps to share the details of the event with your support person.   
1. In the Company Portal app, go to the menu bar and select the **Help** menu > **Save Diagnostic Report**. 
2. Choose a location to save the file. 
3. Open your email app and attach the diagnostics file to a new email.   
6. In the body of the email, describe the steps you took right up until the error occurred, and describe any messages or behavior you noticed.   
7. Send the email to your support person, and follow up with them after the email if needed.      

## Send diagnostic report to Microsoft    

Microsoft uses the Company Portal-specific diagnostics to learn from and improve upon future products. First, try to reproduce the problem so that you receive the error message again. Then select **Report** to immediately upload and share the diagnostic logs. 

If the error message can't be reproduced, you can access the diagnostics options from the Help menu.   

1. Go to the Company Portal menu bar and select **Help**. 
2. Select **Send diagnostic report**.  

## Contact information  
To find your organization's contact information, sign in to the Company Portal app or [website](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2010980) and select **Support**.
