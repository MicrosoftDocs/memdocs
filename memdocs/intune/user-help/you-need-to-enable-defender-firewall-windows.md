# Turn on your Windows Defender Firewall

Windows Defender Firewall helps prevent hackers and malicious software from gaining access to your PC through the internet or a network. Your organization might require you to turn it on before you can access their network resources from your device. 

To turn on Windows Defender Firewall:

1. Go to **Start** and open **Control Panel**.
2. Select **System and Security** > **Windows Defender Firewall**.
3. Choose **Turn Windows Firewall on or off**. 
4. Select **Turn on Windows Firewall** for domain, private, and public network settings.
