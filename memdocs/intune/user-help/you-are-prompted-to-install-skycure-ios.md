# Install Symantec Endpoint Protection Mobile on your iOS device

Before you can access your work, your company needs you to install the Symantec Endpoint Protection (SEP) Mobile app, which helps to protect your device by finding potential security threats. You might see different prompts on your device, depending on how your company set up SEP Mobile.

## What you need to do

1. If you see the following prompt, tap **Install** to allow SEP Mobile to be installed on your device.

2. When you see the following message, tap **Settings**, turn on **Location Services**, and then tap **Continue**.

3. Review the permissions that SEP Mobile needs, and tap **Continue**.

4. At the prompt asking you to allow SEP Mobile to send you notifications, tap **Allow**.

5. SEP Mobile finishes installing and shows you the welcome screen.

6. Once you've completed setup, you see the following screen if no security threats are found on your device.

If SEP Mobile finds a security threat on your device, you will see instructions on how to fix the issue.

## If the installation doesn't work

Sometimes installations can fail due to technical issues beyond your control. If this happens, try installing SEP Mobile [manually from the App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/app/sep-mobile/id695620821).
