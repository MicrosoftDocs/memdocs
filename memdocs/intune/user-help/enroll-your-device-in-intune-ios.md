> [!NOTE]
> If you tried to access your work email in the Mail app, and received a prompt to get your device managed, you're in the right place. Follow the instructions in this article to regain access to your email and other work resources on your iOS device.  

## Before you begin    

[Install the Intune Company Portal app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/intune-company-portal/id719171358) from the Apple App Store. The Company Portal app is used to enroll and manage your device, install work apps, and get IT support.  The app supports devices running iOS 14.0 and later.  

You also need the Safari web browser on your device.  

## Enroll device  

Maintain a Wi-Fi connection until all steps are complete. Pausing for more than a few minutes during enrollment might cause the Company Portal app to close or end setup. If this happens, reopen the app and try again.  

1. Open the Company Portal app on your personal device and sign in with your work or school account.  

2. When prompted to receive Company Portal notifications, tap **Allow.** Company Portal uses notifications to alert you of things you need to do to make your device more secure and maintain work access.  

3. On the **Set up access** screen, select **Begin.**

4. Select your device and enrollment type.  

    ![Example screenshot of Company Portal, "Select device and enrollment type" screen, device type options.](./media/enroll-your-device-in-intune-ios/ios-device-type-1909.PNG)  

   Your options:  

    * Tap **(Organization) owns this device** if you received your device from your organization. Then skip to [Secure entire device](#secure-entire-device) in this article to finish setup.  
    * Tap **I own this device** if you're using a personal device that you brought from home. Then continue to the next step.  

    If you don't see this screen, skip to [Secure entire device](#secure-entire-device).  


6. Choose how to protect the data on your device once it's enrolled.  

    ![Example screenshot of Company Portal, "Select device and enrollment type" screen, enrollment type options.](./media/enroll-your-device-in-intune-ios/ios-enrollment-type-1909.PNG)  

    Your options:  

    * Tap **Secure entire device** to secure all apps and data on the device. Then go to [Secure entire device](enroll-your-device-in-intune-ios.md#secure-entire-device) to finish setup.
    * Tap **Secure work-related apps and data only** to secure only the apps and data you access with your work account. Then go to [Secure work-related apps and data](enroll-your-device-in-intune-ios.md#secure-work-related-apps-and-data).  

### Secure entire device  

1. On the **Device management and privacy** screen, read through the list of device information your organization can and can't see. Then tap **Continue**.  


 > [!IMPORTANT]
> These next steps and screens will differ depending on your iOS version. Follow the steps for your iOS version. 

2. Safari opens the Company Portal website on your device. When prompted to download the configuration profile, tap **Allow**. If you're on a device running:  
    * iOS 12.2 and later: When the download is complete, tap **Close**. Then continue to step 3.  
    * iOS 12.1 and earlier: When the download is complete, you are automatically redirected to the Settings app. Skip to step 4.  
 
    If you accidentally tap **Ignore**, refresh the page. You'll be prompted to open the Company Portal app. Once you're there, tap **Download again**.

  > [!NOTE]
  > You must install the management profile as described in the next steps within 8 minutes of downloading it. If you don't, the profile will be removed and you'll have to restart enrollment.  

3. When prompted to open Company Portal, tap **Open**. Read through the information on the **How to install Management Profile** screen.  

4. Go to the Settings app and tap **Enroll in < organization name >** or **Profile Downloaded**.  

    ![Example screenshot of the Settings app, Enroll in organization option.](./media/enroll-your-device-in-intune-ios/enroll-in-organization-ios-1909.PNG)  

   If neither options appear, go to **General** and select the VPN & device management option to view installed profiles. If you still don't see the profile, try downloading it again. 

5. Tap **Install**.  
    
6. Enter your device password. Then tap **Install**.    

7. The next screen is a standard system warning about device management. To continue with installation, tap **Install**. If you're prompted to trust remote management, tap **Trust**.  

8. After installation is complete, tap **Done**. To verify that the profile was installed, go to your VPN and device management settings. You should see the profile listed under **Mobile Device Management**.   

9. Return to the Company Portal app. Company Portal will begin to sync and set up your device. Company Portal might prompt you to update additional device settings. If it does, tap **Continue**.  

10. You'll know that setup is complete when all items in the list show a green checkmark. Tap **Done**.   

> [!Note]
> If your organization monitors voice and data limits, or provides you with a company-owned device, you might have a few more steps to complete. If your organization is part of Apple's Device Enrollment Program, find out [how to enroll your company-owned device](enroll-your-device-dep-ios.md).  

### Secure work-related apps and data  
1. The **Download Microsoft Authenticator** screen appears (if you already have Authenticator, you won't see this screen so skip to step 2).  
    1. Tap **Download from App Store**.
    2. When the App Store opens, install the app. 
    3. Return to Company Portal and tap **Continue**.    
    
   After you install Microsoft Authenticator, you won't need to do anything else with the app. It just needs to be present on your device. 

   ![Example screenshot of Company Portal, "Download Microsoft Authenticator" screen.](./media/enroll-your-device-in-intune-ios/download-ms-authenticator-1909.PNG)

8. On the **Sign in** screen, enter the password for your managed Apple ID. In most cases, these credentials will be the same ones you use to sign in to your work or school account, unless your organization provided you with a different set of credentials. 
9. Tap **Sign in**.  
10. A success message will appear on the screen briefly after the profile is installed. To verify that the profile was installed, go to your VPN and device management settings. You should see the profile listed under **Mobile Device Management**.
