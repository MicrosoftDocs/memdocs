# Get a recovery key for a macOS device

Use the Company Portal website to get a recovery key for your locked macOS device. If you forget your device password, you can sign in to the Company Portal from another device to retrieve your key.  

## Get recovery key from Company Portal website

This option is available for devices that were encrypted by your organization using FileVault. It's not available for devices that you've personally encrypted.

1. On any device, sign in to the [Company Portal website](https://portal.manage.microsoft.com) and select the **Menu** button > **Devices**.  
2. Select the encrypted macOS device.  
3. Select **Get recovery key**.

    For security reasons, the key will disappear after five minutes. To see the key again, select **Get recovery key**.

If a key isn't found but your device is properly encrypted, contact your organization's support person. For contact information, check the [Company Portal website](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2010980).
