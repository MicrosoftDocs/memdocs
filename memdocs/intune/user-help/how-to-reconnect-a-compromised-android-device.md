# How to reconnect a compromised Android device

Your company support detected that you are using a rooted device. "Rooted" means that the device has been changed to enable access to the operating system, which can compromise security and might be a threat to your company resources. When this happens, your device can no longer access company resources.

Still need help? Contact your company support (check the [Company Portal website](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2010980) for contact information), or write the <a href="mailto:wintunedroidfbk@microsoft.com?subject=I'm having trouble with a rooted device&body=Describe the issue you're experiencing here.">Microsoft Android team</a>.
