# How to reconnect a compromised iOS device

Your company support detected that you are using a jailbroken device. "Jailbroken" means that the device has been changed to enable unrestricted access to certain critical files, which can compromise security and might be a threat to your company resources. 

When this happens, your device can no longer access company resources and you likely will need to reset your device to factory settings. We recommend that you contact your company support for help. For contact information, check the [Company Portal website](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2010980).
