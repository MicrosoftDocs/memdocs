# How to set the amount of time before your device is locked

To keep the data on your Android device more secure, your company support can set a policy that requires you to set the amount of time that your device can be idle before it is automatically locked. Follow these steps to set the amount of time before your device will be locked.

1. In **Settings** on your device, click **Security** &gt; **Automatically Lock** (this appears as **Lock phone after** on some devices).

2. Specify the password timeout value.

Still need help? Contact your company support. For contact information, check the [Company Portal website](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2010980).
