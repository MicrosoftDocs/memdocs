# Turn on Windows Defender to access company resources

Your work or school wants to ensure that devices accessing their resources are secured. There are a few ways that they can use [Windows Defender](https://www.microsoft.com/safety/pc-security/windows-defender.aspx), Windows' built-in protection for malicious software.

There are a few settings you may need to change on your Windows Defender to fix any access issues. These steps may require you to go to a couple of different places on your computer.

## Turn on Windows Defender

1. In **Start**, open **Control Panel**.
2. Open **Administrative Tools** > **Edit group policy**. This will open the **Local Group Policy Editor** in a new window.
3. Open **Computer Configuration** > **Administrative Templates** > **Windows Components** > **Windows Defender Antivirus**. The setting **Turn off Windows Defender Antivirus** is underneath the folders of other settings. 
4. Open **Turn off Windows Defender Antivirus** and make sure it's set to **Disabled** or **Not configured**.

## Turn on Real-time Protection

Check to make sure that Real-time Protection is turned on by going to **Start** and searching for **Windows Defender Security Center**. Select **Virus and threat protection settings** and confirm that both **Real-time protection** and **Cloud-delivered protection** are switched to **On**. If these options aren't appearing, do the following to enable them:

1. In **Start**, open **Control Panel**.
2. Open **Administrative Tools** > **Edit group policy**. This will open the **Local Group Policy Editor** in a new window.
3. Open **Computer Configuration** > **Administrative Templates** > **Windows Components** > **Windows Defender Security Center** > **Virus and threat protection**.
4. Open the setting **Virus and threat protection area** and set it to **Disabled**.

## Update your antivirus definitions

Check to make sure that your antivirus definitions are up-to-date by going to **Start** and searching for **Windows Defender Security Center**. Select **Protection updates** and **Check for updates** to make sure that your device has current protection against viruses. If this option doesn't appear, follow the steps in [Turn on Real-time Protection](turn-on-defender-windows.md#turn-on-real-time-protection)
