# Performing actions on a macOS device managed by Jamf

Your company uses a combination of tools to make sure that your macOS device can access company resources safely. To make sure that your device can access these resources, you need to go to **Applications** > **Self Service**, and make sure that your device is compliant with company policies or to perform any other actions on your device.

If you are on the macOS device with the compliance issues that is managed by Jamf, click the **Resolve** button to launch **Self Service**.

__What to do if you see "AccountNotOnboarded" or "Device is already enrolled"__

If you've opened the Company Portal app and a message appears that says, "AccountNotOnboarded," you need to quit the Company Portal app, and go to **Applications** > **Self Service**. Your company will have a device registration policy that you need to install. Click on the policy to install it, then open the Company Portal again.
