# Enroll your Android device in telecom expense management

Your organization may be using telecom expense management software to ensure that their data and voice plans are being used within acceptable limits. Once you have completed enrolling your device, you will then be prompted to select the best category for that device.

Select the appropriate option, and you will receive a notification to install the [__Datalert__](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=fr.memobox.databox) app from the Google Play Store. The Datalert app is how your organization can measure data usage. If your organization has configured the work or school enrollment option, you will be required to log in with your work or school account. If this hasn't been enabled, you will need to provide information such as your phone number and verify your device using a code to enroll into the Datalert service from the app.

Tap the __next__ arrow at the top right corner of the screen to proceed. Your company support should tell you whether you'll sign in with your __Microsoft work or school account__ or to use your __phone number__.

## Enroll into Datalert using your Microsoft work or school account

1. Select __Enroll with Microsoft account__.

2. Choose your work or school account from the available accounts. If your account is not listed, you can sign in to it using the **Add account** button.

   ![A screenshot of the "Pick account" screen, showing a sample account and the Add account button.](./media/and-enroll-12b-tem-datalert-enroll-select-msft-account.png)

3. Datalert setup will work for a few moments, then should complete. Tap __Finish__ when it completes.

## Enroll into Datalert using your phone number

1. Provide your device's phone number.

3. Once you've provided the verification code, Datalert setup will complete. Tap __Finish__ and you will be able to monitor your data from the Datalert app.
