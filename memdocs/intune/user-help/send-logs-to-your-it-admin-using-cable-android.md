# Upload and email logs using a USB cable

Email company support about a problem you experienced in the Company Portal app. Error details are recorded and stored on your device in a special document called a _diagnostic log_. This article describes how to upload the logs from your device to your computer. You'll need a USB cable to complete these steps.
