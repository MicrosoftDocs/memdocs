# What happens if you unenroll your Windows device from Intune?

Use the links at the right side of this page, under **In this article**, to find information about the type of device you're using.


## Windows 10, Windows 8.1, Windows 8, Windows 7, Windows Vista

- Your device doesn't appear in the Company Portal anymore, and you can’t install apps from the Company Portal anymore.

- If you installed the Intune client software, it’s removed from your computer.

- The Intune Endpoint Protection software is removed from your computer. If your computer has other virus protection software installed and it is disabled, that software can be re-enabled after Intune Endpoint Protection is removed. Check your computer after removing it from the Company Portal.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > If the other virus protection software is not re-enabled or no other virus protection software is installed, your computer may be vulnerable to viruses and malware.

- Any settings that were changed on your device when you added it (for example, disabling the camera) no longer apply.

- Your computer no longer receives automatic software updates or antivirus software updates from the Intune service. But, depending on how it is set up, your computer might still receive updates from the Windows Server Update Services, Windows Update, or Microsoft Update.

In addition, for Windows 8.1:

- You can’t use company apps and company data on your device anymore.

- Some email apps, like Windows Mail, can’t access company email that is stored on your device anymore.

- You might not be able to connect to your company network by using Wi-Fi or a virtual private network.

- You might not have access to some company resources, like file shares or internal websites, on your device anymore.

## Windows 10 mobile and Windows Phone 8.1

- The Company Portal app is uninstalled from your device. This means that your device doesn’t appear in the Company Portal anymore, and you can't install apps from the Company Portal app or the Company Portal website.

- You can’t use company apps and company data on your device anymore.

- Any settings that were changed on your device when you added it (for example, disabling the camera or requiring a certain password length) no longer apply.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > The only exception to this is encryption policies, which still apply. If your company policy required you to encrypt your Windows Phone, the only way to unencrypt your phone is to reset it by using the **Settings** menu.
