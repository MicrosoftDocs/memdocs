# What information can my organization see when I enroll my device?  

**Applies to**: 
- Windows 10
- Windows 11
- Android
- iOS/iPadOS
- macOS
- Linux 

Your organization can't see your personal information when you enroll a device in Microsoft Intune. Enrolling your device makes certain information, such as device model and serial number, visible to IT administrators and support people with administrator access. 

* Support person: This is the person or department at your organization that you're supposed to contact if you're having problems with your device. They provide technical support for device setup, enrollment, and access.  
* IT administrator: *IT admin* for short, this person or team of people configure the Microsoft Intune device management and enrollment settings for your organization. Some IT admins also provide technical support.

This article describes everything your organization can and can't access on an enrolled device, and explains why certain data is made visible. To view the ownership type for an enrolled device, sign in to the Intune Company Portal app or website and go to **Device Details**.  

## Things your organization can never see

Your organization can't see:  

- Calling and web browsing history
- Email and text messages
- Contacts
- Calendar
- Passwords
- Pictures, including what's in the photos app or camera roll
- Content of user created documents 

## Things your organization can always see  

Your organization can always see:  

- Device owner
- Device name
- Device serial number
- Device model, such as *Google Pixel*
- Device manufacturer, such as *Microsoft*
- Operating system and version, such as *iOS 12.0.1*
- Device IMEI  

## Things your organization might see  

Your organization can see and access certain aspects of your device when assisting with or troubleshooting device setup. This section describes the type of information available.   

### Phone number  
Your organization can see the full phone number of all corporate-owned devices, except for Android devices with a work profile, which only show the last four digits. They can see the last four digits of a personal device's phone number.   

### Device storage space   
If you have trouble installing a required app, your support person may look at your storage size to find out if low space is the cause.   

### Location 

Your organization can view the location of a lost corporate-owned device. They can't view the location of a personal device. 

If necessary, your organization can put a missing, corporate-owned iPhone or iPad into *managed lost mode*. This mode lets them request the location of the device. When someone requests access to the device location, the device locks and a message appears on the lock screen to explain what's happening. For information about *supervision*, which is another type of configuration for corporate-owned Apple devices, see [Get started with a supervised iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=853816) in the Apple support docs. 

### App inventory details

On corporate-owned Android devices that have a work profile, your organization can only see the apps installed in the work profile. For all other corporate-owned devices, they see all installed apps. 

On personal devices, your organization can see the managed app inventory, which includes work and school apps. Some configurations enable organizations to see more than just the managed app inventory on a personal device. To learn more about the information your organization collects, contact your IT admin.    

>[!NOTE]
> An app is considered a *managed app* when it's installed in one of the following ways:
> * You install it from the Company Portal app after your organization makes it available to you. 
> * Your organization requires you to have a certain app for work and school and automatically installs it on the device upon enrollment.  

### App permissions  
*Applies to devices running Android 11 and earlier*  

An IT admin can grant permission to apps in the work profile, both manually and by automation. The IT admin does this to reduce the number of prompts you receive. The permissions could be for things like the camera, microphone, and location. If your device is running Android 11, you'll receive a push notification when someone grants permission to an app.  

###  Network information
Some information about network connections for Android devices may be available to your organization. For example, if your organization requires devices to remain within a certain building, your device would identify the network where it's connected.    

### Additional device details

Your organization can query these details about a corporate-owned Windows device.  

 - Hardware and operating system environment information  

 - Installed certificate details  

 - File paths and file names  

 - Operating system user and group information  

 - Registry and event log entries  

 - Details about running processes
