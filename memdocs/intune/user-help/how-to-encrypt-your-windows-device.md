# How to encrypt your Windows device

To protect your company or school data, your company support might require you to encrypt your Windows device. If you have a Windows Phone, and you have enrolled it, your device will be encrypted automatically if encryption is required.

If you have a desktop device, follow the instructions below to encrypt it.

1. Search for, and then start, the **Manage BitLocker** app.

2. Click **Turn on BitLocker**, and then follow the instructions shown to encrypt each of your drives.

Still need help? Contact your company support. For contact information, check the [Company Portal website](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2010980).
