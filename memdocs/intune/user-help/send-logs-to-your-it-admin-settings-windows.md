# Report a device problem for Windows           

*Applies to*  
- *Windows 10*  
- *Windows 11*  

Export and share management log diagnostics with your support person to troubleshoot an error on your enrolled device. When an error or event occurs on your device, the details of it are recorded and saved to a document called a _diagnostic log_. Diagnostic logs can provide your support team with enough information to diagnose and resolve the error.  

To share logs with your support person:   

1. Open the **Settings** app on your device.  
2. Go to **Accounts** > **Access work or school**.  
3. Select **Export your management log files**.  

   ![The "Access work or school screen", which presents the Export option underneath the "Related settings" heading.](./media/send-logs-to-your-it-admin-settings-windows/w10-export-logs.png)

4. Email the logs to your support person. Logs are saved in **C:\Users\Public\Public Documents\MDMDiagnostics**. Two files are created for each log: one is the log itself, and the other is a document that allows your admin to review the logs in different programs, such as Microsoft Excel. Include both files in your email to your support person. 

You can also [send Company Portal app logs](send-logs-to-your-it-admin-cp-windows.md) to your support person. 

Still need help? Contact your support person. For contact information, sign in to the [Company Portal website](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2010980).
