# Turn on verbose logging in Microsoft Intune app  

**Applies to Microsoft Intune app for Android**  

Logging enables the Microsoft Intune app to record actions that take place in the app. If you ever experience a problem in the app, and then report it, your support team can review these logs for more insight into the problem. *Verbose* logging, which is the highest level of logging, is most helpful for troubleshooting because it provides the most details about what happened in the app. 

The logging detail level defaults to **Important** in the Microsoft Intune app. To adjust the level:  

1. Open the Microsoft Intune app.  
2. Tap **Settings**.  
3. Under **Log level detail**, select **Verbose** to increase the level of details recorded, or select **Off** to turn off logging.  

> [!NOTE]
> The logs sent to your IT support team include your email address.
