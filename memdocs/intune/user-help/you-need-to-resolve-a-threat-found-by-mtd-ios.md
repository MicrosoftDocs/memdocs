# Resolving a threat found by a Mobile Threat Defense app

A Mobile Threat Defense (MTD) app detects and alerts you to potential threats on your device, such as suspicious apps, networks, or OS vulnerabilities. The Company Portal app notifies you when a threat is detected and lets you know if it affects your access to school or work resources. It then redirects you to the MTD app for details about the threat and, if available, steps to fix it. 

If a threat appears to be too risky, as determined by your organization, your access to school or work resources can be revoked. As long as these threats are present on your device, you may be unable to:  

* Connect to corporate e-mail
* Connect to corporate Wi-Fi
* Connect to SharePoint Online
* Sync corporate files with OneDrive
* Access company apps

There are a variety of MTD vendor apps that you could have, all with different names. Below are just a few iOS-specific apps that you could have. Select an app to see how it works with Company Portal to alert you to threats. For more guidance, follow the Company Portal and MTD app's onscreen instructions or contact your IT support person.
