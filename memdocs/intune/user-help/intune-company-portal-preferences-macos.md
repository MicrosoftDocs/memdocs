# Manage Company Portal preferences for macOS 

Select your preferences for single sign-on and in-app data collection in Company Portal. To access your preferences:  

1. Open the Company Portal app.
2. Go to the menu bar and select **Company Portal** > **Preferences**.  

## Single sign-on   

The single sign-on extension configures your work or school account so that you only have to authenticate once to access all apps and services within your organization's network. To opt out of SSO on your macOS device, clear the checkbox next to **Don't ask me to sign in with single sign-on for this device**. 


## Send usage data to Microsoft    

This setting enables Microsoft to collect data about your Intune Company Portal usage. When the checkbox is selected, your in-app performance and usage data is automatically anonymized and shared with Microsoft to help improve the reliability and performance of our products. Your organization doesn't have control over the collection of this data and cannot change your preference.  

To turn off data collection in Company Portal, clear the checkbox next to **Allow Microsoft to collect usage data**.  

## Enable or disable advanced logging

The **Enable Advanced Logging** setting is available in the Intune Company Portal app for macOS devices. Device users can able to enable or disable advanced logging on a device. By turning on advanced logging, detailed log reports will be sent to Microsoft to troubleshoot issues. By default, the **Enable Advanced Logging** setting will be off. Device users should keep this setting off unless otherwise instructed by their organization's IT admin.

To modify this setting on an macOS device:
1. Open the Company Portal app.
2. Go to the menu bar and select **Company Portal** > **Preferences**. 
3. Under **Advanced logging**, modify the checkbox next to **Turn on advanced logging**.
