# Sync your Windows device manually

When app installation speed is less than ideal, initiate a manual device sync. Manual syncs force your device to connect with Intune for the latest updates and communications. Installation speed may increase after the device sync is complete.

Intune supports manual sync from the Company Portal app, desktop taskbar or Start menu, and from the device Settings app. Company Portal app functionality is supported on Windows 10 devices running the Creator's Update (1703) or later. 

All Windows devices can be synced from the device Settings app, including:

* [Windows 10 desktop](#windows-10-desktop)  
* [Microsoft HoloLens](#microsoft-hololens)   
* [Windows 10 Mobile](#windows-10-mobile)  
* [Windows Phone 8.1](#windows-phone-81)    

## Sync directly from Company Portal app for Windows
Complete these steps to manually sync any Windows 10 device running Creator's Update (version 1709) or later.

1. Open the Company Portal app on your device.

2. Select **Settings** > **Sync**.

## Sync from device taskbar or Start menu   

You can also access the sync control outside of the app, from your device's desktop. This way is useful if you have the app pinned directly to your taskbar or Start menu, and want to quickly sync.  

1. Find the Company Portal app icon in your taskbar or Start menu.  
2. Right-click the app's icon so its menu (also referred to as a jump list) appears.

3. Select **Sync this device**. The Company Portal app opens to the **Settings** page and initiates your sync.  

## Sync from Settings App 
Complete these steps to manually sync your Microsoft HoloLens, Windows 10 desktop, Windows 10 Mobile, or Windows Phone 8.1 devices from the Settings app.
