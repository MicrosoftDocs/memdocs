# Sync your Windows device manually

 A manual sync forces your device to connect with Intune to get the latest updates, requirements, and communications from your organization. Company Portal regularly syncs devices as long as you have a Wi-Fi connection. However, if you ever need to disconnect for an extended period of time, the sync feature ensures that you can get any updates you missed when you return.   
 
Syncing can also help resolve work-related downloads or other processes that are in progress or stalled. If you're experiencing slow or unusual behavior while installing or using a work app, try syncing your device to see if an update or requirement is missing.  

Intune supports manual sync from the Company Portal app, desktop taskbar or Start menu, and from the device Settings app. Company Portal app functionality is supported on Windows 10 devices running the Creator's Update (1703) or later. 

All Windows devices can be synced from the device Settings app, including:

* [Windows 10 desktop](#windows-10-desktop)  
* [Microsoft HoloLens](#microsoft-hololens)   

## Sync from Company Portal app for Windows
Complete these steps to manually sync any Windows 10 device running Creator's Update (version 1709) or later.

1. Open the Company Portal app on your device.

2. Select **Settings** > **Sync**.

## Sync from device taskbar or Start menu   

You can also access the sync control outside of the app, from your device's desktop. This way is useful if you have the app pinned directly to your taskbar or Start menu, and want to quickly sync.  

1. Find the Company Portal app icon in your taskbar or Start menu.  
2. Right-click the app's icon so its menu (also referred to as a jump list) appears.

3. Select **Sync this device**. The Company Portal app opens to the **Settings** page and initiates your sync.  

## Sync from Settings app 
Complete these steps to manually sync your Microsoft HoloLens and Windows 10 desktop devices from the Settings app.  

### Windows 10 desktop  
1. On your device, select **Start** > **Settings**.

2. Select **Accounts**.
