# Send errors to your company support for issues with your iOS device
Sometimes you may experience an error while you're using the Company Portal app on your iOS device. When this occurs, you can email details about the error to your company's support person. These details will provide the context needed to troubleshoot the problem for you.

When you upload the logs in the Company Portal app, they're first sent to the Microsoft developers that work on the app. They use the logs to improve the app's functionality and prevent future errors. An incident ID for your specific error is then provided to you to share with your company support person, for use in Microsoft Support cases.

If you get errors on your iOS device while using the Company Portal app, you can send information to help your company support troubleshoot the problem. You can send error information in different ways:

- On error alert messages, tap **Report**.

- In the **More** tab of the Company Portal app, tap **Get Help**.

- In the Company Portal app, shake your device, then tap **Send Diagnostic Report** when the diagnostics alert appears. If the alert doesn't appear when you shake the device, open **Settings** > **Company Portal**, and make sure that the **Shake Gesture** option is on.

Still need help? Contact your company support. For contact information, check the [Company Portal website](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2010980).
