# Encrypting your Android device

Device encryption protects your files and folders from unauthorized access if your device is lost or stolen. It makes the data on your device inaccessible and unreadable to people without a passcode. 

Before you can access school or work resources, your organization might require you to:

* [Encrypt your device](#encrypt-device)
* [Enable secure startup](#enable-secure-startup)
* [Set startup passcode, PIN, or other authentication method](#set-startup-passcode)  

> [!Note]
> Certain Android devices from Huawei, Vivo, and OPPO can't be encrypted. For more information, see [Device encrypted but app says otherwise](your-device-appears-encrypted-but-cp-says-otherwise-android.md).  

## Encrypt device

Follow these steps to encrypt your device. Your device may restart several times. 

The name and location of the encryption option will vary depending on your device manufacturer and Android version. 

1. Open the **Settings** app.
2. Type **security** or **encrypt** in the app's search bar to find related settings.
3. Tap the option to encrypt your device. Follow the onscreen instructions.  
4. When prompted, set a lock screen password, PIN, or other authentication method (if allowed by your organization). 
5. To recheck settings, open the Company Portal or Microsoft Intune app.
    * Company Portal users: Select your device and tap **Check device settings**. 
    * Microsoft Intune users: You'll have to wait until the page updates, but when it does, your encryption status should change to compliant. 

## Enable secure startup

Your organization may require you to enable secure startup as part of their encryption policy. This feature further protects your device by requiring a password or PIN to be entered before the phone starts up. You many have additional authentication options but it will vary depending on what your organization allows. 

The name and location of the secure startup option will vary depending on your device manufacturer and Android version. On some devices, this setting may be called **Strong protection**. 

1. Open the **Settings** app.
2. Type **secure startup** in the app's search bar.
3. Tap **Secure startup** > **Require PIN when device turns on**.
4. When prompted, enter your device PIN.   
5. To recheck settings, open the Company Portal or Microsoft Intune app.
    * Company Portal users: Select your device and tap **Check device settings**. 
    * Microsoft Intune users: You'll have to wait until the page updates, but when it does, your encryption status should change to compliant.  


## Set startup passcode   
When you [encrypt your device](#encrypt-device) and [enable secure startup](#enable-secure-startup), you'll be prompted to set your device PIN, password, or other authentication method (if allowed by your organization). No further steps are needed. 

To choose or change the lock screen type:

1. Open the **Settings** app.
2. Type **screen lock** in the app's search bar.
3. Tap **Screen lock type**.
4. Tap the screen lock type you want to use and follow the onscreen instructions to confirm.  

## Troubleshoot    
**Issue**: The encryption button is disabled.   

**Thing to try**: 
* Make sure your device is fully charged and plugged in. Encryption may take a while and requires a full battery.   

**Issue**: You see a message saying that you still need to encrypt your device.  

**Things to try**:
   *  [Set a lock screen](#set-startup-passcode) on your device. 
   * [Enable secure startup](#enable-secure-startup).
