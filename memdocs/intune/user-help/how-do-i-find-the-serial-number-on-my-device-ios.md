# Compliance and setting requirements for Apple devices          

**Applies to:**  
* iOS/iPadOS
* macOS  

Learn more about the policies the Intune Company Portal app enforces on iPhones, iPads, and Macs used for work or school.    

## Reconnect compromised iOS device

A *jailbroken* device is a device that has been altered to enable unrestricted access to certain critical files. Jailbroken devices can compromise security and cause a threat to work or school data. If Company Portal detects a jailbroken device, it revokes access to work or school resources. You likely need to reset your device to factory settings to return your device to its original configuration. We recommend that you contact your IT support person for help and other possible options.   

## Device limit reached  

To prevent unauthorized access to internal data, your school or workplace might limit the number of devices you can register. If you reach the device limit, we recommend removing one of your devices or contacting your support person to increase the device limit. Your options:  

* Remove a device in Company Portal.
* Contact your IT support person and ask if they can increase the number of devices you're allowed to register.  

## Identify device  

If you're prompted to identify your device during enrollment, at least one of your devices has already been enrolled and assigned to your account using a method other than the Company Portal app. Select your device from the list in Company Portal to identify your device. 

If your device isn't listed:  
1. Select **new device**.  
2. Select **Continue**.
3. Enter the last four characters of your device's serial number. For more information, see [Find the serial number of your Apple product](https://support.apple.com/en-us/102858) on Apple Support.  

Need additional help? Contact your IT support person. For contact information, check the Company Portal app or [Company Portal website](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2010980).
