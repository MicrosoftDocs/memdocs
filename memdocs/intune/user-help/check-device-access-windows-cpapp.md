# Check access from Company Portal app for Windows

Verify that your device has access to work or school resources. 

Organizations enforce requirements&ndash;such as encryption and password limits&ndash; to make sure only secure, trusted devices access their data. Managed devices must meet and maintain these requirements to access the organization's resources.

The **Check access** action evaluates your device's settings and its access status. The **Device details** page lists the settings you need to adjust to regain access. 

Complete the steps in this article to check access from the Company Portal app for Windows.  

## Check access from Device details page  
1. Open the Company Portal app for Windows and go to **My Devices**.

2. Select a device.  
3. On the **Device details** page, select **Check access**. The app syncs your device with your organization's current requirements and checks to make sure your device matches them. This check can take a few minutes.
