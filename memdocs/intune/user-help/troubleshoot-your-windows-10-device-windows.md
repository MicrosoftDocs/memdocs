# Troubleshoot your Windows 10 device enrollment
If you've enrolled your device, but still can't access your work or school email and files, try these troubleshooting steps.  

1. Look at the next two screens, and find the one that looks like what you see on your device. Follow the steps that go with the screen you see on your device.

    If you see this screen, follow the steps in [Troubleshooting steps to follow if you see Access work or school](#troubleshooting-steps-to-follow-if-you-see-access-work-or-school).

    If you see this screen, follow the steps in [Troubleshooting steps to follow if you see Your account](#troubleshooting-steps-to-follow-if-you-see-your-account).

## Troubleshooting steps to follow if you see "Access work or school"

1. If you followed the steps above, but you still can't access your work or school email and files, go back to **Access work or school**.

2. Do one of the following:

   - If you see a connection that looks similar to the image below, tap it, and then check that you see the Manage, Info and Disconnect options. If you see these options, you're now enrolled and connected.

   - If you don't see the connection information shown above, or you do see it, but it's missing some of the options, tap **Connect**. Then sign in with your work or school credentials to connect.  

## Troubleshooting steps to follow if you see "Your account"

If you followed the steps above, but still can't access your work or school email, files, and other data, go back to **Accounts**, and tap **Work access**.

- If you see your work or school account listed, you're connected.  

- If you don't see your work or school account, tap **Connect**, and then sign in with your work or school credentials.

## Troubleshooting steps to follow if you see "Set up a work or school account"

If you see a message that says <strong>We couldn't auto-discover a management endpoint matching the username entered. Please check your username and try again. If you know the URL to your management endpoint, please enter it.</strong>, then you should try to re-enter your username and password. If it still doesn't work, you should check with your company support for the website that you need to provide in the <strong>Management endpoint</strong> text box. This is a website that probably looks like <strong>www.yourcompany.onmicrosoft.com</strong>.

Still need help? Contact your company support. For contact information, check the [Company Portal website](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2010980).
