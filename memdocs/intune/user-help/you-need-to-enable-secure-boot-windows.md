# You need to enable Secure Boot

Your organization requires that you enable Windows Secure Boot, which is a security feature that helps to protect your device.

Enabling Secure Boot is an advanced task. If you are using a mobile device, contact your company support for help.

If you are using a PC, you can contact your company support, or see the section "To re-enable Secure Boot" on the [Disabling Secure Boot](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/dn898540(v=vs.85).aspx) page to try enabling Secure Boot yourself.

Still need help? Contact your company support. For contact information, check the [Company Portal website](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2010980).
