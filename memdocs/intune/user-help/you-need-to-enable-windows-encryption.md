# You need to enable encryption

When you encrypt a device, you are wrapping the information on it in a layer of protective code that prevents unauthorized people from accessing it. As a step towards making sure your information is secured, your organization is requiring you to you enable BitLocker.

BitLocker is software that encrypts your drive and helps to protect your data. Follow [these instructions](https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/How-to-turn-on-BitLocker-34294d3d) on how to enable BitLocker on Windows 10 devices.
