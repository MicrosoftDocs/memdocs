Email your organization about any problems you experience in Company Portal. Select **Get Help** to start describing the problem. Your organization will use the information you provide to troubleshoot the problem. If more help is needed to determine the problem, your organization will use the diagnostic ID in the email to reach out to Microsoft's support team.  

For the step-by-step procedure, see [Send logs to your company support from the Company Portal app for Windows 10/11](send-logs-to-your-it-admin-cp-windows.md).
