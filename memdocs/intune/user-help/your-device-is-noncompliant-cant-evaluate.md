# Your device is noncompliant

Your device is noncompliant with at least one of your organization's security policies, but the error can't be displayed right now.  

In the Company Portal app, tap **Check Compliance**. The Company Portal app will then tell you what is causing your device to be noncompliant.

Still need help? Contact your company support. For contact information, check the [Company Portal website](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2010980).
