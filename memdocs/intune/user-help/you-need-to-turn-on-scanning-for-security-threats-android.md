Some apps contain harmful behavior and can compromise the data on your device. To prevent these types of apps from harming your device, we recommend that you: 

* Only download apps from verified sources, such as the Google Play Store.  
* Turn on Google Play Protect. Play Protect checks the apps on your device and alerts you to security threats.

2. Tap **Google Play Protect**.
3. Tap **Turn on**.
