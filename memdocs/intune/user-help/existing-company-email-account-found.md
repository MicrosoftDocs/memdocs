# Remove existing email account 

**Applies to iOS/iPadOS**  

If you set up your work email on your device prior to device enrollment, your organization might require you to remove the account and resync it. 

## Step 1: Disconnect account  

Disconnect the email account that's linked to your work account. For steps, see [Add and remove email accounts on iPhone](https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/add-and-remove-email-accounts-iph44d1ae58a/ios) (opens Apple Support).  

## Step 2: 
After you disconnect the account, sync your device in the Intune Company Portal app.  

1. Open the Company Portal app on your device.  
2. Select your device.  
3. Select **Check settings**. Wait while your device syncs your new email settings.
4. Sign in to your email with your work account.
