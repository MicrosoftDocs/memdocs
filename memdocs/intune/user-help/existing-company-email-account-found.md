# An existing email account was found

If you set up your work email on your device prior to enrollment, your organization may require you to remove it. 

Doing this allows your organization to set you up with an email profile that meets their network and security requirements. After you disconnect, you'll just need to sync your device and you'll regain access to your email. 

Complete the following steps on your device to disconnect the existing account and update device settings. If you don't complete these steps, you may lose or have limited mobile access to your work account. Instructions are for devices running iOS/iPadOS 14 and later. Labels and setting names may be different for devices running on earlier versions.  

1. Go to **Settings** > **Mail** > **Accounts** to  find your connected accounts. 
 
2. Select and remove the account that you've linked to your work email. 

3. Open the Company Portal app on your device.  

4. Under your list of devices, select the device you want to update.

5. Select **Check settings**. Within a few moments, your device will sync your new email settings.

6. Sign in to your email account.
