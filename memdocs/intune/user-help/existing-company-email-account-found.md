# An existing company email account was found

You might have had mobile device access to your work or school email account *before* you got your device managed. If your device is now managed, we recommend that you:

* Disconnect the existing work email account from your device.
* Resync device settings from the Company Portal app.  

These steps will ensure that your device meets your company's security requirements, and that your emails remain secure.

1. On your device, go to **Settings** and find your connected accounts. On an iOS 11+ device, for example, select **Password & Accounts**.
 
2. Select and remove your work email account.

3. Open the Company Portal app on your device.  

4. Under your list of devices, select the device you want to update.

5. Select **Check settings**. Within a few moments, your device will sync your new email settings.

6. Sign in to your work or school email account.
