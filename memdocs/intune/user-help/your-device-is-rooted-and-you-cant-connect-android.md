# Your Android device is rooted, so you can't connect

You've been directed here because you've seen a message telling you that your device has been _rooted_.

If an Android device has been "rooted," it means that some part of the device's software has been changed to enable capabilities that might not otherwise be present. These modifications can often compromise secure access to organizational resources, such as email and documents. Rooted devices are therefore prevented from being used to access these resources until the problem is fixed.  

There are a couple of common ways that your device could have become rooted:

- You might have installed an app on your device that the root detection software thinks is a security risk. If you see this message immediately after you install an app, try uninstalling that app.

- Your device manufacturer installed software on your device that the root detection software thinks is a security risk. In this case, you need to contact your company support for help. For contact information, head to the [Company Portal website](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2010980).

If you have rooted your device yourself, you will need to reverse the process and restore the device back to its unrooted state.
