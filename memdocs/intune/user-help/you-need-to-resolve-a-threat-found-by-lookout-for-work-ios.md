# Resolve a threat found by Lookout for Work on iOS

The Lookout for Work app is a Mobile Threat Defender service that identifies potential threats on your iOS device. These threats are reported to the Company Portal app, and appear there as unresolved, noncompliant issues. As long as these threats are present, you may be unable to:

* Connect to corporate e-mail
* Connect to corporate Wi-Fi
* Connect to SharePoint Online
* Sync corporate files with OneDrive
* Access company apps

This article describes how to recognize Lookout for Work threat alerts and what to do to resolve them. 

## Troubleshoot virus or security threat  
Regain access to your company's resources when the Lookout for Work app detects a security or app threat.  

1. If a virus or security threat is detected, you'll receive a message like the one shown in the screenshot below. Tap the **device management portal** link to open the [Company Portal website](https://portal.manage.microsoft.com/devices).

2. Select your device.  
3. Read the warning that appears below your device. It will instruct you to open Lookout for Work to fix the virus or security threat.

Select the app name shown at the top of your screen. Then follow the instructions to remove and uninstall the app. As long as the app is on your device, you'll be unable to access company resources.
