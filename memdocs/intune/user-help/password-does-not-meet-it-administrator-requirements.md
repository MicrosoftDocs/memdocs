# Device password requirements  

You'll receive a message from Company Portal if your device password doesn't meet your organization's security requirements. Password requirements are put in place to protect you and your org's data from unauthorized access. Until you create a more secure password, you may be blocked from accessing your org's network.  

Company Portal sends one message per password requirement, so you may receive more than one message at a time. This article lists all of the password-related messages you could receive, by OS platform.     

## Change password, passcode, PIN  

The following resources describe how to update the device password, by OS platform. For steps specific to your device, refer to the device manufacturer's website.
