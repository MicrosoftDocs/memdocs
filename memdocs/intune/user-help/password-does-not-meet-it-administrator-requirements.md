# Add or change device passcode on work or school device    

 **Applies to**:  
 * Windows 10  
 * Windows 11  
 * Android  
 * iOS/iPadOS  
 * macOS  

Intune Company Portal notifies you when the sign-in password, PIN, or passcode on your enrolled device conflicts with your organization's security requirements. Device sign-in requirements are put in place to prevent unauthorized individuals from gaining access to the work or school data on your device. Until you choose a more secure sign-in method, you may be blocked from accessing your organization's network.  

Company Portal sends one message per passcode requirement. For example, if your passcode is too short and too simple, you'll receive one message about the length and one message about the complexity. For a list of all passcode-related messages in Company Portal, see [Reference: device passcode messages in Company Portal](intune-company-portal-password-message-reference.md).  

## Change password, passcode, PIN  

To secure your device with a sign-in passcode, password, or lock screen, see the following resources.
