# Add or change device passcode on work or school device    

 **Applies to**:  
 * Windows 10  
 * Windows 11  
 * Android  
 * iOS/iPadOS  
 * macOS  

When you enroll your device for work or school use, you might need to adjust the lock screen and startup settings you use to unlock your device so that they align with your organization's password and biometric requirements. Password and biometric requirements are put in place to prevent unauthorized individuals from gaining access to the work or school data on your device. Until you choose a more secure authentication method for your device's lock screen, you might be blocked from accessing your organization's network.  

## List of Company Portal messages 

For a list of all passcode-related messages in Company Portal, see [Reference: device passcode messages in Company Portal](intune-company-portal-password-message-reference.md). Company Portal sends you one message per password requirement. For example, if your passcode is too short and too simple, you receive one message about the length and one message about the complexity.  Your workplace or school are the ones that choose the password and biometric requirements for your device. If the Company Portal messages appear too vague, contact your IT support person directly for the exact password and biometric requirements for your device.  

## Change password and biometrics   

The following resources are available for Apple, Android, and Windows devices, and describe how to set up lock screens and startup passwords. For the most up-to-date information about how to secure your specific device model, refer to the device manufacturer's help documentation.
