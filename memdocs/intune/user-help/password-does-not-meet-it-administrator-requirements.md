# Add or change device password on Intune-enrolled device    

 **Applies to**:  
 * Windows 10  
 * Windows 11  
 * Android  
 * iOS/iPadOS  
 * macOS  

Intune Company Portal notifies you when the password, PIN, or passcode on your enrolled device conflicts with your organization's security requirements. Password requirements are put in place to prevent unauthorized individuals from gaining access to the work or school data on your device. Until you create a more secure device password, you may be blocked from accessing your org's network.  

Company Portal sends one message per password requirement. For example, if your password is too short and too simple, you'll receive one message about the length and one message about the complexity.    

## Change password, passcode, PIN  

The following resources describe how to secure devices running Windows 10/11, iOS/iPadOS, macOS, and Android.
