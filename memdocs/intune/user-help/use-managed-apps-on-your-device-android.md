# Use managed apps on your Android device
Managed apps are configured to meet your organization's security requirements, and protect work and school data. These apps are made available to you on your device to install or use automatically. 

Before you receive and install a managed app, your organization configures its permissions. They might restrict app functionality or user interactions to protect app data from being shared or seen by unauthorized individuals. For example, an organization could block the use of copy and paste while in the app. Or they could restrict you from saving data to your device's local storage.

To maximize data protection, your organization might configure several managed apps to work together. For example:
1. You connect to your organization's network in a managed browser app, such as Microsoft Edge.
2. You click a link to open your peer's presentation file.
3. An appropriate managed app, such as Microsoft PowerPoint, opens the file.

Organizations can require you to use a managed app to do something, such as open a work file, or access a web link. If you don't have the app, you might not be able to continue your task. Some managed apps are made available for you to install, but are not required.

## How do I know I'm using a managed app?
When you try to access work or school data in a managed app, you'll receive an on-screen message that the app is protected by your organization. 

## Commonly managed apps  
Examples of commonly required or available managed apps within schools and workplaces are:

- Microsoft Edge

- Microsoft Outlook

- Microsoft Word, Excel, and PowerPoint

## How do I get managed apps?
There are three ways to get managed apps.  
* Your organization automatically installs apps to your device at time of enrollment.  
* You install an app from the Google Play store, and then sign in to the app with your work or school account.    
* Your organization makes managed apps available to you in Company Portal. Go to the Company Portal app or website to search, view, and install available apps. For more information about these apps, see the next section, [Available apps](#available-apps).  

### Available apps   
 Your organization can select apps that are appropriate and useful for you at work or school, and make them available to you in Company Portal.  

 Apps are also made available to you based on your device type. For example, if you're using the Company Portal app for Android, you'll have access to Android apps, but not iOS apps.   

## Request an app for work or school   
 If there's an app you need, but don't see in Company Portal, you can request it. Find contact details for your **Helpdesk** in either app's **Contact IT** tab. You'll find the same contact information on the [Company Portal website](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2010980).   

## What can my company support manage in an app?  
The following list describes the settings your company support can manage within an app. These settings affect how you view, access, and otherwise use work or school data on your device:

* Access to specific websites  

* Access to internal company websites using Microsoft Edge and the Azure Active Directory proxy  

* Minimum version of app, version of OS

* Ability to share and transfer data between apps  

* How and where you save files  

* Copy and paste functionality  

* PIN access requirements  

* How you sign in, using company credentials  

* Ability to back up data to the cloud  

* Ability to take screenshots  

* Data encryption requirements  

Contact your company support for more information about the managed apps on your device. For contact information, check the [Company Portal website](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2010980).
