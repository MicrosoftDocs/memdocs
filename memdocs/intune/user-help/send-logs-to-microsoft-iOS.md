# Send iOS app logs to Microsoft developers 

If Company Portal behaves unexpectedly, you can report the problem to Microsoft by uploading app logs. The app logs live on your device and contain details about the unexpected events that occur in apps such as Company Portal. Microsoft uses the Company Portal-specific logs to learn from and improve upon future products. 

> [!Tip]
> To make it easier for your support person and app developers to figure out a problem, turn on _verbose logging_. Verbose logging records all details about an error and includes these details in the report. For more information, see [Configure logging settings](use-verbose-logging-to-help-your-it-administrator-fix-device-issues-android.md). 

## Upload logs    

1. Open the Company Portal app.
2. Try to reproduce the event you experienced. This step is optional but ensures that the Company Portal details appear at the top of the logs when uploaded. 

3. Use one of the following methods to initiate the upload:  
    * When you receive an error message, tap **Report**.   
    * Tap **More** > **Get Help**. 
    * Shake your device. Then tap **Send Diagnostic Report**. 

5. Wait while Company Portal uploads the logs.   

6. Save the incident ID for your records.  


## Next steps  
After you upload the logs, select **Email details** to report the problem to your IT support person. In the body of the email, explain what you experienced and include your incident ID. Your support person may use the incident ID to enlist help about your case from Microsoft.  

Still need help? Contact your IT support person. For contact information, check the [Company Portal website](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2010980).
