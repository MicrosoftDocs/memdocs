# Report a problem in Company Portal for iOS  

*Applies to Intune Company Portal app for iOS/iPadOS* 

Report a problem or error that occurs in the Intune Company Portal app for iOS/iPadOS. This article describes how to share app diagnostic logs with your support person.  

> [!Tip]
> To make it easier for your support person and app developers to figure out a problem, turn on _verbose logging_. Verbose logging records all details about an error and includes these details in the report. For more information, see [Configure logging settings](use-verbose-logging-to-help-your-it-administrator-fix-device-issues-android.md).  

## Access help and support in app    
You can access the reporting feature in Company Portal using any of these methods: 

* When you receive an error message or alert, tap **Report**.  
* Under the **More** tab of the Company Portal app, tap **Send Logs**.  
* In the Company Portal app, shake your device, then tap **Send Diagnostic Report**. If the diagnostics report prompt doesn't appear when you shake the device, open **Settings** > **Company Portal**, and turn on **Shake Gesture**.  

## Share diagnostic logs    

1. Open the Company Portal app for iOS/iPadOS.
2. Try to reproduce the event you experienced. This step is optional but ensures that the Company Portal details appear at the top of the logs when uploaded. 

3. Use one of the following methods to initiate the upload:  
    * When you receive an error message, tap **Report**.   
    * Tap **More** > **Send Logs**. 
    * Shake your device. Then tap **Send Diagnostic Report**. 

5. Wait while Company Portal uploads the logs.   

6. Save the incident ID for your records and to share with your support person. The incident ID is unique to your report.    

7. Select **Email details** to follow up with your support person with more details so they can get started with your case. In the body of the email, explain what you experienced and include your incident ID. Your support person may use the incident ID to enlist help from Microsoft about your case.  

Still need help? Contact your support person. For contact information, check the [Company Portal website](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2010980).
