# Configure logging settings for AOSP

Logging enables the Microsoft Intune app to record actions that take place in the app. If you ever experience a problem in the app, and then report it, your support team will review the app logs. Verbose logging, which is the highest level of logging, is most helpful in these cases because it provides the most details about what happened in the app. 

The log detail level defaults to **Important** in the Microsoft Intune app. To adjust the level:  

1. Open the Microsoft Intune app.  
2. Tap **Settings**.  
3. Under **Log level detail**, select **Verbose** to increase the level of details recorded. Select **Off** to turn off logging.  

> [!NOTE]
> The logs that you send to your support team will include your email address.
