# Reset device in Company Portal app for iOS  

Use the Intune Company Portal app for iOS to reset a used, lost, or stolen work device back to factory settings. After you reset a device, all apps, settings, and personal data on the device are deleted and the device no longer appears in Company Portal.  

If your device is only set up to access work or school email, your email account is deleted. Unsaved emails are also deleted.   

## Availability of factory reset option 

The factory reset option isn't available for all iOS devices. If you're an IT support person and want to find out more about these limitations, see [Remove devices by using wipe, retire, or manually unenrolling the device](/mem/intune/remote-actions/devices-wipe).  

## Factory reset device  
To reset a device to its original, out-of-box settings:   

1. Open the Company Portal app on any enrolled device and sign in with your work or school account.
2. Select **DEVICES**. 
3. Select the device you want to reset.
4. Next to **Rename**, select the ellipses button > **Factory reset**.  
5. Select **Reset** to start wiping the device.   

## Next steps  

* You can also [reset a device from the Company Portal website](reset-device-company-portal-website.md).  

* If you want to unenroll your device from Company Portal so that it's no longer managed by your organization, see [Remove iOS device from Intune](unenroll-your-device-from-intune-ios.md). After you unenroll the device, you might lose access to the work-related content on your device.
