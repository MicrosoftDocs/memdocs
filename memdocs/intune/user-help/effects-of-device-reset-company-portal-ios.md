# Effects of Company Portal iOS device reset 

Resetting your iPhone or iPad through Company Portal might delete some apps and settings, including personal data. This behavior depends on how your device was enrolled or set up in your organization. The following information describes what happens after a device reset.  

If your organization manages your device, and you can access work and school emails, apps, and Wi-Fi:

- Your device won't appear in the Company Portal anymore.  

- Your device will be reset to the manufacturer's factory default settings. Your personal data, apps, and settings will be removed.

If your device is only set up to access work or school email:

- Your device won't appear in the Company Portal anymore.  

- Your work or school email account will be deleted. Unsaved emails will be deleted.   

The device reset option isn't available for all iOS devices. If you're an IT support person and want to find out more about these limitations, see [Remove devices by using wipe, retire, or manually unenrolling the device](https://docs.microsoft.com/intune/devices-wipe).  

If you have questions, contact your IT support person. For contact information, check the [Company Portal website](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2010980).
