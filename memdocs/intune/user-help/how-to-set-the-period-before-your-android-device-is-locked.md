# How to set the amount of time before your Android device locks its screen

To reconnect to your work, you'll need to set the password timeout on your device by following the steps for the type of device you have.

## Native (non-Samsung Knox) device

1. In **Settings** on your device, tap **Security** &gt; **Automatically Lock** (this appears as **Lock phone after** on some devices).

    If **Automatically Lock** (**Lock phone after** on some devices) is not displayed, ensure that you have set a valid password under **Settings** &gt; **Screen Lock** &gt; **Password**.

2. Select the password timeout value.

## Samsung Knox device

    If **Lock automatically Lock** (**Lock phone after** on some devices) is not displayed, ensure that you have set a valid password under **Settings** &gt; **Screen Lock** &gt; **Password**.

2. Select a password timeout value.
