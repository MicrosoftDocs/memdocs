# Install and share apps on your device  

**Applies to**  
- Windows 10  
- Windows 11  

Browse and install available work apps in the Intune Company Portal app for Windows. There are two types of apps you'll see in the Intune Company Portal app.  

* Optional apps: These apps are selected by your organization and deemed useful and appropriate for work or school. They're available to you but it's up to you whether you want to install them. 

* Required apps: These apps are necessary for work and school and are deployed directly to your device. These apps are automatically installed for you without intervention. Required apps appear in your installed apps list alongside the optional apps you install. To find out which apps are required, sign into the Company Portal app and go to **Downloads & updates**. Then look under the column **Required by your organization**.       

This article describes how to install, view, and share work apps in the Company Portal app for Windows.    

## Install apps  
Before you begin, install [Intune Company Portal for Windows from the Microsoft Store](https://www.microsoft.com/p/company-portal/9wzdncrfj3pz?rtc=2&activetab=pivot:overviewtab).    

1. Open the Company Portal app on your work or school device. Then sign in with your work or school account.  
2. You can access available apps from the following places in Company Portal:      

    * **Home**: Go to **Home** to view your organization's featured apps.  
    * **Apps**: Go to **Apps** to view all available apps. You can sort and filter through apps. Search results are sorted automatically by relevancy.  
    * **App categories**: Go to **App categories** to choose apps based on type or function. Apps are sorted into categories picked by your organization, like *featured*, *education*, and *productivity*.  
    * **Search for apps**: A static search bar sits in the app's navigation pane. You can search available apps by name or publisher.  
3. Select an app, and then choose **Install**. 

> [!TIP]
> To select and install more than one app at a time, go to **Apps** and switch the layout view to multi-select mode. Then select the checkbox next to each app you want to install. Choose **Install selected** to install them.  
> [!IMPORTANT]
> The app status changes to **Installed** when installation is done. Select **Retry** if a required app fails to install and the option to retry is available. It could take up to ten minutes for the installation status to update itself.    

## View all apps  
Go to **Apps** to see a list of all available and installed apps on your device. 

* **Name**: The name of the app. 
* **Version**: The version number of the app. 
* **Publisher**: The name of the developer or company that distributed the app. A publisher is typically a software vendor or your organization.  
* **Date Published**: The date that the app was made available to download. Publish date could show an app's initial release or an app's most recent update.
* **Status**: The current installation status of the app on your device, which could include *Available*, *Installing*, *Installed*, and *Install failed*.  

Select **Sort by** to rearrange the apps alphabetically by app or publisher name, or chronologically by publish date. Under **Refine**, you can select a category to narrow results to a certain type of app. 

## View installed apps  
Go to **Downloads & updates** to see a list of installed apps on your device. If no apps are available to view, you'll see a message that no company apps were installed.  

The following information is available for each app:    

* **Name**: The name of the app. 
* **Version**: The version number of the app. 
* **Required by your organization**: How the app is assigned and made available to you.  
* **Publisher**: The name of the developer or company that distributed the app. A publisher is typically a software vendor or your organization.  
* **Status**: The current installation status of the app on your device, which could include *Available*, *Installing*, *Installed*, and *Install failed*. Required apps could take up to 10 minutes to show an up-to-date status. See the note under [Install apps](#install-apps) for important details about installing required apps.  

## Installing Microsoft Office  
Depending on the size of your workplace or school, there could be multiple versions of Office available to install in Company Portal. You should only install one version of Office. If you try to install an additional one, the first one will be uninstalled. If you're unsure which version is best for your role, contact your IT support person for guidance.

1. In Company Portal, right-click or press and hold the app to open the [context menu](/windows/uwp/design/controls-and-patterns/menus).  
2. Select **Share**.  
3. Select a single contact or select another program, such as OneNote, to share the app link with a group of people. The recipient receives a link and a message to view the app. The link opens the Company Portal app details page.
