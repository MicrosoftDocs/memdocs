# Check compliance on your iOS device  
Use the *check status* action in the Intune Company Portal app for iOS to:  

* Update your device settings status.   
* Regain access to work or school resources.   

Company Portal checks in with enrolled devices regularly to make sure device settings meet workplace requirements. If a device doesn't meet the requirements, Company Portal marks it as *noncompliant*. Noncompliant devices can be restricted from accessing workplace resources. 

If your device is noncompliant or blocked from accessing workplace resources, change the settings on the device to align with your organization's requirements, and then initiate a status check in Company Portal.   

1. Open the Company Portal app for iOS on your device.   

2. Go to **Devices**.  
   
3. Select your device.  
   
4. Tap **Check status**. Wait while Company Portal checks your settings. After the check, the device settings status tells you if you have access to workplace resources.  

Still need help? Contact your IT support person. Check for your organization's support details in the [Company Portal website](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2010980) or Company Portal app for iOS.
