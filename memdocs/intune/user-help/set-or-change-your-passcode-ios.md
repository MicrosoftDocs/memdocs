# Set or change your passcode

Create a new passcode or change an existing one to meet your organization's requirements. The passcode will prevent unauthorized people from unlocking and using your device. 

Your organization can set more than one passcode requirement. For a list of common password requirements, see [Device password requirements for enrolled devices](password-does-not-meet-it-administrator-requirements.md).  

If you have trouble creating or changing your passcode, contact your IT support person.  


## Set your passcode

1. Tap **Settings** > **Touch ID & Passcode**.
2. On the **Touch ID & Passcode** menu, tap **Turn Passcode On**.
3. Enter a new passcode that meets your company support's requirements, and then enter it again to verify it.

## Change your passcode

1. Tap **Settings** > **Touch ID & Passcode**.
2. Enter your passcode. The **Touch ID & Passcode** menu opens.
2. Tap **Change Passcode** and enter your old passcode.
3. Enter a new passcode that meets your company support's requirements, and then enter it again to verify it.
