# Resolve a threat found by Harmony Mobile Protect on iOS

Harmony Mobile Protect is a mobile threat defense service that identifies and assesses potential threats on mobile devices used for work or school. The Harmony Mobile Protect app for iOS works with the Intune Company Portal app to keep work devices free of viruses and threats. While threats are present, you may be restricted from using your device for work, and unable to:  

* Connect to corporate e-mail 
* Connect to corporate Wi-Fi
* Connect to SharePoint Online
* Sync corporate files with OneDrive
* Access company app

This article describes how to recognize alerts about detected threats, and what to do to resolve them.  

## Troubleshoot virus or security threat  
When Harmony Mobile Protect detects a virus or security threat on a work or school device, it acts according to your organization's mobile device management (MDM) policies. To maintain work access on the device, immediately investigate push notifications and Company Portal alerts about detected threats. Tap or open threat notifications and follow the onscreen instructions to resolve them in the Harmony Mobile Protect app.

## Troubleshoot an app threat  

If you continue to use a work or school device with an app threat, your device will lose access to work or school resources. To resolve the threat and regain access, go to the Harmony Mobile Protect app. Select the app from the list of threats, and then follow the onscreen instructions to uninstall the app.  

Still need help? Check in with your IT support person. You can find their contact information on the [Company Portal website](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2010980) or in the Intune Company Portal app.
