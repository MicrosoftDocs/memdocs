# Report a problem in Company Portal for Windows      
*Applies to Intune Company Portal for Windows* 

Report a problem or error that occurs in the Intune Company Portal app for Windows. This article describes how to share app diagnostic logs with your support person. 

> [!NOTE]
> App logs are also shared with Microsoft Support in case the problem requires additional help. Your support person will reach out to Microsoft Support with your incident ID to work with them.    

## How to report problem 
Complete the following steps to report a problem you're experiencing in-app or during device enrollment. 

1. Open the **Company Portal** app.
2. Select **Help & support** > **Get help**.  
   
   > [!Note]	  
   > After you click **Get help**, the Company Portal automatically sends your logs to Microsoft's support team. This step is a proactive one that makes it easier to troubleshoot and resolve problems that are escalated to Microsoft support. 

3. When prompted to choose a program, select the Mail app or another preferred email app.   
   
4. The email app will open an email template for you to fill in. Describe the problem and the steps you took leading up to the problem. Then send the email to your support person so that they can follow up on the issue.     

5. Follow up with your support person as needed.  

## What is a diagnostic log?

Events and errors that occur in the Company Portal app are saved on your device in a special document called a _diagnostic log_. Logs can reveal:  
* When the problem happened.  
* The steps leading up to the problem.  
* The state of the app when the problem appeared.   

## Next steps  

* If your company needs additional information about app or device activity, you might need to resend [logs from the Settings app](send-logs-to-your-it-admin-settings-windows.md). 

* Still need help? Contact your support person. For contact information, check the [Company Portal website](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2010980).
