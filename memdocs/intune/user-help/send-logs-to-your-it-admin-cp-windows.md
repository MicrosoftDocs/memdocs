# Email your company support about problem from Company Portal for Windows

Troubleshoot your app problems in the Company Portal app for Windows 10. If you run into a problem while on your Windows 10 device, you can email your support team for help. 

When you request help, a prepopulated email opens where you can describe the problem in detail. It also includes a diagnostic log ID. If your support team can't resolve the problem based on your description, they'll contact Microsoft for help. Microsoft will need the diagnostic ID to reference the app's logs.   


> [!Note]
> After you click **Get help**, the Company Portal will automatically send your logs to Microsoft's support team. This step is a proactive one that makes it easier to troubleshoot and resolve problems that are escalated to Microsoft support. As mentioned above, Microsoft's support team can pull up logs using the diagnostic ID in your email.  

## What is a diagnostic log?

Events and errors that occur in the Company Portal app are saved on your device in a special document called a _diagnostic log_. Logs can reveal:  
* When a problem happened.  
* The steps leading up to the problem.  
* The state of the app when the problem appeared.   

## Steps to get help  

1. Open the **Company Portal** app.
2. Select **Help & support** > **Get help**.

3. When the **Share** screen appears, select **Mail**. The **Mail** app will create an email message for you. Type in a description of the problem you experienced so that the support team has an idea of what to look for.

If your company needs additional information about app or device activity, you might need to send [logs from the Settings app](send-logs-to-your-it-admin-settings-windows.md).  

Still need help? Contact your company support. For contact information, check the [Company Portal website](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2010980).
