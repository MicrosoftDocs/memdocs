# Set your PIN or password

Your company support might require you to set a PIN or password on your Android device when you're using Intune to access your work or school data. You might also see messages that require you to make your PIN or password longer or more complex so that it's more secure. These passcodes are used, for example, to access your device from the lock screen.

You can use the following steps to set a PIN or password.

1. Tap  **Settings** > **Security** > **Screen Lock** > **Password**.

2. Choose and confirm your new password.

For certain devices, you may need to set a startup PIN in addition to your screen password. You can try to fix this issue by finding a location in your settings app to enable this option. For example, on the Samsung Galaxy S7, you enable Secure Startup by going to **Settings** > **Lock Screen and Security** > **Secure Startup**. You can find out more [here](your-device-appears-encrypted-but-cp-says-otherwise-android.md).
