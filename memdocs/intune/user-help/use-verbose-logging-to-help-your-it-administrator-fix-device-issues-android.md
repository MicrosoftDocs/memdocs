# Turn on verbose logging in Company Portal app    

Configure your logging settings to let the Intune Company Portal app record app actions. If you ever experience a problem in the app, and then report it, your support team can review these logs for more insight into the problem. *Verbose* logging, which is the highest level of logging, is most helpful for troubleshooting because it provides the most details about what happened in the app. 

## Configure logging 
Verbose logging records every action you take in the Company Portal app. It's enabled on your device by default. To turn verbose logging off in Company Portal:  

1. Sign in to the Company Portal app.
2. Tap **Settings**.
3. Next to **Verbose Logging**, flip the switch to **Off**.  

> [!NOTE]
> The logs sent to your support team include your email address.
