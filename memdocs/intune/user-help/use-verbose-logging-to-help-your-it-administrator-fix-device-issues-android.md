# Configure logging settings

Configure your logging settings to let the Company Portal app, Microsoft Intune app, and Intune-managed apps record app actions. If you ever experience a problem in the app, and then report it, your support team will review these logs for more details. 

> [!NOTE]
> The logs that you send to your support team will include your email address.  

## Configure Company Portal logging
Verbose logging records every action you take in the Company Portal app. It's enabled on your device by default. To turn verbose logging off in Company Portal:  

1. Sign in to the Company Portal app.
2. Tap **Settings**.
3. Next to **Verbose Logging**, flip the switch to **Off**.

## Configure Microsoft Intune app logging
In the Microsoft Intune app, you can configure the level of log details. The level defaults to **Important**. To adjust logging detail:  

1. Open the Microsoft Intune app.  
2. Tap **Settings**.  
3. Under **Log level detail**, select **Verbose** to increase the level of details recorded, or select **Off** to turn off logging.
