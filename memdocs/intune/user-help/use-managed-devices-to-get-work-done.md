# What is device enrollment?
To get access to work or school resources from your device, you'll need to enroll your device with the Intune Company Portal app or Microsoft Intune app. 

During device enrollment:

* Your device is registered with your organization. This step ensures that you're authorized to access your organization's email, apps, and Wi-Fi. 
* Your organization's device management policies are applied to your device. Policies could include requirements for things like device passwords and encryption. The purpose of these requirements is to keep your device and your organization's data secure from unauthorized access.

Once you update your device settings to meet your organization's requirements, enrollment is complete. You can securely sign in to your work or school account from virtually anywhere.  

This article describes other aspects of enrollment, such as how to get the apps, supported devices, and removing or resetting your device.  

## Company Portal and Microsoft Intune app

The Company Portal and the Microsoft Intune apps alert you to policy or setting changes, so you can take action without losing access to work or school. 

The Company Portal app keeps your personal and work information separate, so you can remain productive and focused. It also makes work and school apps available to you, so you can find and install ones that are relevant to your line of work.  

### Get Company Portal

In some cases, your organization will install the Company Portal app on your device for you. The app is also available to install from app stores such as the Microsoft Store, App Store, and Google Play store. To access the app from a web browser, sign in to the [Company Portal website](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2010980) with your work or school account.  

### Get Microsoft Intune app

If you're required to use the Microsoft Intune app, your organization will install it on your device for you.  

## What's the difference between the apps and the website?
The Company Portal app is available for Windows 10, iOS, macOS, and Android devices. It integrates seamlessly with your device's respective platform. The website version is accessible from any device and gives you the same, universal experience no matter what device you're using. 

The Microsoft Intune app is for corporate-owned Android devices and doesn't have a website.  

## What kind of devices can you enroll with Company Portal?
You can enroll the following devices with Company Portal:  

- Windows devices
  - Windows 10 Mobile
  - Windows 10 Desktop
  - Windows Phone 8.1
  - Windows 8.1
- Apple devices
    - iOS
    - macOS
- Android devices


## What kind of devices can you enroll with the Microsoft Intune app?  
You can enroll corporate-owned Android devices that your organization has set up to use with the app. The app supports Android 6.0 and later. 

## Can you remove a device from the Company Portal?
You can remove or reset a device from the Company Portal. There is a difference between **remove** and **reset**.

During device removal, the Company Portal unenrolls and unregisters the device. That device loses access to the Company Portal. Work or school data might also be removed. 

During a device reset, the Company Portal tries to reset your computer or device back to the manufacturer’s default settings. All work or school data and all personal data is removed from the device. A reset is useful if, for example, you lose your device. You can reset it remotely from the Company Portal website.  

## Can you remove a device from the Microsoft Intune app?
No, there's no way for you to remove a corporate-owned device from the Microsoft Intune app.  

## What if I can't see my device in the Company Portal or Microsoft Intune app?
To see a device in Company Portal, it must first be enrolled. If after enrollment you still don't see all of your devices, try to sync or check access through the Company Portal. You won’t see devices that are owned and managed by your company.

In the Microsoft Intune app, you only see the device you're currently using. Other enrolled devices will not be visible to you in the app.

Contact information is also available on your org's [Company Portal website](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2010980).
