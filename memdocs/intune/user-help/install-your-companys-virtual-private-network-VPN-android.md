# How to install your company's Virtual Private Network (VPN)

If your company support has configured a VPN application to enable you to  connect to your company's resources, you'll see a notification on your Android device indicating that you need to install a VPN app. Follow these steps to install the VPN app:

1. Pull down the notification drawer, and tap **Tap to install this required app**.

2. In the **Play Store**, click **INSTALL** and follow the prompts to install the app.

3. Tap **Install corporate VPN profile** and follow the prompts. The installation steps may be slightly different, depending on which VPN provider your company is using.
