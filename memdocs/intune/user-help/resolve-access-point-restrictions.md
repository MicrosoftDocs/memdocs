# Resolve access point restrictions

Organizations may restrict the locations from which devices access corporate data.
To configure these *access point restrictions*, they specify and set approved
network locations.  

When you try to connect to an unrecognized or unapproved network, you may receive one or more of the following messages:

* Access point restrictions are not set up.
* You are not connected to an approved network.
* An error occurred and the access point restrictions couldn't be enforced.

 The tables below list each message, what it means, and how to access your work resources again.

## Access point restrictions not set up  
| Company Portal message | What this message means | What you should do                                                               
|------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|
| **Access point restrictions are not set up – Access point restrictions are active and must be set up.** | Your company applied access point restrictions on your device. This setting requires the Company Portal app to verify a few network settings on your device. | Tap **Resolve.** The Company Portal app will check to make sure you are connected to a company-approved network. |

## Not connected to an approved network  

| Company Portal message | What this message means | What you should do                                                                   
|------------------------|-----------------------------------|--------------------------|
| **Device is not connected to an approved network – Connect to an approved wireless network.** | You're connected to a network that is not approved for work access. As long as you are connected to this network, you will be unable to access work email, apps, and other protected corporate resources. | Connect to a company-approved network. Then tap **Resolve** to retry. |

## Restrictions couldn't be enforced  

| Company Portal message | What this message means | What you should do                                                                      
|------------------------|-----------------------------------|--------------------------|
| **Access point restrictions could not be enforced – Company Portal encountered an error.** | Intune cannot determine if you are connected to an approved network. This error could be a result of poor network connectivity, low battery, battery saver mode, or a Company Portal error. | Verify that you have a strong network reception. Turn off battery saver mode and make sure your battery life has at least 30% remaining. Then tap **Resolve** to retry.
