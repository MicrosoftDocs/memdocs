# What happens if you reset your Windows device using the Company Portal?

When you use the Company Portal app or [Company Portal website](reset-erase-your-device-cpwebsite.md) to reset your Windows device, it resets your device to its factory settings, and deletes all apps, settings, and data, including your personal data. What happens on each device depends on the type of device that you have and how you're using the device (as described in the following table). For instructions on how to reset your lost or stolen device, see [Reset (erase) your lost or stolen device](reset-erase-your-device-cpwebsite.md).

|Device configuration and management|Device type|
|---------------------------------------|---------------|
|Your company support manages your mobile device|**Windows 10 and Windows Phone 8.1**</br>Your device won't appear in the company portal anymore, and the company portal tries to reset the device back to the manufacturer's default settings. Your personal data, apps, and settings will be removed. <br /><br />**Windows 10 Mobile**</br>The only way to unenroll your device is to reset it.|
|Your device can access company email only|**Windows Phone 8.1**<br />Your device won't appear in the company portal anymore, and your company email account and unsaved email will be deleted.<br /><br />**Windows 7 or Windows Vista**<br />You cannot reset a computer that's running Windows 7 or earlier that's used for email only.<br /><br />**Windows 8.1 and Windows 8**<br />Your device won't appear in the company portal anymore, and your company email account and unsaved email will be deleted.|
|PCs and laptops|**Windows 8.1 and Windows 8**<br />You cannot reset a computer that's running Windows 8 or Windows 8.1 unless it's used for email only.<br /><br />**Windows 7 or Windows Vista**<br />You cannot reset a computer that's running Windows 7 or earlier.|
