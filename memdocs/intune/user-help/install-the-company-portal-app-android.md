# Install the Company Portal app for Android

The Company Portal is an app that gives you access to your company or school apps, email, and Internet connections. This app helps you keep both your organization's information safe by keeping your device secure - for example, by keeping company apps up-to-date, or making sure your device locks itself after a certain amount of time. To learn more about the features of Company Portal and its part in device management, see [Why enroll your Android device](why-enroll-android-device.md).  

1. Tap **Home** > **Play Store**.

2. In the **Search** box, type **Intune company portal**.  

3. Tap **Intune Company Portal**.

5. Tap **ACCEPT**.

After you download the Company Portal app, you'll likely want to [enroll your device in Intune](enroll-device-android-company-portal.md) to get full access to your work information. You can also [sign in using another device](https://docs.microsoft.com/mem/intune/user-help/sign-in-to-the-company-portal#sign-in-from-another-device).
