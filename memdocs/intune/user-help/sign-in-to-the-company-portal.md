# Sign in to Company Portal  

There are three ways to sign in to the Company Portal app:

* Sign in with your work email address and password.  
* Sign in with certificate-based authentication.  
* Sign in from another device.    


## Sign in with your email address and password
The following steps show screenshots from the Company Portal for iOS.  

1. Open the app on your device and tap **Sign In**.

2. Enter your **Work or school account** and tap **Next**.

3. Enter your password and tap **Sign In**.

   ![The user is prompted for their password after their email address has been accepted.](./media/cp_ios_aad_signin_after_1804_003.png)

4. The app will verify your credentials. When done, you can access your organization's resources and install available apps.

## Sign in with certificate-based authentication
You'll only see this sign-in option if your organization allows certificate-based authentication and you have a certificate available to use.  

1. Open the Company Portal app on your device.  

2. Enter your **Work or school account**.  

3. Tap the **Sign in with a certificate** link.  

4. Tap **Continue** to use the certificate.  

## Sign in from another device

If your company uses smartcards to access your computers, it's likely that you have to authenticate by signing in from another device.  

1. Open the Company Portal app on your device. Make sure it's the device you'll be using to access your work resources.       

1. Select **Sign in from another device**.  

   ![The Company Portal sign-in page prompts user for email address.  Shows the "Next" button and a link to "Sign in from another device." Also includes a link to "Can't access your account?"

2. You receive a unique, one-time code to sign in to the Company Portal. Copy the code.

   ![Instructions are provided to go to the https://microsoft.com/devicelogin page, with a unique passcode, from your work computer, then to use the code to sign in.](./media/cp_ios_aad_signin_after_1804_006.png)

3. On your other device (the one you're using to authenticate), open your browser and go to [https://microsoft.com/devicelogin](https://microsoft.com/devicelogin). Enter or paste the code.

4. Select  __Continue__ to allow the Company Portal to sign in on your work device.   

   ![The user has input their unique code into the field, and the "Device login" site has asked for confirmation that the Intune Company Portal was the correct app to receive authorization to sign in.](../fundamentals/media/whats-new-app-ui/cp_ios_aad_signin_from_another_device_after_1704_005.png) 

5. Once the code is verified, you can close the window.  

   ![A confirmation page that states that the user has now signed into the Company Portal app on their device, and that this page can be closed.](../fundamentals/media/whats-new-app-ui/cp_ios_aad_signin_from_another_device_after_1704_006.png)

6. The Company Portal app signs you in on your work device.
