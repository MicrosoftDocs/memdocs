# Company Portal device setting requirements for Android  

This article describes the Android device setting requirements that Intune Company Portal can enforce on behalf of your workplace or school. Requirements are determined by your organization, and help keep your device secure while you're using it for work or school purposes. You only need to update settings flagged by Company Portal.  

## Device limit reached  
To prevent unauthorized access to internal data, your school or workplace might limit the number of devices you can register. If you reach the device limit, we recommend removing one of your devices or contacting your support person to increase the device limit. Your options:  

* Remove a device in Company Portal.  

* Contact your IT support person and ask if they can increase the number of devices you're allowed to register.  

## Install Android security patch 
 _Security patches_ are released periodically to fix or maintain software, and ensure the device runs smoothly. For information about how to install the latest patch on your device, see [Check & update your Android version](https://support.google.com/android/answer/7680439) (opens Android Help) or contact your device manufacturer.  

## Install Virtual Private Network (VPN)  
Tap the Company Portal notification to install your organization's preferred VPN app on your device. Google Play Store opens the store listing for the VPN app. After you install the app, tap **Install corporate VPN profile** and follow the onscreen prompts to set up your work VPN.  

## Missing certificate  
If your device isn't enrolled in Intune, and it's missing a required certificate, you can't sign in to the Company Portal app. To resolve this issue, enable browser access in the Company Portal app.    

1. In the Company Portal app, go to the right-hand corner and select the menu.  

2. Select **Settings**.  

3. Next to **Enable Browser Access**, select **Enable**.  

4. On the Device Administrator screen, select **ACTIVATE**.  


## Operating system isn't supported  
The operating system (OS) version on your device isn't supported. It's possible the latest version doesn't work with your organization's apps, tools, and other internal infrastructure. To resolve this issue, contact your IT support person and find out what the OS requirements are for your device.   

## Rooted device detected  
*Rooting* a device involves changing its software. These changes make the device more prone to unauthorized access and malicious attacks, which is why rooted devices are often blocked from accessing company emails or files. Your organization might block your device from accessing work or school resources if:  

* You install an app on your device that the root detection software thinks is a security risk. For example, if you're prompted to unroot your device immediately after you install an app, uninstall the app and then check to see if you regain access.

* Your device manufacturer installed software on your device that the root detection software thinks is a security risk. Contact your IT support person for help. For contact information, sign in to the Company Portal website or Company Portal app.  

* You rooted the device. Reverse the root (commonly done with PC software or apps) and restore the device back to its previous state. Make sure to back up your device before you begin.  

## Set screen lock on device    
Set up secure lock on your device to prevent others from accessing it when it's idle. Secure lock works by automatically locking the device after the screen turns off. If you already have a screen lock enabled, you might need to adjust the auto lock time on your device to meet work requirements. You can configure secure lock to happen immediately after the screen turns off or after a set amount of time.   

For more information about how to access the secure lock settings on your device, see [Set screen lock on an Android device](https://support.google.com/android/answer/9079129) (opens Android Help) or contact your device manufacturer.  

## Turn off USB debugging mode  
_USB debugging_ is often used by developers or IT support people to connect and transfer data from an Android device to a computer. While this feature is useful, a device isn't as secure when connected to a computer. For information about how to access developer options, see [Enable USB debugging on your device](https://developer.android.com/studio/debug/dev-options#Enable-debugging) (opens Android Studio). After you turn off USB debugging, wait a few minutes for the change to register before you try accessing work resources again.   

## Turn on Google Play Protect  
Some apps contain harmful behavior and can compromise the data on your device. To prevent these types of apps from harming your device, we recommend that you:  

* Only download apps from verified sources, such as the Google Play Store.  

* Turn on Google Play Protect. Play Protect checks the apps on your device and alerts you to security threats. For how-to steps, see [Use Google Play Protect to help keep your apps safe & your data private](https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/2812853) (opens Google Play Help).       

## Update operating system version  
Keeping your device up-to-date lets you access the newest features, and it also ensures that your device has the most secure version of its operating system. While using the device for work or school, we recommend keeping both personal and corporate devices up-to-date with the newest versions. Before updating your device, back up all of the information on it. Keeping a backup can help you recover your data if something should interrupt any updates, or lets you transfer your information to a replacement device. 

For information about how to install the latest software updates, see [Check & update your Android version](https://support.google.com/android/answer/7680439) (opens Android Help) or contact your device manufacturer.
