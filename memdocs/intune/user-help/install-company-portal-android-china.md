# Install Company Portal app in People's Republic of China

Install the Intune Company Portal app to access school or work resources from your Android device. The app is available in the People's Republic of China and can be installed from the following app stores: 

* [Google Play](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=871947) (not available everywhere)
* [Lenovo](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2125082)
* Huawei
* OPPO 
<!--* [Xiaomi](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=836947)-->

Company Portal is also available from the [Baidu App Store](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2133565). To find it:  
 
   1. Go to the [Baidu App Store](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2133565).  
   2. Search for the Company Portal app by entering **公司门户** in the search bar.  
   3. Select the Company Portal ![Company Portal icon](./media/company-portal-logo-small-2101.png) listing.  


If the app stores listed above are unavailable, you can download [Microsoft Intune Company Portal for Android](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=49140) on your device and side-load the app. When installed this way, the app doesn't receive updates or fixes automatically. You must be sure to regularly update and patch the app manually.  

## Next steps  
After you install the app on your device, follow your organization's instructions to set up your device for school or work. For enrollment help, see [Enroll Android device with Intune Company Portal](enroll-device-android-company-portal.md). 

> [!Note]
> Google Mobile Services (GMS) and Android Enterprise are not available in China. In countries/regions where GMS is not available, use device administrator to enroll devices in Intune. For more information, see [Managing Android devices where Google Mobile Services are not available](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/intune-customer-success/intune-customer-success-managing-android-devices-where-google/ba-p/1628793).
