# Reset device from Company Portal website

**Applies to**:     
* iOS/iPadOS    
* Windows 10
* Windows 11

Remotely reset a used, lost, or stolen device to factory default settings. A *reset* deletes all apps, settings, and personal data on the device, unenrolls the device, and removes it from the Company Portal apps and website.  

## Supported devices  

You can reset the following types of devices from the Company Portal website: 

* iOS/iPadOS devices that aren't supervised   
* Devices running Windows 10 or Windows 11  

The action may not be available on devices that your organization owns and lends out for use. If you're an IT support person and want to find out more about device reset and its limitations, see [Remove devices by using wipe, retire, or manually unenrolling the device](../remote-actions/devices-wipe.md).

1. On any device, sign in to [the Company Portal website](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2010980) with your work or school account. 
1. Select the menu > **Devices**.  
1. Select the device you want to reset.
