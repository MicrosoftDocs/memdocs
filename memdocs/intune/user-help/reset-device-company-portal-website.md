# Reset device from Company Portal website

Use the Company Portal website to reset a used, lost, or stolen device back to factory settings. All apps, settings, and personal data on the device will be deleted and the device will no longer appear in Company Portal.  

Device reset isn't available for all iOS devices. Your organization can also choose to hide the option. If you're an IT support person and want to find out more about device reset and its limitations, see [Remove devices by using wipe, retire, or manually unenrolling the device](../remote-actions/devices-wipe.md).  

## Reset device  
To reset a device to its original, out-of-box settings: 

1. Open the Company Portal website and select the __Menu__ button > __Devices__.  

2. Select the device you want to reset.

3. Select **Reset**. If the reset option isn't visible at the top of your page, select **More (…)** > **Reset**.
