# How to turn off Microsoft data collection

Microsoft automatically collects certain data about our products and services. We do this to improve the reliability and performance of our products, including the Company Portal app. Even though this data is anonymized, some users may not feel comfortable with this collection. Your company support does not have control over the collection of this data, and they cannot change your selection for the setting.

If you wish to turn off the collection of usage data on your iOS device, open **Settings**, tap **Company Portal**, and then turn off **Usage Data**. For macOS devices, open the **Company Portal** menu > **Preferences**, then uncheck **Allow Microsoft to collect usage data**.

Still need help? Contact your company support. For contact information, check the [Company Portal website](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2010980).
