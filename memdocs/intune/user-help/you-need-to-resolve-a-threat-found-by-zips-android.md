# Resolve a threat found by Zimperium zIPS on Android

Zimperium zIPS is a Mobile Threat Defender service that identifies potential threats on your Android devices. These threats are reported to the Company Portal app, and appear as unresolved, noncompliant issues. If your device is identified as being noncompliant, you may be unable to:

* Connect to corporate e-mail
* Connect to corporate Wi-Fi
* Connect to SharePoint Online
* Sync corporate files with OneDrive
* Access company apps

This article describes how to recognize Zimperium zIPS threat alerts and what to do to resolve them. 

## Troubleshoot virus or security threat  
When a virus or security threat is detected, Zimperium zIPS will enforce restrictions according to your organization's access policies. You company's access policies could prevent you from accessing your work's network, apps, and email from your device.  

Zimperium zIPS will prompt you to take action to regain the access you've lost. Select the threat and follow the instructions within the app to resolve it.

Because the app is integrated with your company's MDM provider, you'll also see a warning about restricted access in the Company portal app. The warning instructs you to open Zimperium zIPS to fix the virus or security threat.

Select the warning banner that appears below the affected device. Zimperium zIPS will open and tell you how to eliminate the threat.  

## Resolve an app threat

If you install an app that's seen as a threat to your device, you'll receive a notification within Zimperium zIPS. If the affected app remains on your device, you'll be unable to access company resources.  

To resolve, select the app from the list of threats in Zimperium zIPS. Then follow the on-screen instructions to remove and uninstall the app.
