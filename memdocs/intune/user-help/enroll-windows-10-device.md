## Sync device to fix connection problems  

After enrolling, if you have trouble accessing work or school things, try syncing your device. For more information about syncing, see [Sync device](sync-your-device-manually-windows.md).     

## Enroll Windows 10, version 1511 and earlier device  
Enroll devices running Windows 10, version 1511 and earlier. Company Portal doesn't support these versions, so setup is done in the Settings app.  

1. Go to **Start** and open the **Settings** app. 

3. Select **Accounts** > **Your account**.
