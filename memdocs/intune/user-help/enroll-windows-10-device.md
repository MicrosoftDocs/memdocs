## Get Company Portal
You can enroll Windows 10/11 devices through the Intune Company Portal website or app. Devices running Windows 7 or 8.1 must enroll through the Company Portal website. To access Company Portal:

* [Sign on to the Company Portal website](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2010980) with your work or school credentials.  

## Enroll Windows 10, version 1607 and later device

## Sync device to fix connection problems  

After enrolling, if you have trouble accessing work or school things, try syncing your device. For more information about syncing, see [Sync your Windows device manually](sync-your-device-manually-windows.md).     

## Enroll Windows 10, version 1511 and earlier device  
Enroll devices running Windows 10, version 1511 and earlier. Company Portal doesn't support these versions, so setup is done in the Settings app.  

1. Go to **Start** and open the **Settings** app. 

3. Select **Accounts** > **Your account**.
