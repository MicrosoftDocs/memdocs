When you unenroll your macOS device from Intune, your device can no longer access company resources.

Follow these steps to unenroll your macOS device from management:

1. Sign in to the Company Portal for macOS.
2. Go to **Devices** and select the device you want to unenroll.

3. Select the ellipses menu icon > **Remove**.

- You can't use company apps and company data on your device anymore.

- You might not be able to connect to your company network using Wi-Fi or a virtual private network (VPN) anymore.
