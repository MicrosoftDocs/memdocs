# Unenroll your macOS device from Company Portal

When you unenroll your macOS device from Intune, your device can no longer access company resources.

Follow these steps to unenroll your macOS device from management:

1. Sign in to the Company Portal for macOS.
2. Go to **Devices** and select the device you want to unenroll.

3. Select the ellipses menu icon > **Remove**.
4. A confirmation message appears. Select **Remove** to unenroll your device. 

When you unenroll your device from Intune, here's what happens:

- Your device doesn't appear in the Company Portal.

- You can't install apps from the Company Portal.

- Any settings that were changed on your device when you added it (like password length) no longer apply.

- You might not have access to some company resources, such as file shares or internal web sites, on your device anymore.

- You can't use company apps and company data on your device anymore.

- You might not be able to connect to your company network using Wi-Fi or a virtual private network (VPN) anymore.

- Company email access may be removed from the device.
