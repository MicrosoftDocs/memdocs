# Remove your device from the Company Portal

If you decide you no longer want your device to be managed by your company or organization, you can remove it from the Company Portal via the [Company Portal website](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2010980). If you remove your device, it will no longer be listed in the Company Portal. You may also lose access to your organization's data, apps, and email.

To remove your device:

1. On the [Company Portal website](https://portal.manage.microsoft.com), select the __Menu__ button > __Devices__.  

2. Select the device you want to remove.  

    ![A screenshot of the Devices page, with 2 tiles that show unidentified, generically named devices. A gray banner sits directly below the devices and prompts user to identify the device they are using or add a new one.](./media/rename-reset-device-step2-1808.png) 

3. Select **Remove**. If the remove option isn't visible at the top of your page, select **More (â€¦)** > **Remove**.
