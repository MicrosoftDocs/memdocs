# Send logs to the Company Portal developers for Android devices

Sometimes the Company Portal app may close unexpectedly. App developers want to hear from you when unexpected behavior occurs, so they can find the root cause and prevent future occurrences. Such errors are detailed on your device in a special document called a _diagnostic log_. The Company Portal team needs the Company Portal-specific logs to diagnose the problem.

> [!Note]
> To make it easier for your company support to find the cause of the problem, turn on _verbose logging_. Verbose logging records all details about an error and includes these details in the report. Find out how to [turn on verbose logging here](use-verbose-logging-to-help-your-it-administrator-fix-device-issues-android.md). 

To send logs to Microsoft:

1. Open the Company Portal app.

2. Tap **Menu** > **Help** > **Email Support**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > **Menu** could be a software button or a hardware button, depending on which Android device you have.

3. Tap **Upload Logs Only**.

4. After the upload is complete, you will receive an incident ID. Save the ID for your records.

To directly contact the Company Portal team for Android, email <a href="mailto:wintunedroidfbk@microsoft.com?subject=Send logs to Microsoft&body=Describe the issue you are having.">wintunedroidfbk@microsoft.com</a>.
