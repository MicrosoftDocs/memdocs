# Set up Android device with Company Portal and Entrust

Enroll your device with the Microsoft Intune app to gain secure, mobile access to your organization's email, files, and apps. After your device is enrolled, it becomes *managed*. Your organization can assign policies and apps to the device through a mobile device management (MDM) provider, such as Intune.

During enrollment, you'll also install a derived credential on your device. Your organization might require you to use the derived credential as an authentication method when accessing resources, or for signing and encrypting emails.

You likely need to set up a derived credential if you use a smart card to:

* Sign in to school or work apps, Wi-Fi, and virtual private networks (VPN)
* Sign and encrypt school or work emails using S/MIME certificates

In this article, you will:

* Enroll a mobile Android device with the Intune app
* Set up your smart card by installing a derived credential from your organization's derived credential provider, [Entrust](https://www.entrust.com/)

## What are derived credentials?

A derived credential is a certificate that's derived from your smart card credentials and installed on your device. It grants you remote access to work resources, while preventing unauthorized users from accessing sensitive information.

Derived credentials are used to:

* Authenticate students and employees who sign in to school or work apps, Wi-Fi, and VPN
* Sign and encrypt school or work emails with S/MIME certificates

Derived credentials are an implementation of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) guidelines for Derived Personal Identity Verification (PIV) credentials as part of Special Publication (SP) 800-157.

## Prerequisites

 To complete enrollment, you must have:

* Your school or work-provided smart card
* Access to a computer or kiosk where you can sign in with your smart card
* A new or factory-reset device running Android 7.0 or later
* The Microsoft Intune app installed on your device
