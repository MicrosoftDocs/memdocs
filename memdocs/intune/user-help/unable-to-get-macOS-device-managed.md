# Unable to get macOS device managed

If you receive either of the following messages while trying to get your macOS device managed, contact your company support.

**Message 1**: *We're having trouble getting your device managed. This problem could be caused if you're using a virtual machine, have a restricted serial number, or if this device is already assigned to someone else. Learn how to resolve these problems or contact your company support.*

**Message 2**: *It looks like you're using a virtual machine. Make sure you've fully configured your virtual machine, including serial number and hardware model. If this isn't a virtual machine, please contact support.*  

Your device might not be able to be managed for one of the following reasons: 

* A macOS virtual machine (VM) isn't configured correctly   

* Your organization requires that the device is corporate-owned or has a registered device serial number   

* The device is already managed, and is assigned to someone else in your organization  

Your company support or IT admin will help you identify and resolve the problem that applies to your device.  

To find your company support's contact information, sign in to the [Company Portal website](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2010980).
