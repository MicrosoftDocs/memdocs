# Set up Android device with the Microsoft Intune app and DISA Purebred

Enroll your device with the Microsoft Intune app to gain secure, mobile access to your work email, files, and apps. After your device is enrolled, it becomes *managed*, which means your organization can assign policies and apps to the device through a mobile device management (MDM) provider, such as Microsoft Intune.  

During enrollment, you'll also install a derived credential on your device. Your organization might require you to use the derived credential as an authentication method when accessing resources, or for signing and encrypting emails.

You likely need to set up a derived credential if you use a smart card to:

* Sign in to school or work apps, Wi-Fi, and virtual private networks (VPN)
* Sign and encrypt school or work emails using S/MIME certificates

In this article, you will:

* Enroll a mobile Android device with the Intune app
* Set up your smart card by installing a derived credential from your organization's derived credential provider, [DISA Purebred](https://public.cyber.mil/pki-pke/purebred/)

## What are derived credentials?

A derived credential is a certificate that's derived from your smart card credentials and installed on your device. It grants you remote access to work resources, while preventing unauthorized users from accessing sensitive information.

Derived credentials are used to:

* Authenticate students and employees who sign in to school or work apps, Wi-Fi, and VPN
* Sign and encrypt school or work emails with S/MIME certificates

Derived credentials are an implementation of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) guidelines for Derived Personal Identity Verification (PIV) credentials as part of Special Publication (SP) 800-157.

## Prerequisites

To complete enrollment, you must have:

* Your school or work-provided smart card
* Access to a computer or kiosk where you can sign in with your smart card
* A new or factory-reset device running Android 8.0 or later 
* The Microsoft Intune app installed on your device
* The Purebred app installed on your device (App should automatically install shortly after device setup. If it doesn't, contact your IT support person.)

You'll also need to contact a Purebred agent or representative during setup.

## Enroll device

## Set up smart card  

> [!NOTE]
> The Purebred app is required to complete these steps and will automatically install on your device after enrollment. If you still don't have the app after waiting a short while, contact your IT support person.  

1. After enrollment is complete, the Intune app will notify you to set up your smart card. Tap the notification. If you don't get a notification, check your email.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Screenshot of the Intune app push notification on device home screen.](./media/enroll-android-device-disa-purebred/action-required-in-app-android.png)

2. On the **Set up smart card** screen:

   1. Tap the link to your organization's setup instructions and review them. If your organization doesn't provide additional instructions, you'll be sent to this article.

   2. Tap **BEGIN**.   

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Screenshot of the Intune app, Set up smart card screen.](./media/enroll-android-device-disa-purebred/smart-card-open-disa-purebred-android.png)

3. On the **Get certificates** screen, tap **LAUNCH PUREBRED** to open the Purebred app. (The app should have been installed automatically on your device. If you don't have it, contact your support person.)  

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Screenshot of the Intune app prompt to open DISA Purebred app.](./media/enroll-android-device-disa-purebred/open-app-prompt-disa-purbred-android.png)  

4. The Purebred app might need additional permissions from you in order to run properly. Tap **Allow** or **Allow all the time** when prompted. For more information about why these permissions are required, speak with your support person or Purebred agent.  

5. Once you're in the Purebred app, work with your organization's Purebred agent to download and install the certificates you need to access work or school resources.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > During this process, tap **OK** or **Install** when prompted. Don't change the names of any certificate authorities (CAs) or certificates that you're prompted to install.    

6. After installation is complete, you'll receive a notification that your certificates are ready. Tap the notification to return to the Intune app.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Screenshot of the "Allow access to certificates" screen](./media/enroll-android-device-disa-purebred/certificates-ready-prompt-disa-purbred-android.png)

7. From the **Allow access to certificates** screen, you'll give the Intune app permission to access the derived credential you got from DISA Purebred. This step ensures that your organization can verify your identity whenever you access protected work or school resources.  

    1. Tap **NEXT**.

       > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
       > ![Screenshot of the "Certificates are ready" prompt](./media/enroll-android-device-disa-purebred/certificates-access-disa-purbred-android.png)

    2. When you're prompted to **Choose certificate**, don't change the selection. The correct certificate is already selected, so just tap **Select** or **OK**.  

       > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
       > ![Screenshot of the "Choose certificate" prompt](./media/enroll-android-device-disa-purebred/choose-certificates-prompt-disa-purbred-android.png)

    3. Your derived credential is made up of multiple certificates, so you might see the **Choose certificate** prompt multiple times. Repeat the previous step until no more prompts appear.  

8. Once all of the certificates are processed, wait for the Intune app to finish setting up your device. You'll know setup is complete when you see the **You're all set!** screen.  

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Screenshot of the "You're all set" screen](./media/enroll-android-device-disa-purebred/all-set-android.png)
