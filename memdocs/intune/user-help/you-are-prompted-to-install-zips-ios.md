# Install Zimperium zIPS on your iOS device

Before you can access your work, your company support needs you to install the Zimperium zIPS app, which helps to protect your device by finding potential security threats. You might see different prompts on your device, depending on how your company set up Zimperium zIPS.

## What you need to do 

1. If you see a following prompt, tap **Install** to allow Zimperium zIPS to be installed on your device.

2. When you see the following message, tap **Settings**, turn on **Location Services**, and then tap **Continue**.

3. Review the permissions that Zimperium zIPS needs, and tap **Continue**.

4. At the prompt asking you to allow Zimperium zIPS to send you notifications, tap **Allow**.

5. Zimperium zIPS finishes installing and shows you the welcome screen.

6. Once you've completed setup, you see the following screen if no security threats are found on your device.

If Zimperium zIPS finds a security threat on your device, you will see instructions on how to fix the issue.

## If the installation doesn't work

Sometimes installations can fail due to technical issues beyond your control. If this happens, try installing Zimperium zIPS [manually from the App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/app/zimperium-zips/id1030924459).
