# Your device needs antimalware software

Malware is any software that is designed to disrupt daily operations for your company, often by stealing information from you or your device. To prevent this from potentially happening, your organization is requiring you to enable a security feature that helps to protect your device when it starts up.

Follow [these instructions](https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/How-to-turn-on-Early-84552ec5) to turn on Windows Early-Launch Anti-Malware (ELAM).
