## Prerequisites 

AOSP devices must meet the following requirements to enroll:  

* New or factory-reset 
* Running Android 10.0 or later 
* Corporate-owned (not a personal device) 
* [A supported device](../fundamentals/supported-devices-browsers.md#android)  

Additionally, you need the enrollment QR code that's provided by your organization.  

## Enroll device  
Complete these steps to set up and enroll your device.  

1. Turn on your new or factory-reset device.  
2. If prompted to, connect to Wi-Fi. Then tap **NEXT**. 
3. Scan the QR code provided by your organization. 
4. Follow the onscreen prompts to enroll your device. 
5. If prompted to, review the device terms and conditions. Then select **ACCEPT & CONTINUE**. 
6. The Microsoft Intune app opens. The next step depends on the type of device you're using. Complete the step that matches the screen shown on your device: 

   - Tap **START** to begin enrollment.  
   - Sign in with your work account.
