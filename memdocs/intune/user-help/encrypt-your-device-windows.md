# How to protect your Windows device using encryption

When you encrypt a device, you are wrapping the information on it in a layer of protective code that prevents unauthorized people from accessing it. As a step towards making sure your information is secured, your organization is requiring you to encrypt your Windows device to protect company or school data. 

If you have a Windows phone and have enrolled it, your device will be encrypted automatically if encryption is required.

> [!Note]
> Encryption is not supported on Windows 10 Home. Learn how to upgrade from [Windows 10 Home to Windows 10 Pro](https://support.microsoft.com/help/12384/windows-10-upgrading-home-to-pro).


If you have a desktop device, the following instructions describe how to encrypt it.

1. Search for and then start the **Manage BitLocker** app.

2. Choose **Turn on BitLocker**, and then follow the instructions to encrypt each of your drives.
