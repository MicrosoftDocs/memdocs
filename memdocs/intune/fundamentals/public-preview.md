# Public preview in Microsoft Intune

Microsoft Intune releases features in **public preview**. These features are being actively developed, and might not be complete. They're made available on a "Preview" basis. You can test and use these features in production environments and scenarios, and provide feedback.

Preview features have a **(preview)** tag in the Microsoft Intune admin center:

## What you need to know

When working with features in public preview, these features:

- Might have restrictions or limited functionality. For example, the feature might only apply to one platform.
- Typically go through feature changes before they're generally available (GA).
- Are fully supported by Microsoft.
- Might only be available in selected geographic regions or cloud environments. For example, the feature might not exist in the [Azure Government](/azure/azure-government/documentation-government-welcome) cloud.
- Can have more usage and support restrictions. If so, this information is typically noted in the feature documentation.
