# App and device properties, operators, and rule editing when creating filters in Microsoft Intune

When you create an app, compliance policy, or configuration profile, you assign that app or policy to groups (users or devices). When you assign the app or policy, you can also use [assignment filters](filters.md).

You can use filters on **managed devices** (devices enrolled in Intune) and **managed apps** (apps managed by Intune).

When you create a filter, you enter the app or device properties to use in your filter. For example:

- In your managed device filter, enter the device manufacturer so the policy only applies to Microsoft devices.
- In your managed app filter, enter the OS version so the policy only applies to devices with that specific OS version.

Advanced rule editing is also available. You can use common operators, such as `and`, `contains`, and `startsWith` to create expressions. These expressions are saved and used in your filter.

This article describes the different [managed device properties](#managed-device-properties), [managed app properties](#managed-app-properties), and [operators](#supported-operators) you can use in your filters, and gives examples.

[!INCLUDE [android_device_administrator_support](../includes/android-device-administrator-support.md)]

## Managed device properties

You can use the following device properties in your managed device filter rules:

- **`cpuArchitecture` (CPU Architecture)**: Create a filter rule based on the Intune device CPU architecture property.

  For Windows, your options are (with `-eq`, `-ne`, `-in`, `-notIn` operators):

  - amd64
  - x86
  - arm64
  - unknown

  For macOS, your options are (with `-eq`, `-ne`, `-in`, `-notIn` operators):

  - x64
  - arm64
  - unknown

  Examples:

  - `(device.cpuArchitecture -eq "arm64")`
  - `(device.cpuArchitecture -in ["x64", "arm64"])`
  - `(device.cpuArchitecture -eq "unknown")`

  This property applies to:

  - macOS
  - Windows 11
  - Windows 10

  > [!NOTE]
  > Currently, enrollment scenarios don't support the `cpuArchitecture` property. Support will be added in a future update (no ETA).

- **`deviceCategory` (Device Category)**: Create a filter rule based on the Intune device category property. Enter the full string value (using `-eq`, `-ne`, `-in`, `-notIn` operators), or partial value (using `-startswith`, `-contains`, `-notcontains` operators).

  Examples:

  - `(device.deviceCategory -eq "Engineering devices")`
  - `(device.deviceCategory -contains "Engineering")`
  - `(device.model -startsWith "E")`

  This property applies to:

  - Android device administrator
  - Android Enterprise
  - Android (AOSP)
  - iOS/iPadOS
  - macOS
  - Windows 11
  - Windows 10

- **`deviceName` (Device Name)**: Create a filter rule based on the Intune device name property. Enter a string value for the device's full name (using `-eq`, `-ne`, `-in`, `-notIn` operators), or partial value (using `-startswith`, `-contains`, `-notcontains` operators).

  Examples:

  - `(device.deviceName -eq "Scott's Device")`
  - `(device.deviceName -in ["Scott's device", "Sara's device"])`
  - `(device.deviceName -startsWith "S")`

  This property applies to:

  - Android device administrator
  - Android Enterprise
  - Android (AOSP)
  - iOS/iPadOS
  - macOS
  - Windows 11
  - Windows 10

- **`deviceOwnership` (Ownership)**: Create a filter rule based on the device's ownership property in Intune. Select `Personal`, `Corporate`, or unknown values using the `-eq` and `-ne` operators. 

  Example:

  - `(device.deviceOwnership -eq "Personal")`

  This property applies to:

  - Android device administrator
  - Android Enterprise
  - Android (AOSP)
  - iOS/iPadOS
  - macOS
  - Windows 11
  - Windows 10

- **`deviceTrustType` (Microsoft Entra join type)**: Create a filter rule based on the device's Microsoft Entra join type. Choose between Azure AD joined, Azure AD registered, Hybrid Azure AD joined,  or Unknown values (with `-eq`, `-ne`, `-in`, `-notIn` operators).

  Examples:

  - `(device.deviceTrustType -eq "Azure AD joined")`
  - `(device.deviceTrustType -ne "Azure AD registered")`
  - `(device.deviceTrustType -in ["Hybrid Azure AD joined","Azure AD joined"])`

  This property applies to:

  - Windows 11
  - Windows 10

  > [!NOTE]
  > The `deviceTrustType` property exists in Microsoft Entra ID and Intune. The values in this Intune filters article apply to Intune. They don't apply to Microsoft Entra ID.

- **`enrollmentProfileName` (Enrollment profile name)**: Create a filter rule based on the enrollment profile name. This property is applied to a device when the device enrolls. It's a string value created by you, and matches the Windows Autopilot, Apple Automated Device Enrollment (ADE), or Google enrollment profile applied to the device. To see your enrollment profile names, sign in to the [Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431), and go to **Devices** > **Enroll devices**.

  Enter the full string value (using `-eq`, `-ne`, `-in`, `-notIn` operators), or partial value (using `-startswith`, `-contains`, `-notcontains` operators).

  Examples:

  - `(device.enrollmentProfileName -eq "DEP iPhones")`
  - `(device.enrollmentProfileName -startsWith "Autopilot Profile")`
  - `(device.enrollmentProfileName -ne $null)`

  This property applies to:

  - Android Enterprise
  - Android (AOSP)
  - iOS/iPadOS
  - Windows 11
  - Windows 10

- **`IsRooted` (Rooted or jailbroken)**: Create a filter rule based on the device's rooted (Android) or jailbroken (iOS/iPadOS) device property. Select `True`, `False`, or unknown values using the `-eq` and `-ne` operators.

  Example:

  - `(device.isRooted -eq "True")`

  This property applies to:

  - Android device administrator
  - Android Enterprise (Work profile only)
  - Android (AOSP)
  - iOS/iPadOS

- **`manufacturer` (Manufacturer)**: Create a filter rule based on the Intune device manufacturer property. Enter the full string value (using `-eq`, `-ne`, `-in`, `-notIn` operators), or partial value (using `-startswith`, `-contains`, `-notcontains` operators).

  Examples:

  - `(device.manufacturer -eq "Microsoft")`
  - `(device.manufacturer -startsWith "Micro")`

  This property applies to:

  - Android device administrator
  - Android Enterprise
  - Android (AOSP)
  - iOS/iPadOS
  - macOS
  - Windows 11
  - Windows 10

- **`model` (Model)**: Create a filter rule based on the Intune device model property. Enter the full string value (using `-eq`, `-ne`, `-in`, `-notIn` operators), or partial value (using `-startswith`, `-contains`, `-notcontains` operators).

  For iOS/iPadOS and macOS devices, use the model, not the product name. Only the model is recognized for Apple devices. For example, for iPhone 8 devices, enter the model as `iPhone 8`.
  
  Examples:

  - `(device.model -eq "Surface Book 3")`
  - `(device.model -in ["Surface Book 3", "Surface Book 2"])`
  - `(device.model -startsWith "Surface Book")`
  - `(device.model -startsWith "MacBookPro")`
  - `(device.model -startsWith "iPhone 8")`

  This property applies to:

  - Android device administrator
  - Android Enterprise
  - Android (AOSP)
  - iOS/iPadOS
  - macOS
  - Windows 11
  - Windows 10

- **`operatingSystemVersion` (Operating System Version)**: Create a filter rule based on the Intune device operating system (OS) version. Enter a version value (using `-eq`, `-ne`, `-gt`, `-ge`, `-lt`, `-le` operators).

  Examples:

  - `(device.operatingSystemVersion -eq 14.2.1)`
  - `(device.operatingSystemVersion -gt 10.0.22000.1000)`
  - `(device.operatingSystemVersion -le 10.0.22631.3235)`

  For a list of supported operators, go to [operatingSystemVersion supported operators](#operatingsystemversion-supported-operators) (in this article).

  This property applies to:

  - Android device administrator
  - Android Enterprise
  - Android (AOSP)
  - iOS/iPadOS
  - macOS
  - Windows 11
  - Windows 10

  > [!NOTE]
  > The `operatingSystemVersion` property is in public preview. For more information on what that means, go to [Public preview in Microsoft Intune](../fundamentals/public-preview.md).

- **`osVersion` (OS Version)**: Create a filter rule based on the Intune device operating system (OS) version. Enter the full string value (using `-eq`, `-ne`, `-in`, `-notIn` operators), or partial value (using `-startswith`, `-contains`, `-notcontains` operators).

  > [!TIP]
  > The `osVersion` property is being deprecated. Instead, use the `operatingSystemVersion` property. When `operatingSystemVersion` is generally available (GA), the `osVersion` property will retire, and you won't be able to create new filters using this property. Existing filters that use `osVersion` continue to work.

  Examples:

  - `(device.osVersion -eq "14.2.1")`
  - `(device.osVersion -in ["10.15.3 (19D2064)","10.14.2 (18C54)"])`
  - `(device.osVersion -startsWith "10.0.18362")`

  This property applies to:

  - Android device administrator
  - Android Enterprise
  - Android (AOSP)
  - iOS/iPadOS
  - macOS
  - Windows 11
  - Windows 10
  
  > [!NOTE]
  > For Apple devices, the `OSversion` property doesn't include Apple's Security Patch Version (SPV) information. The SPV is the letter after the version number, like `14.1.2a`. When creating filters for Apple devices, don't include the SPV in the `OSversion` rule syntax.

- **`operatingSystemSKU` (Operating System SKU)**: Create a filter rule based on the device's Windows client OS SKU. Enter the full string value (using `-eq`, `-ne`, `-in`, `-notIn` operators), or partial value (using `-startswith`, `-contains`, `-notcontains` operators).

  Examples:

  - `(device.operatingSystemSKU -eq "Enterprise")`
  - `(device.operatingSystemSKU -in ["Enterprise", "EnterpriseS", "EnterpriseN", "EnterpriseEval"])`
  - `(device.operatingSystemSKU -startsWith "Enterprise")`

  You can use the following supported values for the **Operating System SKU** property. The [Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431) doesn't show the SKU names. So, be sure to use the supported values in the following table:

## Advanced rule editing

When you create a filter, you can manually create simple or complex rules in the rule syntax editor. You can also use common operators, such as `or`, `contains`, and more. The format is similar to Microsoft Entra dynamic groups: `([entity].[property name] [operation] [value])`.

### What you need to know

- The properties, operations, and values are case insensitive.
- Parentheses and nested parentheses are supported.
- You can use `Null` or `$Null` as a value with the `-Equals` and `-NotEquals` operators.
- Some advanced syntax options, such as nested parentheses, are only available in the rule syntax editor. If you use advanced expressions in the rule syntax editor, then the rule builder is disabled.

  For more information on the rule syntax editor and the rule builder, go to [Use filters when assigning your apps, policies, and profiles](filters.md)

### Supported operators

You can use the following operators in the rule syntax editor:

- **Or**: Use for all value types, especially when grouping simple rules.

  - **Allowed values**: `-or` | `or`
  - **Example**: `(device.manufacturer -eq "Samsung") or (device.model -contains "Galaxy Note")`

- **And**: Use for all value types, especially when grouping simple rules.

  - **Allowed values**: `-ne` | `ne`
  - **Example**: `(device.manufacturer -ne "Samsung") or (device.model -ne "Galaxy Note")`

- **StartsWith**: Use for string value types.

  - **Allowed values**: `-startsWith` | `startsWith`
  - **Example**: `(device.manufacturer -startsWith "Sams")`

- **In**: Use for array value types, such as `["1", "2"]`.

  - **Allowed values**: `-in` | `in`
  - **Example**: `(device.manufacturer -in ["Samsung","Lenovo","Microsoft"])`

- **NotIn**: Use for array value types, such as `["1", "2"]`.

  - **Allowed values**: `-notIn` | `notIn`
  - **Example**: `(device.manufacturer -notIn ["Samsung","Lenovo","Microsoft"])`

- **Contains**: Use for string value types.

  - **Allowed values**: `-contains` | `contains`
  - **Example**: `(device.manufacturer -contains "Samsung")`

- **NotContains**: Use for string value types.

  - **Allowed values**: `-notContains` | `notContains`
