# How is Intune for Education different from the full device management experience in Intune?

Intune for Education lets you manage Windows 10 and iOS/iPadOS devices using the full MDM capabilities available in Intune. The full device management experience lets you manage Windows, iOS/iPadOS, and Android devices.  

Intune for Education can be used by itself, or in harmony with the [full device management experience available in Intune](what-is-intune.md). It can also be used alongside the rest of the tools available in [Microsoft Education](https://microsoft.com/education), which makes it easy for you to use Intune for Education with other useful educational tools from Microsoft.
