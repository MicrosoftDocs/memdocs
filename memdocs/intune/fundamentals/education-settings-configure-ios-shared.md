# Configure Intune education settings for shared iPad devices

[!INCLUDE [azure_portal](../includes/azure_portal.md)]

> [!NOTE]
> Intune doesn't currently support configuring the Classroom app. This article is only applicable for users with existing iOS/iPadOS education profiles in Intune.

Intune supports the iOS/iPadOS Classroom app that helps teachers to guide learning, and control student devices in the classroom. In addition, to the Classroom app, Apple supports the ability for student iPad devices to be configured such that multiple students can share a single device. This document guides you to achieve this goal with Intune.

For information about configuring dedicated (1:1) iPad devices to use the Classroom app, see [How to configure Intune settings for the iOS/iPadOS Classroom app](education-settings-configure-ios.md).

## Before you start

The prerequisites to use the shared iPad capabilities are:

- Setup [Apple School Manager](../enrollment/apple-school-manager-set-up-ios.md) and [School Data Sync (SDS)](https://support.office.com/article/Apple-School-Manager-integration-with-Intune-for-Education-and-School-Data-Sync-974bd1f9-2c7a-45cb-9447-b58166108617).
- As part of Apple School Manager setup, configure [Managed Apple IDs](https://school.apple.com/) for students. [Learn more about Managed Apple IDs](https://support.apple.com/HT205918).
- Create an enrollment profile for the device serial numbers synced from Apple School Manager.

## Step 1 - Import your school data into Microsoft Entra ID

Use Microsoft's School Data Sync (SDS) to import school records from an existing Student Information System (SIS) to Microsoft Entra ID.
SDS synchronizes information from your SIS and stores it in Microsoft Entra ID. Microsoft Entra ID is a Microsoft management system that helps you organize users and devices. You can then use this data to help you manage your students and classes. [Learn more about how to deploy SDS](https://support.office.com/article/Overview-of-School-Data-Sync-and-Classroom-f3d1147b-4ade-4905-8518-508e729f2e91).

### How to import data using SDS

You can import information into SDS by using one of the following methods:

- [CSV files](https://support.office.com/article/Follow-these-steps-71d5fe4a-aa51-4f35-9b53-348898a390a1) - Manually export and compile comma-separated value (.csv) files
- [PowerSchool API](https://support.office.com/article/Follow-these-steps-851b5edc-558f-43a9-9122-b2d63458cb8f) - An SIS provider that simplifies syncing with Microsoft Entra ID
- [OneRoster](https://support.office.com/article/Follow-these-steps-f43cbb2a-b502-497d-a8b1-783dc05a57ab) - A CSV format that you can export and convert to sync with Microsoft Entra ID

## Step 2 - Create and assign an iOS/iPadOS Education profile in Intune

### Configure general settings

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431).
2. Go to **Devices** > **Manage devices** > **Configuration** > **Create** > **New policy**.
3. Enter the following properties:

    - **Platform:** Select **iOS/iPadOS**.
    - **Profile type**: Select **Templates** > **Secure assessment (Education)**.

    Select **Create**.

4. In **Basics**, enter the following properties:

    - **Name**: Enter a descriptive name for the profile. For example, enter **iOS/iPadOS education profile**.
    - **Description**: Enter a description for the profile. This setting is optional, but recommended.

5. In **Configuration settings**, you need certificates to establish a trust relationship between teacher and student iPads. Certificates are used to seamlessly and silently authenticate connections between devices without having to enter user names and passwords.

>[!Important]
>The teacher and student certificates you use must be issued by different certificate authorities (CAs). You must create two new subordinate CAs connected to your existing certificate infrastructure; one for teachers, and one for students.

iOS education profiles support only PFX certificates. SCEP certificates are not supported.

Certificates you create must support server authentication in addition to user authentication.

### Configure teacher certificates

On the **Education** pane, choose **Teacher certificates**.

#### Configure teacher root certificate

Under **Teacher root certificate**, choose the browse button to select the teacher root certificate with the extension .cer (DER, or Base64 encoded), or .P7B (with or without full chain).

#### Configure teacher PKCS#12 certificate

Under **Teacher PKCS#12 certificate**, configure the following values:

- **Subject name format** - Intune automatically prefixes the certificate common name with **leader**, for the teacher certificate, and **member**, for the student certificate.
- **Certification authority** - An Enterprise Certification Authority (CA) that runs on an Enterprise edition of Windows Server 2008 R2 or later. A Standalone CA is not supported.
- **Certification authority name** - Enter the name of your certification authority.
- **Certificate template name**- Enter the name of a certificate template that has been added to an issuing CA.
- **Renewal threshold (%)** - Specify the percentage of the certificate lifetime that remains before the device requests renewal of the certificate.
- **Certificate validity period** - Specify the amount of remaining time before the certificate expires. You can specify a value that is lower than the validity period in the specified certificate template, but not higher. For example, if the certificate validity period in the certificate template is two years, you can specify a value of one year but not a value of five years. The value must also be lower than the remaining validity period of the issuing CA certificate.

When you have finished configuring teacher certificates, choose **OK**.

### Configure student certificates

1. On the **Education pane**, choose **Student certificates**.
2. On the **Student certificates** pane, from the **Student device certificates type** list, choose **Shared iPad**.

#### Configure student root certificate

Under **Device root certificate**, choose the browse button to select the student root certificate with the extension .cer (DER, or Base64 encoded), or .P7B (with or without full chain).

#### Configure device PKCS#12 certificate

Under **Student PKCS#12 certificate**, configure the following values:

- **Subject name format** - Intune automatically prefixes the certificate common name with leader, for the teacher certificate, and member, for the device certificate.
- **Certification authority** - An Enterprise Certification Authority (CA) that runs on an Enterprise edition of Windows Server 2008 R2 or later. A Standalone CA is not supported.
- **Certification authority name** - Enter the name of your certification authority.
- **Certificate template name** - Enter the name of a certificate template that has been added to an issuing CA.
- **Renewal threshold (%)** - Specify the percentage of the certificate lifetime that remains before the device requests renewal of the certificate.
- **Certificate validity period** - Specify the amount of remaining time before the certificate expires. You can specify a value that is lower than the validity period in the specified certificate template, but not higher. For example, if the certificate validity period in the certificate template is two years, you can specify a value of one year but not a value of five years. The value must also be lower than the remaining validity period of the issuing CA certificate.

When you are finished configuring certificates, choose **OK**.
