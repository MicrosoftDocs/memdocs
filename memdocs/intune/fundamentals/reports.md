# Intune reports

Microsoft Intune reports allow you to more effectively and proactively monitor the health and activity of endpoints across your organization, and also provides other reporting data across Intune. For example, you'll be able to see reports about device compliance, device health, and device trends. In addition, you can create custom reports to obtain more specific data. 

> [!NOTE]
> The Intune reporting changes will roll out gradually over a period of time to help you prepare and adapt to the new structure.

The report types are organized into the following focus areas:
- **Operational** - Provides timely, targeted data that helps you focus and take action. Admins, subject matter experts, and helpdesk will find these reports most helpful.
- **Organizational** - Provides a broader summary of an overall view, such as device management state. Managers and admins will find these reports most helpful.
- **Historical** - Provides patterns and trends over a period of time. Managers and admins will find these reports most helpful.
- **Specialist** - Allows you to use raw data to create your own custom reports. Admins will find these reports most helpful.

The reporting framework provides a consistent and more comprehensive reporting experience. The available reports provide the following functionality:
- **Search and sort** – You can search and sort across every column, no matter how large the dataset.
- **Data paging** – You can scan your data based on paging, either page-by-page or by jumping to a specific page.
- **Performance** - You can quickly generate and view reports created from large tenants.
- **Export** – You can quickly export reporting data generated from large tenants.

> [!NOTE]
> Intune can maintain your report search results when exporting report data. For example, when you use the [Noncompliant devices](../fundamentals/reports.md#noncompliant-devices-report-organizational) report, set the OS filter to "Windows", and search for "PC", the exported data will only contain Windows devices with "PC" in their name. This capability is also available when calling the `ExportJobs` API directly.

## Who can access the data?

Users with the following permissions can review logs:

- Global Administrator
- Intune Administrator
- Administrators assigned to an Intune role with **Read** permissions

For more information about administrator permissions, see [Types of administrators](../fundamentals/users-add.md#types-of-administrators).

## Reporting tiles

The **Home**, **Dashboard**, and **Apps Overview** panes provide updated tiles to show the number of app installation failures for the tenant. You can use the following export **ReportName** parameters to retrieve the related data:

**Export ReportName Parameters:**
- `AppStatusOverview` - App overview count as provided for the pie chart on the **Apps Overview** pane.
- `FailedAppCounts` - Failed app counts as provided on the **Apps Overview** pane, **Home** pane, and **Dashboard** pane.
- `TopFailedMobileApps` - Top three failed apps as provided on the **Apps Overview** pane.

## Device compliance reports

This set of reports focuses on compliance settings in your policies. You can get a list of all the devices that are noncompliant, review device compliance trends, and see the device names and their individual noncompliant settings.

> [!TIP]
> You can view a list of all device monitoring reports in [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431) by selecting **Devices** > **Monitor**. The **Monitor** pane provides reports related to configuration, compliance, enrollment, and software updates. Additionally, there are other reports that you can view, such as **Device actions**.

### Device compliance report (Organizational)

The device compliance report is meant to be broad in nature and provide a more traditional reporting view of data to identify aggregated metrics. This report is designed to work with large datasets to get a full device compliance picture. For example, the device compliance report for device compliance shows all the compliance states for devices to give a broader view of the data, no matter how large the dataset. This report shows the full breakdown of records in addition to a convenient visualization of aggregated metrics. This report can be generated by applying filters on it and selecting the **Generate report** button. This button will refresh the data to show the latest state with the ability to view the individual records that make up the aggregate data. Like most reports in the new framework, these records can be sorted and searched upon to focus on the information you need.

To see a generated report of device state, you can use the following steps:

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431).
2. Select **Reports** > **Device compliance** > **Reports** tab > **Device compliance**.
3. Select the **Compliance status**, **OS**, and **Ownership** filters to refine your report.
4. Select **Generate report** (or **Generate again**) to retrieve current data.

    ![Device compliance report](./media/intune-reports/intune-reports-02a.png)

    > [!NOTE]
    > This **Device compliance** report provides a time stamp of when the report was last generated. 

For related information, see [Enforce compliance for Microsoft Defender for Endpoint with Conditional Access in Intune](../protect/advanced-threat-protection.md).

### Device compliance trends report (Historical)

The device compliance trend report is more likely to be used by admins and architects to identify long term trends for device compliance. The aggregated data is displayed over a period of time. It's useful for making future investment decisions, driving process improvements, or prompting investigation into any anomalies. Filters can also be applied to see specific trends. The data provided by this report is a snapshot of the current tenant state (near real-time). 

A compliance trend report for device compliance can show the trend of device compliance states over a period of time. You can identify where compliance peaks occurred and focus your time and effort accordingly.

You can view the **Device compliance trends** report using the following steps:

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431).
2. Select **Reports** > **Device compliance** > **Reports** tab > **Device compliance trends** to view device compliance over a 60 day trend.

    ![Intune trend report](./media/intune-reports/intune-reports-03.png)

### Noncompliant devices report (Organizational)

> [!NOTE]
> In addition to this report, see [Noncompliant devices report](#noncompliant-devices-report-operational).

This report allows admins to quickly see:

- The devices that are noncompliant.
- For each device, the settings the device is noncompliant with, and the compliance policies that include these settings.
- For each device, any settings in an error state.

The benefit is you can see the noncompliant settings and settings in error state for all targeted devices at once. You don't need to check the **Device compliance** view for each device individually.

To generate the report, use the following steps:

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431).
2. Select **Reports** > **Device compliance** > **Reports** tab > **Noncompliant devices and settings**.
3. Select **Generate report**. In the report, look at the following information:

    - **Noncompliant setting** - Shows the name of the noncompliant policy setting.
    - **Noncompliant policy** - Shows the name of the compliance policy that includes the noncompliant setting.
    - **Calculated policy version** - Shows the compliance policy version that was used the last time compliance was calculated.
    - **Latest policy version** - Shows the most recent version of the noncompliant compliance policy. If this version number is greater than the **Calculated policy version**, then an admin updated or changed the compliance policy since the last time compliance was calculated. The compliance state might be out-of-date.
    - **Setting compliance state** - Shows if the device is noncompliant with the setting. Or, shows if the setting reported an error to Intune instead.
    - **Setting error code** - If the setting compliance state is `Error`, then it shows the error code. Otherwise, this column is left blank.

The report generates one row per device per noncompliant setting within the assigned compliance policy. So, a device that's noncompliant with four different settings will be in the list four times, once for each setting.

In this report, you can also:

- Export the report data.
- Filter the results by compliance state, OS platform, and setting compliance state.
- Search by each column.
- Sort the columns in ascending and descending order.
- Page through the results using the **Previous** and **Next** buttons.

### Devices without compliance policy (Organizational)

This report allows admins to:

- Identify devices that haven't been assigned a compliance policy.
  
  We recommend that every device in each tenant is targeted by a compliance policy.

- View the configuration of the tenant-wide *Compliance policy setting* named **Mark devices with no compliance policy assigned as**. By default, this setting marks a device without an assigned policy as *Compliant*.

  We recommend that this setting be configured to mark devices that aren't targeted by a compliance policy as *Not compliant*. To aid admins in managing this setting, the report provides a link that opens the *Compliance policy settings* node where setting can be changed. For more information, see [Compliance policy settings](../protect/device-compliance-get-started.md#compliance-policy-settings).

To generate the report, use the following steps:

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431).
2. Select **Reports** > **Device compliance** > **Reports** tab > **Devices without compliance policy**.
3. Select **Generate report**. In the report, look at the following information:

## Azure Monitor reports

### Azure Monitor integration reports (Specialist)
You can customize your own reports to get the data you want. The data in your reports will optionally be available via [Azure Monitor](/azure/azure-monitor/overview) using [Log Analytics](reports.md#log-analytics) and [Azure Monitor workbooks](reports.md#workbooks). These solutions allow you to create custom queries, configure alerts, and make dashboards to show the device compliance data in the manner you want. Additionally, you can retain the activity logs in your Azure storage account, integrate with the reports using [security information and event management (SIEM) tools](/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/siem-server-integration), and correlate the reports to Microsoft Entra activity logs. Azure Monitor workbooks can be used in addition to importing dashboards for custom reporting needs.

> [!NOTE]
> Complex reporting functionality require an Azure subscription.

An example specialist report could correlate a set of device details, including ownership data, with compliance data in a custom report. Then, this custom report could be displayed on an existing dashboard in the Microsoft Entra admin center.

You can create and view custom reports using the following steps:

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431).
2. Select **Reports** > **Diagnostic settings** add a [diagnostic setting](reports.md#diagnostic-settings).

    ![Intune Reports - Add diagnostic setting](./media/intune-reports/intune-reports-04.png)

3. Select **Add diagnostic setting** to display the **Diagnostic settings** pane. 
    
   > [!NOTE]
   > An Azure subscription is required to use this capability. 

4. Add a **Name** for the diagnostic settings. 
5. Select the **Send to Log Analytics** and **DeviceComplianceOrg** settings.

    ![Intune Reports - Diagnostic settings](./media/intune-reports/intune-reports-04a.png)

6. Select **Save**.
7. Next, select **Log analytics** to create and run a new log query using [Log Analytics](reports.md#log-analytics).

8. Select **Workbooks** to create or open an interactive report using [Azure Monitor workbooks](reports.md#workbooks).

   ![Workbooks - Interactive reports](./media/intune-reports/intune-reports-07.png)

### Diagnostic settings 
Each Azure resource requires its own diagnostic setting. The diagnostic setting defines the following for a resource:

- Categories of logs and metric data sent to the destinations defined in the setting. The available categories will vary for different resource types.
- One or more destinations to send the logs. Current destinations include Log Analytics workspace, Event Hubs, and Azure Storage.
- Retention policy for data stored in Azure Storage.

A single diagnostic setting can define one of each of the destinations. If you want to send data to more than one of a particular destination type (for example, two different Log Analytics workspaces), then create multiple settings. Each resource can have up to five diagnostic settings.

For more information, about diagnostic settings, see [Create diagnostic setting to collect platform logs and metrics in Azure](/azure/azure-monitor/platform/diagnostic-settings).

### Log Analytics
Log Analytics is the primary tool in the Azure portal for writing log queries and interactively analyzing the results of the queries. Even if a log query is used elsewhere in Azure Monitor, you'll typically write and test the query first using Log Analytics. For details about using Log Analytics and creating log queries, see [Overview of log queries in Azure Monitor](/azure/azure-monitor/log-query/log-query-overview). 

### Workbooks
Workbooks combine text, Analytics queries, Azure Metrics, and parameters into rich interactive reports. Workbooks are editable by any other team members who have access to the same Azure resources. For more information about workbooks, see [Azure Monitor workbooks](/azure/azure-monitor/app/usage-workbooks). Also, you can work with and contribute to workbook templates. For more information, see [Azure Monitor Workbook Templates](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=867045).
