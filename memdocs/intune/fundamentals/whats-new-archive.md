# What's new in the Microsoft Intune - previous months

[!INCLUDE [azure_portal](../includes/azure_portal.md)]

<!-- ########################## -->

## Week of October 23, 2023 (Service release 2310)

### App management

#### Update for users of Android Company Portal app<!-- 25109006   -->

If users launch a version of the Android Company Portal app below version 5.0.5333.0 (released November 2021), they'll see a prompt encouraging them to update their Android Company Portal app. If a user with an older Android Company Portal version attempts a new device registration using a recent version of the Authenticator app, the process will likely fail. To resolve this behavior, update the Android Company Portal app.

#### Minimum SDK version warning for iOS devices<!-- 9410239  -->

The **Min SDK version** for the iOS Conditional Launch setting on iOS devices now includes a **warn** action. This action warns end users if the min SDK version requirement isn't met.

#### Samsung ended support for kiosk mode on Android device administrator (DA) devices<!-- 24810356  -->

Samsung marked the Samsung Knox kiosk APIs used on Android device administrator as deprecated in Knox 3.7 (Android 11).

Though the functionality might continue to work, there's no guarantee that it will continue working. Samsung won't fix bugs that might arise. For more information on Samsung support for deprecated APIs, see [What kind of support is offered after an API is deprecated?](https://docs.samsungknox.com/dev/knox-sdk/faqs/general/deprecated-api-support-change.htm) (opens Samsung's web site).

Instead, you can manage kiosk devices with Intune using [dedicated device management](../enrollment/android-kiosk-enroll.md).

Applies to:

- Android device administrator (DA)

#### Import and export settings catalog policies<!-- 3470151  -->

The Intune [settings catalog](../configuration/settings-catalog.md) lists all the settings you can configure, and all in one place (**Devices** > **Configuration** > **Create** > **New Policy** > Select your **platform** > For **Profile**, select **Settings catalog**).

The settings catalog policies can be imported and exported:

- To export an existing policy, select the profile > select the ellipsis > **Export JSON**.
- To import a previously exported settings catalog policy, select **Create** > **Import policy** > select the previously exported JSON file.

For more information about the settings catalog, see [Use the settings catalog to configure settings on Windows, iOS/iPadOS and macOS devices](../configuration/settings-catalog.md).

> [!NOTE]
>
> This feature is continuing to roll out. It may be a couple of weeks before it's available in your tenant.

#### New setting to block users from using the same password to unlock the device and access the work profile on Android Enterprise personally owned devices with a work profile<!-- 6167371  -->

On Android Enterprise personally owned devices with a work profile, users can use the same password to unlock the device and access the work profile.

There's a new setting that can enforce different passwords to unlock the device and access the work profile (**Devices** > **Configuration** > **Create** > **Android Enterprise** > **Personally Owned Work Profile** for platform > **Device Restrictions** for profile type):

- **One lock for device and work profile**: **Block** prevents users from using the same password for the lock screen on the device and work profile. End users are required to enter the device password to unlock the device and enter their work profile password to access their work profile. When set to **Not Configured** (default), Intune doesn't change or update this setting. By default, the OS might allow users to access their work profile using a single password.

This setting is optional and doesn't impact existing configuration profiles.

Currently, if the work profile password doesn't meet the policy requirements, then device users see a notification. The device isn't marked as non-compliant. A separate compliance policy for the work profile is being created and will be available in a future release.

Applies to:

- Android Enterprise personally owned devices with a work profile (BYOD)

For a list of settings you can configure on personally owned devices with a work profile, see [Android Enterprise device settings list to allow or restrict features on personally owned devices using Intune](../configuration/device-restrictions-android-enterprise-personal.md).

#### New settings available in the macOS settings catalog<!-- 24950434  -->

The [Settings Catalog](../configuration/settings-catalog.md) lists all the settings you can configure in a device policy, and all in one place.

There are new settings in the Settings Catalog. To see these settings, in the [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431), go to **Devices** > **Configuration** > **Create** > **macOS** > **Settings catalog** for profile type.

**Privacy > Privacy Preferences Policy Control**:

- System Policy App Data

**Restrictions**:

- Force On Device Only Dictation

Applies to:

- macOS

For more information about configuring Settings Catalog profiles in Intune, see [Create a policy using settings catalog](../configuration/settings-catalog.md).

### Device enrollment

#### Web based device enrollment with JIT registration for personal iOS/iPadOS devices<!-- 15412485  -->

Intune supports web-based device enrollment with just in time (JIT) registration for personal devices set up via Apple device enrollment. JIT registration reduces the number of authentication prompts shown to users throughout the enrollment experience and establishes SSO across the device. Enrollment takes place on the web version of Intune Company Portal, eliminating need for the Company Portal app. Also, this enrollment method enables employees and students without managed Apple IDs to enroll devices and access volume-purchased apps.

For more information, see [Set up web based device enrollment for iOS](../enrollment/web-based-device-enrollment-ios.md).

### Device management

#### Updates to the Intune add-ons page<!--17395941 -->

The Intune add-ons page under **Tenant administration** includes **Your add-ons**, **All add-ons**, and **Capabilities**. It provides an enhanced view into your trial or purchased licenses, the add-on capabilities you're licensed to use in your tenant, and support for new billing experiences in Microsoft admin center.

For more information, see [Remote Help on Android](../fundamentals/remote-help-android.md).

### Device security

#### Configure declarative software updates and passcode policies for Apple devices in the Settings Catalog<!-- 24989083  -->

You can manage software updates and passcode using Apple's declarative device management (DDM) configuration using the settings catalog (**Devices** > **Configuration** > **Create** > **iOS/iPadOS** or **macOS** for platform > **Settings catalog** for profile type > **Declarative device management**).

For more information about DDM, see [Apple's declarative device management (DDM)](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/devicemanagement/leveraging_the_declarative_management_data_model_to_scale_devices) (opens Apple's website).

DDM allows you to install a specific update by an enforced deadline. The autonomous nature of DDM provides an improved user experience as the device handles the entire software update lifecycle. It prompts users that an update is available and also downloads, prepares the device for the installation, & installs the update.

In the settings catalog, the following declarative software update settings are available at **Declarative device management > Software Update**:

- **Details URL**: The web page URL that shows the update details. Typically, this URL is a web page hosted by your organization that users can select if they need organization-specific help with the update.
- **Target Build Version**: The target build version to update the device to, like `20A242`. The build version can include a supplemental version identifier, like `20A242a`. If the build version you enter isn't consistent with the **Target OS Version** value you enter, then the **Target OS Version** value takes precedence.
- **Target Local Date Time**: The local date time value that specifies when to force install the software update. If the user doesn't trigger the software update before this time, then the device force installs it.
- **Target OS Version**: The target OS version to update the device to. This value is the OS version number, like `16.1`. You can also include a supplemental version identifier, like `16.1.1`.

For more information on this feature, see [Manage software updates with the settings catalog](../protect/managed-software-updates-ios-macos.md).

In the settings catalog, the following declarative passcode settings are available at **Declarative device management > Passcode**:

- **Automatic Device Lock**: Enter the maximum time period that a user can be idle before the system automatically locks the device.
- **Maximum Grace Period**: Enter the maximum time period that a user can unlock the device without a passcode.
- **Maximum Number of Failed Attempts**: Enter the maximum number of wrong passcode attempts before:
  - iOS/iPadOS wipes the device
  - macOS locks the device
- **Minimum Passcode Length**: Enter the minimum number of characters a passcode must have.
- **Passcode Reuse Limit**: Enter the number of previously used passcodes that can't be used.
- **Require Complex Passcode**: When set to **True**, a complex passcode is required. A complex passcode doesn't have repeated characters, and doesn't have increasing or decreasing characters, like `123` or `CBA`.
- **Require Passcode on Device**: When set to **True**, the user must set a passcode to access the device. If you don't set other passcode restrictions, then there aren't any requirements about the length or quality of the passcode.

Applies to:

- iOS/iPadOS 17.0 and later
- macOS 14.0 and later

For information about the settings catalog, see [Use the settings catalog to configure settings on Windows, iOS/iPadOS and macOS devices](../configuration/settings-catalog.md).

#### Mvision Mobile is now Trellix Mobile Security<!-- 16208061 -->

### Monitor and troubleshoot 

#### Updated reports for Update rings for Windows 10 and later<!-- 10159960 -->

Reporting for [Update rings for Windows 10 and later](../protect/windows-10-update-rings.md) has been updated to use Intune's improved reporting infrastructure. These changes align to similar improvements introduced for other Intune features.

With this change for reports for Update rings for Windows 10 and later, when you select an update rings policy in the Intune admin center, there isn't a left-pane navigation for *Overview*, *Manage*, or *Monitor* options. Instead, the policy view opens to a single pane that includes the following policy details:

- **Essentials** – including the policy name, created and modified dates, and more details.
- **Device and user check-in status** – This view is the default report view and includes:
  - A high-level overview of device status for this policy, and a *View report* button to open a more comprehensive report view.
  - A streamlined representation and count of the different device status values returned by devices assigned to the policy. The simplified bar and chart replace former doughnut charts seen in the prior reporting representation.
- Two other report tiles to open more reports. These tiles include:
  - **Device assignment status** – This report combines the same information as the previous Device status and User status reports, which are no longer available. However, with this change, pivots and drill-in through based on the user name is no longer available.

### Device configuration

#### Introducing Remote Launch on Remote Help<!--9843475 -->

With Remote Launch, the helper can launch Remote Help seamlessly on the helper and user's device from Intune by sending a notification to the user's device. This feature allows both helpdesk and the sharer to be connected to a session quickly without exchanging session codes.

Applies to:

- Windows 10/11

For more information, see [Remote Help](../fundamentals/remote-help-windows.md).

### Device management

#### Microsoft Intune ending support for Android device administrator on devices with GMS access in August 2024<!--13891824 -->

Microsoft Intune is ending support for [Android device administrator management](../enrollment/android-enroll-device-administrator.md) on devices with access to Google Mobile Services (GMS) on August 30, 2024. After that date, device enrollment, technical support, bug fixes, and security fixes will be unavailable.

If you currently use device administrator management, we recommend switching to another Android management option in Intune before support ends.

For more information, see [Ending support for Android device administrator on GMS devices](https://aka.ms/Intune-Android-DA-blog).

## Week of August 28, 2023

### Device configuration

#### Windows and Android support for 4096-bit key size for SCEP and PFX certificate profiles<!--16314561  -->

Intune [SCEP certificate profiles](../protect/certificates-profile-scep.md) and [PKCS certificate profiles](../protect/certificates-pfx-configure.md) for Windows and Android devices now support a **Key size (bits)** of **4096**. This key size is available for new profiles and existing profiles you choose to edit.

- SCEP profiles have always included the *Key size (bits)* setting and now support 4096 as an available configuration option.
- PKCS profiles don't include the *Key size (bits)* setting directly. Instead, an admin must [modify the certificate template on the Certification Authority](../protect/certificates-pfx-configure.md#configure-certificate-templates-on-the-ca) to set the *Minimum key size* to 4096.

If you use a third-party Certificate Authority (CA), you might need to contact your vendor for assistance with implementing the 4096-bit key size.

When updating or deploying new certificate profiles to take advantage of this new key size, we recommend using a staggered deployment approach. This approach can help avoid creating excessive demand for new certificates across a large number of devices at the same time.

With this update, be aware of the following limitations on Windows devices:

- 4096-bit key storage is supported only in the *Software Key Storage Provider* (KSP). The following don't support storing keys of this size:
  - The hardware TPM (Trusted Platform Module). As a workaround you can use the Software KSP for key storage.
  - Windows Hello for Business. There isn't a workaround at this time.

### Tenant administration

#### Access policies for multiple Administrator Approval are now generally available<!-- 24936423   -->

Access policies for multiple Administrator Approval are out of public preview and are now generally available. With these policies, you can protect a resource, like App deployments, by requiring any change to the deployment to be approved by one of a group of users who are *approvers* for the resource, before that change is applied.

For more information, see [Use Access policies to require multiple administrative approval](../fundamentals/multi-admin-approval.md).

## Week of August 21, 2023 (Service release 2308)

### App management

#### Managed Home Screen end-users prompted to grant exact alarm permission<!-- 19804494 -->  
Managed Home Screen uses the exact alarm permission to do the following actions:

- Automatically sign out users after a set time of inactivity on the device
- Launch a screen saver after a set period of inactivity
- Automatically relaunch MHS after a certain period of time when a user exits kiosk mode

For devices running Android 14 and higher, by default, the exact alarm permission will be denied. To make sure critical user functionality isn't impacted, end-users are prompted to grant exact alarm permission upon first launch of Managed Home Screen. For more information, see [Configure the Microsoft Managed Home Screen app for Android Enterprise](..\apps\app-configuration-managed-home-screen-app.md) and [Android's developer documentation]( https://developer.android.com/about/versions/14/changes/schedule-exact-alarms).

#### Managed Home Screen notifications<!-- 19805777  -->  
For Android devices running Android 13 or higher that target API level 33, by default, applications don't have permission to send notifications. In previous versions of Managed Home Screen, when an admin had enabled automatic relaunch of Managed Home Screen, a notification was displayed to alert users of the relaunch. To accommodate change to notification permission, in the scenario when an admin has enabled auto-relaunch of Managed Home Screen, the application will now display a toast message alerting users of the relaunch. Managed Home Screen is able to auto-grant permission for this notification, so no change is required for admins configuring Managed Home Screen to accommodate the change in notification permission with API level 33. For more information about Android 13 (API level 33) notification messages, see the [Android developer documentation](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/views/notifications/notification-permission). For more information about Managed Home Screen, see [Configure the Microsoft Managed Home Screen app for Android Enterprise](../apps/app-configuration-managed-home-screen-app.md).

### Device enrollment

#### Just-in-time registration and compliance remediation for iOS/iPadOS Setup Assistant with modern authentication now generally available<!-- 16276610 -->

Just in time (JIT) registration and compliance remediation for Setup Assistant with modern authentication are now out of preview and generally available. With just in time registration, the device user doesn't need to use the Company Portal app for Microsoft Entra registration and compliance checking. JIT registration and compliance remediation are embedded into the user's provisioning experience, so they can view their compliance status and take action within the work app they're trying to access. Also, this establishes single-sign on across the device. For more information about how to set up JIT registration, see [Set up Just in Time Registration](../enrollment/automated-device-enrollment-authentication.md).

#### Awaiting final configuration for iOS/iPadOS automated device enrollment now generally available<!-- 17473384  -->  
Now generally available, *awaiting final configuration* enables a locked experience at the end of Setup Assistant to ensure that critical device configuration policies install on devices. The locked experience works on devices targeted with new and existing enrollment profiles. Supported devices include:

- iOS/iPadOS 13+ devices enrolling with Setup Assistant with modern authentication
- iOS/iPadOS 13+ devices enrolling without user affinity  
- iOS/iPadOS 13+ devices enrolling with Microsoft Entra ID shared mode  

This setting is applied once during the out-of-box automated device enrollment experience in Setup Assistant. The device user doesn't experience it again unless they re-enroll their device.  Awaiting final configuration is enabled by default for new enrollment profiles. For information about how to enable awaiting final configuration, see [Create an Apple enrollment profile](..//enrollment/device-enrollment-program-enroll-ios.md#create-an-apple-enrollment-profile).

### Device management

#### Changes to Android notification permission prompt behavior<!-- 19783177  -->  
We've updated how our Android apps handle notification permissions to align with recent changes made by Google to the Android platform.  As a result of Google changes, notification permissions are granted to apps as follows:

- **On devices running Android 12 and earlier**: Apps are permitted to send notifications to users by default.
- **On devices running Android 13 and later**: Notification permissions vary depending on the API the app targets.
  - *Apps targeting API 32 and lower*: Google has added a notification permission prompt that appears when the user opens the app. Management apps can still configure apps so that they're automatically granted notification permissions.
  - *Apps targeting API 33 and higher*: App developers define when the notification permission prompts appear. Management apps can still configure apps so that they're automatically granted notification permissions.

You and your device users can expect to see the following changes now that our apps target API 33:

- **Company Portal used for work profile management**: Users see a notification permission prompt in the personal instance of the Company Portal when they first open it. Users don't see a notification permission prompt in the work profile instance of Company Portal because notification permissions are automatically permitted for Company Portal in the work profile. Users can silence app notifications in the Settings app.
- **Company Portal used for device administrator management**: Users see a notification permission prompt when they first open the Company Portal app.  Users can adjust app notification settings in the Settings app.
- **Microsoft Intune app**: No changes to existing behavior. Users don't see a prompt because notifications are automatically permitted for the Microsoft Intune app.  Users can adjust some app notification settings in the Settings app.
- **Microsoft Intune app for AOSP**: No changes to existing behavior. Users don't see a prompt because notifications are automatically permitted for the Microsoft Intune app.  Users can't adjust app notification settings in the Settings app.

### Device security

#### Defender Update controls to deploy updates for Defender is now generally available<!-- 24666660 -->  
The profile **Defender Update controls** for Intune Endpoint security Antivirus policy, which manages update settings for Microsoft Defender, is now generally available. This profile is available for the *Windows 10, Windows 11, and Windows Server* platform. While in public preview, this profile was available for the *Windows 10 and later* platform.

The profile includes settings for the rollout release channel by which devices and users receive Defender Updates that are related to daily security intelligence updates, monthly platform updates, and monthly engine updates.

This profile includes the following settings, which are all directly taken from [Defender CSP - Windows Client Management](/windows/client-management/mdm/policy-csp-Defender).

- Engine Updates Channel
- Platform Updates Channel
- Security Intelligence Updates Channel

These settings are also available from the [settings catalog](../configuration/settings-catalog.md) for the *Windows 10 and later* profile.

#### Elevation report by applications for Endpoint Privilege Management<!-- 24593324 -->  
We've released a new report named **Elevation report by applications** for Endpoint Privilege Management (EPM). With [this new report](../protect/epm-reports.md#elevation-report-by-applications) you can view all managed and unmanaged elevations, which are aggregated by the application that elevated. This report can aid you in identifying applications that might require elevation rules to function properly, including rules for child processes.

You'll find the report in the Report node for EPM in the [Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431). Navigate to **Endpoint security** > **Endpoint Privilege Management** and then select the **Reports** tab.

#### New settings available for macOS Antivirus policy<!-- 24191427 -->  
The [Microsoft Defender Antivirus](../protect/endpoint-security-antivirus-policy.md) profile for macOS devices has been updated with nine more settings, and three new settings categories:

**Antivirus engine** – The following settings are new in this category:

- **Degree of parallelism for on-demand scans** – Specifies the degree of parallelism for on-demand scans. This setting corresponds to the number of threads used to perform the scan and impacts the CPU usage, and the duration of the on-demand scan.
- **Enable file hash computation** – Enables or disables file hash computation feature. When this feature is enabled, Windows Defender computes hashes for files it scans. This setting helps improve the accuracy of Custom Indicator matches. However, enabling Enable file hash computation can impact device performance.
- **Run a scan after definitions are updated** – Specifies whether to start a process scan after new security intelligence updates are downloaded on the device. Enabling this setting triggers an antivirus scan on the running processes of the device.
- **Scanning inside archive files** – If true, Defender unpacks archives and scan files inside them. Otherwise archive content is skipped, which improves scanning performance.

**Network protection** – A new category that includes the following setting:

- **Enforcement level** – Configure this setting to specify if network protection is *disabled*, *in audit mode*, or *enforced*.

**Tamper  protection** - A new category that includes the following setting:

- **Enforcement level** - Specify whether tamper protection is *disabled*, in *audit mode*, or *enforced*.

**User interface preferences** – A new category that includes the following settings:

- **Control sign-in to consumer version** - Specify whether users can sign into the consumer version of Microsoft Defender.
- **Show / hide status menu icon** – Specify whether the status menu icon (shown in the top-right corner of the screen) is hidden or not.
- **User initiated feedback** – Specify whether users can submit feedback to Microsoft by going to *Help* > *Send Feedback*.

New profiles that you create include the original settings and the new settings. Your existing profiles automatically update to include the new settings, with each new setting set to *Not configured* until you choose to edit that profile to change it.

For more information about how to set preferences for Microsoft Defender for Endpoint on macOS in enterprise organizations, see [Set preferences for Microsoft Defender for Endpoint on macOS](/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/mac-preferences?view=o365-worldwide&preserve-view=true).

### Intune apps

The Intune remote action to [collect diagnostics](../remote-actions/collect-diagnostics.md) from a Windows device now includes data in a log file.

Log file:
- %temp%\CloudDesktop\*.log

#### Anomaly detection device cohorts in Intune Endpoint analytics is generally available<!-- 24577118  -->  
Anomaly detection device cohorts in Intune Endpoint analytics is now generally available.

Device cohorts are identified in devices associated with a high or medium severity anomaly. Devices are correlated into groups based on one or more factors they have in common like an app version, driver update, OS version, device model. A correlation group will contain a detailed view with key information about the common factors between all affected devices in that group. You can also view a breakdown of devices currently affected by the anomaly and 'at risk' devices. "At risk" devices haven't yet shown symptoms of the anomaly.

For more information, see [Anomaly detection in Endpoint analytics](../../analytics/anomaly-detection.md#anomalies-tab).

#### Improved user experience for device timeline in Endpoint Analytics<!-- 24604944 -->  
The user interface (UI) for device timeline in Endpoint analytics is improved and includes more advanced capabilities (support for sorting, searching, filtering, and exports). When viewing a specific device timeline in Endpoint analytics, you can search by event name or details. You can also filter the events and choose the source and level of events that appear on the device timeline and select a time range of interest.

For more information, see [Enhanced device timeline](../../analytics/enhanced-device-timeline.md).

#### Updates for compliance policies and reports<!--15425771  -->  
We've made several improvements to the Intune compliance policies and reports. With these changes, the reports more closely align to the experience in use for device configuration profiles and reports. We've updated our [compliance report documentation](../protect/compliance-policy-monitor.md) to reflect the available compliance report improvements.

Compliance report improvements include:

- Compliance details for Linux devices.
- Redesigned reports that are up-to-date and simplified, with newer report versions beginning to replace older report versions, which will remain available for some time.
- When viewing a policy for compliance, there isn't a left-pane navigation. Instead, the policy view opens to a single pane that defaults to the Monitor tab and its Device status view.
  - This view provides a high-level overview of device status for this policy, supports drilling in to review the full report, and a per-setting status view of the same policy.
  - The doughnut chart is replaced by a streamlined representation and count of the different device status values returned by devices assigned the policy.
  - You can select the Properties tab to view the policy details, and review and edit its configuration and assignments.
  - The *Essentials* section is removed with those details appearing in the policy's *Properties* tab.
- The updated status reports support sorting by columns, the use of filters, and search. Combined, these enhancements enable you to pivot the report to display specific subsets of details you want to view at that time. With these enhancements, we have removed the *User status* report as it has become redundant. Now, while viewing the default *Device status* report you can focus the report to display the same information that was available from *User status* by sorting on the *User Principal Name* column, or searching for a specific username in the search box.
- When viewing status reports, the count of devices that Intune displays now remains consistent between different report views as you drill in for deeper insights or details.

For more information about these changes, see the Intune Support Team blog at [https://aka.ms/Intune/device_compl_report](https://aka.ms/Intune/device_compl_report).

### App management

#### Use the Turn off the Store application setting to disable end user access to Store apps, and allow managed Intune Store apps<!-- 16544362 -->  
In Intune, you can use the new **Store app** type to deploy Store apps to your devices.

Now, you can use the **Turn off the Store application** policy to disable end users' direct access to Store apps. When it's disabled, end users can still access and install Store apps from the Windows Company Portal app and through Intune app management. If you want to allow random store app installs outside of Intune, then don't configure this policy.

The previous **Only display the private store within the Microsoft Store app** policy doesn't prevent end users from directly accessing the store using the Windows Package Manager `winget` APIs. So, if your goal is to block random unmanaged Store application installs on client devices, then it's recommended to use the **Turn off the Store application** policy. Don't use the **Only display the private store within the Microsoft Store app** policy
.
Applies to:

- Windows 10 and later

For more information, see [Add Microsoft Store Apps to Microsoft Intune](../apps/store-apps-microsoft.md).

## Week of August 7, 2023

#### Compliance Retrieval service support for MAC address endpoints<!--  24332824  -->  
We've now added MAC address support to the Compliance Retrieval service.

The initial release of the CR service included support for using only the Intune device ID with the intent to eliminate the need to manage internal identifiers like serial numbers and MAC addresses. With this update, organizations that prefer to use MAC addresses over certificate authentication can continue to do so while implementing the CR service.

While this update adds MAC address support to the CR service, our recommendation is to use certificate-based authentication with the Intune device ID included in the certificate.

For information about the CR service as a replacement for the Intune Network Access Control (NAC) service, see the Intune blog at [https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/intune-customer-success/new-microsoft-intune-service-for-network-access-control/ba-p/2544696](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/intune-customer-success/new-microsoft-intune-service-for-network-access-control/ba-p/2544696).

Announcing the general availability of Settings insight in Microsoft Intune.

The [Settings insight](../fundamentals/settings-insight.md) feature adds insight to settings giving you confidence in configurations that have been successfully adopted by similar organizations. Settings insight is currently available for security baselines.

Navigate to **Endpoint security** > **Security baselines**. While creating and editing a workflow, these insights are available for all settings with light bulbs.

### Device security

#### Tamper protection support for Windows on Azure Virtual Desktop<!--15135590  -->  
Intune now supports use of endpoint security [Antivirus policy](../protect/endpoint-security-antivirus-policy.md#prerequisites-for-tamper-protection) to manage *Tamper protection* for Windows on Azure Virtual Desktop multi-session devices. Support for Tamper protection requires devices to onboard to Microsoft Defender for Endpoint before the policy that enables Tamper protection is applied.

#### EpmTools PowerShell module for Endpoint Privilege Management<!-- 22800379  -->  
The EpmTools PowerShell module is now available for use with Intune Endpoint Privilege Management (EPM). EpmTools includes the cmdlets like **Get-FileAttributes** that you can use to retrieve file details to help build accurate elevation rules, and other cmdlets you can use to troubleshoot or diagnose EPM policy deployments.

For more information, see [EpmTools PowerShell module](../protect/epm-overview.md#epmtools-powershell-module).

#### Endpoint Privilege Management support to manage elevation rules for child processes<!-- 15931887 -->  
With Intune Endpoint Privilege Management (EPM) you can manage which files and processes are allowed to *Run as Administrator* on your Windows devices.  Now, EPM [elevation rules](../protect/epm-policies.md#create-a-windows-elevation-rules-policy) support a new setting, **Child process behavior**.

With *Child process behavior*, your rules can manage the elevation context for any child processes created by the managed process. Options include:

- Allowing all child processes created by the managed process to always run as elevated.
- Allow a child process to run as elevated only when it matches the rule that manages its parent process.
- Deny all child processes from running in an elevated context, in which case they run as standard users.

Endpoint Privilege Management is available as an Intune add-on. For more information, see [Use Intune Suite add-on capabilities](../fundamentals/intune-add-ons.md).

### Intune apps

#### Newly available protected app for Intune<!-- 24323519  -->  
The following protected app is now available for Microsoft Intune:

- Dooray! for Intune

For more information about protected apps, see [Microsoft Intune protected apps](../apps/apps-supported-intune-apps.md).

### Monitor and troubleshoot

#### Updated reports for Setting compliance and Policy compliance are in public preview<!-- 15425624, 15425656  -->  
We've released two new reports as a public preview for Intune device compliance. You can find these new preview reports in the Intune admin center at **Reports** > **Device compliance** > *Reports* tab:

- [Setting compliance (preview)](../fundamentals/reports.md)
- [Policy compliance (preview)](../fundamentals/reports.md)

Both reports are new instances of existing reports, and deliver improvements over the older versions, including:  

- Details for Linux settings and devices
- Support for sorting, searching, filtering, exports, and paging views
- Drill-down reports for deeper details, which are filtered based on the column you select.
- Devices are represented a single time. This behavior is in contrast to the original reports, which could count a device more than once if multiple users used that device.

Eventually, the [older report versions](../protect/compliance-policy-monitor.md#other-compliance-reports) that are still available in the admin center at *Devices > Monitor* will be retired.

### Device management

#### Intune support for Zebra devices on Android 13<!-- 17192763 -->  
Zebra will be releasing support for Android 13 on their devices. You can read more at [Migrating to Android 13](https://techdocs.zebra.com/lifeguard/a13/) (opens Zebra's web site).

- **Temporary issues on Android 13**

  The Intune team thoroughly tested Android 13 on Zebra devices. Everything continues working as normal, except for the following two temporary issues for device administrator (DA) devices.

  For Zebra devices running Android 13 and enrolled with DA management:

  1. App installations don't happen silently. Instead, users get a notification from the Company Portal app (if they allow notifications) that asks for permission to allow the app installation. If a user doesn't accept the app installation when prompted, then the app doesn't install. Users will have a persistent notification in the notification drawer until they allow the installation.

  2. New MX profiles don't apply to Android 13 devices. Newly enrolled Android 13 devices don't receive configuration from MX profiles. MX profiles that previously applied to enrolled devices continue to apply.

  In an update coming later in July, these issues will be resolved and the behavior will return to how it was before.

- **Update devices to Android 13**

  You'll soon be able to use Intune's Zebra LifeGuard Over-the-Air integration to update Android Enterprise dedicated and fully managed devices to Android 13. For more information, see [Zebra LifeGuard Over-the-Air Integration with Microsoft Intune](../protect/zebra-lifeguard-ota-integration.md).

  Before you migrate to Android 13, review [Migrating to Android 13](https://techdocs.zebra.com/lifeguard/a13/) (opens Zebra's web site).

- **OEMConfig for Zebra devices on Android 13**

  OEMConfig for Zebra devices on Android 13 requires using Zebra's new [Zebra OEMConfig Powered by MX OEMConfig app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.zebra.oemconfig.release) (opens the Google Play store). This new app can also be used on Zebra devices running Android 11, but not earlier versions.

  For more information on this app, go to the [New Zebra OEMConfig app for Android 11 and later](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/intune-customer-success/new-zebra-oemconfig-app-for-android-11-and-later/ba-p/3846730) blog post.

  The [Legacy Zebra OEMConfig app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.zebra.oemconfig.common) (opens the Google Play store) can only be used on Zebra devices running Android 11 and earlier.

For more general information about Intune Android 13 support, go to the [Day Zero support for Android 13 with Microsoft Intune](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/intune-customer-success/day-zero-support-for-android-13-with-microsoft-intune/ba-p/3601760) blog post.

### Device security

#### Defender for Endpoint security settings management enhancements and support for Linux and macOS in public preview<!-- 14743017, 15319901, 18713045, 18713050, 17757959 17757967, 17758270  -->  
With [Defender for Endpoint security settings management](../protect/mde-security-integration.md), you can use Intune's endpoint security policies to manage Defender security settings on devices that onboard to Defender for Endpoint but aren't enrolled with Intune.

Now, you can opt in to a public preview from within the Microsoft Defender portal to gain access to several enhancements for this scenario:

- Intune's endpoint security policies become visible in and can be managed from within the Microsoft Defender portal. This enables security admins to remain in the Defender portal to manage Defender and the Intune endpoint security policies for Defender security settings management.

- Security settings management supports deploying Intune endpoint security Antivirus policies to devices that run Linux and macOS.

- For Windows devices, the Windows Security Experience profile is now supported with security settings management.

- A new onboarding workflow removes the Microsoft Entra hybrid join prerequisite. Microsoft Entra hybrid join requirements prevented many Windows devices from successfully onboarding to Defender for Endpoint security settings management. With this change, those devices can now complete enrollment and start processing policies for security settings management.

- Intune creates a synthetic registration in Microsoft Entra ID for devices that can't fully register with Microsoft Entra ID. Synthetic registrations are device objects created in Microsoft Entra ID that enable devices to receive and report back on Intune policies for security settings management. In addition, should a device with a synthetic registration become fully registered, the synthetic registration is removed from Microsoft Entra ID in deference to the full registration.

If you don't opt in to the Defender for Endpoint Public Preview, the previous behaviors remain in place. In this case, while you can view the Antivirus profiles for Linux, you can't deploy it as its supported only for devices managed by Defender. Similarly, the macOS profile that's currently available for devices enrolled with Intune can't be deployed to devices managed by Defender.

Applies to:

- Linux
- macOS
- Windows

### Device management

#### Windows Driver update management in Intune is generally available<!-- 5584639  -->  
Announcing the general availability of **Windows Driver update management** in Microsoft Intune. With driver update policies, you can view a list of driver updates that are recommended and applicable to your Windows 10 and Windows 11 device that are assigned to the policy. Applicable driver updates are those that can update a device's driver version. Driver update policies update automatically to add new updates as they're published by the driver manufacturer and remove older drivers that no longer apply to any device with the policy.

Update policies can be configured for one of two approval methods:

- With *Automatic approval*, each new *recommended* driver that's published by the driver manufacturer and added to the policy is automatically approved for deployment to applicable devices. Policies set for automatic approvals can be configured with a deferral period before the automatically approved updates are installed on devices. This deferral gives you time to review the driver and to pause its deployment if necessary.

- With *manual approval*, all new driver updates are automatically added to the policy, but an admin must explicitly approve each update before Windows Update deploys it to a device. When you manually approve an update, you choose the date when Windows Update will begin to deploy it to your devices.

To help you manage driver updates, you review a policy and decline an update you don't want to install. You can also indefinitely pause any approved update, and reapprove a paused update to restart its deployment.

This release also includes [driver update reports](../protect/windows-update-reports.md#reports-for-windows-driver-updates-policy) that provide a success summary, per-device update status for each approved driver, and error and troubleshooting information. You can also select an individual driver update and view details about it across all the policies that include that driver version.

To learn about using Windows Driver update policies, see [Manage policy for Windows Driver updates with Microsoft Intune](../protect/windows-driver-updates-overview.md).

Applies to:

- Windows 10

### Device management

#### New endpoint security Application Control policy in preview<!-- 15711976 -->  
As a public preview, you can use a new endpoint security policy category, Application Control. Endpoint security Application Control policy includes:

- Policy to set the Intune Management Extension as a tenant-wide managed installer. When enabled as a managed installer, apps you deploy through Intune (after enablement of Managed Installer) to Windows devices are tagged as installed by Intune. This tag becomes useful when you use Application Control policies to manage which apps you want to allow or block from running on your managed devices.

- Application Control policies that are an implementation of Defender Application Control (WDAC). With Endpoint security Application Control policies, it's easy to configure policy that allows trusted apps to run on your managed devices. Trusted apps are installed by a managed installer or from the App store. In addition to built-in trust settings, these policies also support custom XML for application control so you can allow other apps from other sources to run to meet your organizations requirements.

To get started with using this new policy type, see [Manage approved apps for Windows devices with Application Control policy and Managed Installers for Microsoft Intune](../protect/endpoint-security-app-control-policy.md)

#### Visual Studio ADMX settings are in the Settings Catalog and Administrative Templates <!-- 10875730 -->  
Visual Studio settings are included in the Settings Catalog and Administrative Templates (ADMX). Previously, to configure Visual Studio settings on Windows devices, you imported them with ADMX import.

For more information on these policy types, see:

- [Use the settings catalog to configure settings](../configuration/settings-catalog.md)
- [Use Windows 10/11 templates to configure group policy settings in Microsoft Intune](../configuration/administrative-templates-windows.md)

#### Group policy analytics supports scope tags<!-- 12714882  -->  
In Group Policy analytics, you import your on-premises GPO. The tool analyzes your GPOs and shows the settings that can (and can't) be used in Intune.

When you import your GPO XML file in Intune, you can select an existing scope tag. If you don't select a scope tag, then the **Default** scope tag is automatically selected. Previously, when you imported a GPO, the scope tags assigned to you were automatically applied to the GPO.

Only admins within that scope tag can see the imported policies. Admins not in that scope tag can't see the imported policies.

Also, admins within their scope tag can migrate the imported policies that they have permissions to see. To migrate an imported GPO into a Settings Catalog policy, a scope tag must be associated with the imported GPO. If a scope tag isn't associated, then it can't migrate to a Settings Catalog policy. If no scope tag is selected, then a default scope tag is automatically applied.

For more information on scope tags and Group Policy analytics, see:

- [Analyze your on-premises GPOs using Group Policy analytics in Microsoft Intune](../configuration/group-policy-analytics.md)
- [Create a Settings Catalog policy using your imported GPOs](../configuration/group-policy-analytics-migrate.md)

Devices running iOS/iPadOS, version 14.8.1 and earlier remain unaffected by this update and can continue to use the existing method. For more information, see [Set up account driven Apple User Enrollment](../enrollment/apple-account-driven-user-enrollment.md).  

### Device security

#### New security baseline for Microsoft 365 Office Apps<!-- 9587103  -->  
We've released a new security baseline to help you manage security configurations for **M365 Office Apps**. This new baseline uses an updated template and experience that uses the unified settings platform seen in the Intune settings catalog. You can view the list of settings in the new baseline at [Microsoft 365 Apps for Enterprise baseline settings (Office)](../protect/security-baseline-v2-office-settings.md).

The new Intune security baseline format aligns the presentation of settings that are available to the settings found in the Intune settings catalog. This alignment helps resolve past issues for setting names and implementations for settings that could create conflicts. The new format also improves the reporting experience for baselines in the Intune admin center.

The Microsoft 365 Office Apps baseline can help you rapidly deploy configurations to your Office Apps that meet the security recommendations of the Office and security teams at Microsoft. As with all baselines, the default baseline represents the recommended configurations. You can modify the default baseline to meet the requirements of your organization.

To learn more, see [Security baselines overview](../protect/security-baselines.md).

Applies to:

- Windows 10
- Windows 11

#### Security baseline update for Microsoft Edge version 112<!-- 3408610  -->  
We've released a new version of the Intune security baseline for Microsoft Edge, version 112. In addition to releasing this new version for Microsoft Edge, the new baseline uses an updated template experience that uses the unified settings platform seen in the Intune settings catalog. You can view the list of settings in the new baseline at [Microsoft Edge baseline settings (version 112 and higher)](../protect/security-baseline-v2-edge-settings.md).

The new Intune security baseline format aligns the presentation of settings that are available to the settings found in the Intune settings catalog. This alignment helps resolve past issues for setting names and implementations for settings that could create conflicts. The new format also improves the reporting experience for baselines in the Intune admin center.

Now that the new baseline version is available, all new profiles you create for Microsoft Edge use the new baseline format and version. While the new version becomes the default baseline version, you can continue to use the profiles you've previously created for older versions of Microsoft Edge. But, you can't create new profiles for those older versions of Microsoft Edge.

To learn more, see [Security baselines overview](../protect/security-baselines.md).

### App management

#### Changes to iCloud app backup and restore behavior on iOS/iPadOS and macOS devices<!-- 16261392  -->  
As an app setting, you can select to **Prevent iCloud app backup** for iOS/iPadOS and macOS devices. You can *not* backup managed App Store apps and line-of-business (LOB) apps on iOS/iPadOS, as well as managed App Store apps on macOS devices (macOS LOB apps don't support this feature), for both user and device licensed VPP/non-VPP apps. This update includes both new and existing App Store/LOB apps sent with and without VPP that are being added to Intune and targeted to users and devices.

Preventing the backup of the specified managed apps ensures that these apps can be properly deployed via Intune when the device is enrolled and restored from backup. If the admin configures this new setting for new or existing apps in their tenant, then managed apps can and will be reinstalled for devices. But, Intune doesn't allow them to be backed up.

#### Manage Windows LAPS with Intune policies (public preview)<!-- 11890571  -->  
Now available in a public preview, manage Windows Local Administrator Password Solution (Windows LAPS) with Microsoft Intune [Account protection policies](../protect/endpoint-security-account-protection-policy.md). To get started, see [Intune support for Windows LAPS](../protect/windows-laps-overview.md).

[Windows LAPS](/windows-server/identity/laps/laps-overview) is a Windows feature that allows you to manage and backs up the password of a local administrator account on your Microsoft Entra joined or Windows Server Active Directory-joined devices.

To manage LAPS, Intune configures the Windows [LAPS configuration service provider](/windows/client-management/mdm/LAPS-csp) (CSP) that is built in to Windows devices. It takes precedence over other sources of Windows LAPS configurations, like GPOs or the Microsoft Legacy LAPS tool. Some of the capabilities you can use when Intune manages Windows LAPS include:

- Define password requirements like complexity and length that apply to the local administrator accounts on a device.
- Configure devices to rotate their local admin account passwords on a schedule. And, back up the account and password in your Microsoft Entra ID or on-premises Active Directory.
- Use an Intune device action from the admin center to manually rotate the password for an account on your own schedule.
- View account details from within the Intune admin center, like the account name and password. This information can help you recover devices that are otherwise inaccessible.
- Use Intune reports to monitor your LAPS policies, and when devices last rotated passwords manually or by schedule.  

Applies to:

- Windows 10
- Windows 11

#### New settings available for macOS software update policies<!-- 16646756  -->

The Microsoft Surface link takes you to the Surface Management Portal where you can get insights into device compliance, support activity, and warranty coverage.

To access the Partner portals page, you must enable the Devices pane preview and then navigate to **Devices** > **Partner Portals**.

#### Windows Update compatibility reports for Apps and Drivers are now generally available<!-- 17917026  -->  
The following Microsoft Intune reports for [Windows Update compatibility](../protect/windows-update-compatibility-reports.md) are out of preview and now generally available:

- **Windows feature update device readiness report** - This report provides per-device information about compatibility risks that are associated with an upgrade or update to a chosen version of Windows.

- **Windows feature update compatibility risks report** - This report provides a summary view of the top compatibility risks across your organization for a chosen version of Windows. You can use this report to understand which compatibility risks impact the greatest number of devices in your organization.

These reports can help you plan an upgrade from Windows 10 to 11, or for installing the latest Windows feature update.

### Device security

#### Microsoft Intune Endpoint Privilege Management is generally available<!--1564177  -->  
Microsoft Endpoint Privilege Management (EPM) is now generally available and no longer in preview.

With [Endpoint Privilege Management](../protect/epm-overview.md), admins can set policies that allow standard users to perform tasks normally reserved for an administrator. To do so, you configure policies for *automatic* and *user-confirmed* workflows that elevate the run-time permissions for apps or processes you select. You then assign these policies to users or devices that have end users running without Administrator privileges. After the device receives a policy, EPM brokers the elevation on behalf of the user, allowing them to elevate approved applications without needing full administrator privileges. EPM also includes built-in insights and reporting.

Now that EPM is out of preview, it requires another license to use. You can choose between a stand-alone license that adds only EPM, or license EPM as part of the Microsoft Intune Suite. For more information, see [Use Intune Suite add-on capabilities](../fundamentals/intune-add-ons.md).

While Endpoint Privilege Management is now generally available, the [reports for EPM](../protect/epm-reports.md) will transition to a feature in *preview*, and will receive some more enhancements before being removed from preview.

#### Support for WDAC Application ID tagging with Intune Firewall Rules policy<!-- 17224780  -->  
Intune's *Microsoft Defender Firewall Rules* profiles, which are available as part of [endpoint security Firewall policy](../protect/endpoint-security-firewall-policy.md), now include the Policy App ID setting. This setting is described in the [*MdmStore/FirewallRules/{FirewallRuleName}/PolicyAppId*](/windows/client-management/mdm/Firewall-csp?WT.mc_id=Portal-fx#mdmstorefirewallrulesfirewallrulenamepolicyappid) CSP and supports specifying a Windows Defender Application Control (WDAC) Application ID tag.

With this capability, you can scope your firewall rules to an application or a group of applications and rely on your WDAC policies to define those applications. By using tags to link to and rely on WDAC policies, your Firewall Rules policy won't need to rely on the firewall rules option of an absolute file path, or use of a variable file path that can reduce security of the rule.

Use of this capability requires you to have WDAC policies in place that include *AppId* tags that you can then specify in your Intune Microsoft Defender Firewall Rules.

For more information, see the following articles in the Windows Defender Application Control documentation:

- [About application control for Windows](/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-defender-application-control/windows-defender-application-control)
- [WDAC Application ID (AppId) Tagging guide](/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-defender-application-control/appidtagging/windows-defender-application-control-appid-tagging-guide)

### Device security

#### Microsoft Intune Endpoint Privilege Management (public preview)<!-- 15654169   -->  
As a public preview, you can now use Microsoft Intune Endpoint Privilege Management. With Endpoint Privilege Management, admins can set policies that allow standard users to perform tasks normally reserved for an administrator. Endpoint Privilege Management can be configured in the [Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431) at **Endpoint security** > **Endpoint Privilege Management**.

With the public preview, you can configure policies for *automatic* and *user-confirmed* workflows that elevate the run-time permissions for apps or processes you select. You then assign these policies to users or devices that have end users running without Administrator privileges. Once policy is received, Endpoint Privilege Management will broker the elevation on behalf of the user, allowing them to elevate approved applications without needing full administrator privileges. The preview also includes built-in insights and reporting for Endpoint Privilege Management.

To learn how to activate the public preview and use Endpoint Privilege Management policies, start with [Use Endpoint Privilege Management with Microsoft Intune](../protect/epm-overview.md).

### App management

#### Trusted Root Certificates Management for Intune App SDK for Android<!-- 15135752 -->  
If your Android application requires SSL/TLS certificates issued by an on-premises or private certificate authority to provide secure access to internal websites and applications, the Intune App SDK for Android now has support for certificate trust management. For more information and examples, see [Trusted Root Certificates Management](../developer/app-sdk-android-phase7.md#trusted-root-certificates-management).

#### System context support for UWP apps<!-- 16544103 -->  
In addition to user context, you can deploy Universal Windows Platform (UWP) apps from the **Microsoft Store app (new)** in system context. If a provisioned *.appx* app is deployed in system context, the app auto-installs for each user that logs in. If an individual end user uninstalls the user context app, the app still shows as installed because it's still provisioned. In addition, the app must not already be installed for any users on the device. Our general recommendation is to not mix install contexts when deploying apps. Win32 apps from the **Microsoft Store app (new)** already support system context.

### Tenant administration

#### Access policies for multiple Administrator Approval (public preview)<!-- 9348867  -->  
In public preview, you can use Intune *access policies* to require that a second Administrator Approval account approve a change before the change is applied. This capability is known as multiple Administrator Approval (MAA).

You create an access policy to protect a type of resource, like App deployments. Each access policy also includes a group of users who are *approvers* for the changes protected by the policy. When a resource, like an app deployment configuration, is protected by an access policy, any changes that made to the deployment, including creating, deleting, or modifying an existing deployment, won't apply until a member of the approvers group for that access policy reviews and approves that change.

Approvers can also reject requests. The individual requesting a change and the approver can provide notes about the change, or why it was approved or rejected.

Access policies are supported for the following resources:

- **Apps** – Applies to [app deployments](../apps/apps-add.md), but doesn't apply to app protection policies.
- **Scripts** – Applies to deploying scripts to devices that run [macOS](../apps/macos-shell-scripts.md) or [Windows](../apps/intune-management-extension.md).

- Secure access to on-premises apps and resources using modern authentication
- Single Sign On and conditional access

To use Tunnel MAM, unenrolled devices must install Microsoft Edge, Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, and the Company Portal. You can then use the Microsoft Intune admin center to configure the following profiles for the unenrolled devices:

- An App configuration profile for managed apps, to configure Microsoft Defender on devices for use as the Tunnel client app.
- A second App configuration profile for managed apps, to configure Microsoft Edge to connect to Tunnel.

### App management

#### Use filters with app configuration policies for managed devices<!-- 7423842  -->  
You can use filters to refine the assignment scope when deploying app configuration policies for managed devices. You must first [create a filter](../fundamentals/filters.md#create-a-filter) using any of the available properties for iOS and Android. Then, in [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431) you can assign your managed app configuration policy by selecting **Apps** > **App configuration policies** > **Add** > **Managed devices** and go to the assignment page. After selecting a group, you can refine the applicability of the policy by choosing a filter and deciding to use it in **Include** or **Exclude** mode. For related information about filters, see [Use filters when assigning your apps, policies, and profiles in Microsoft Intune admin center](../fundamentals/filters.md).

### Device configuration

#### Group Policy analytics automatically applies scope tags assigned to admins when they import Group Policy objects<!-- 16017499 -->  
In Group Policy analytics, you can import your on-premises GPOs to see the policy settings that support cloud-based MDM providers, including Microsoft Intune. You can also see any deprecated settings or settings not available.

Now, scope tags assigned to admins are automatically applied when these admins import GPOs into Group Policy analytics.

For example, admins have **Charlotte**, **London**, or **Boston** scope tags assigned to their role:

- An admin with the **Charlotte** scope tag imports a GPO. 
- The **Charlotte** scope tag is automatically applied to the imported GPO.
- All admins with the **Charlotte** scope tag can see the imported object.
- Admins with only the **London** or only the **Boston** scope tags can't see the imported object from the **Charlotte** admin.

For admins to see the analytics or migrate the imported GPO to an Intune policy, these admins must have one of the same scope tags as the admin that did the import.

For more information on these features, go to:

- [Analyze your on-premises GPOs using Group Policy analytics in Microsoft Intune](../configuration/group-policy-analytics.md)
- [Use role-based access control (RBAC) and scope tags for distributed IT](scope-tags.md)

For more information, go to [View device details with Microsoft Intune](../remote-actions/device-inventory.md).

Applies to

- iOS/iPadOS

#### Use the `$null` value in filters<!-- 11030128  -->  
When you assign apps and policies to groups, you can use filters to assign a policy based on rules you create (**Tenant administration** > **Filters** > **Create**). These rules use different device properties, such as category or the enrollment profile.

Now, you can use the `$null` value with the `-Equals` and `-NotEquals` operators.

For example, use the `$null` value in the following scenarios:

- You want to target all devices that don't have a category assigned to the device.
- You want to target devices that don't have an enrollment profile property assigned to the device.

For more information on filters and the rules you can create, go to:

- [Use filters when assigning your apps, policies, and profiles in Microsoft Intune](filters.md)
- [Device properties, operators, and rule editing when creating filters in Microsoft Intune](filters-device-properties.md)

### Device security

#### Reusable groups of settings for removable storage in Device Control profiles (preview) <!-- 7351534 -->  
In public preview, you can use [reusable groups of settings](../protect/reusable-settings-groups.md) with [device control profiles](../protect/endpoint-security-asr-policy.md#reusable-settings-groups-for-device-control-profiles) in your attack surface reduction policies.

The reusable groups for device control profiles include a collection of settings that support managing *read*, *write*, and *execute* access for removable storage. Examples of common scenarios include:

- Prevent write and execute access to all but allow specific approved USBs
- Audit write and execute access to all but block specific unapproved USBs
- Only allow specific user groups to access specific removable storage on a shared PC

Applies to:  
- Windows 10 or later

#### Reusable groups of settings for Microsoft Defender Firewall Rules (preview) <!-- 5653346, 6009541 -->  
In public preview, you can use [reusable groups of settings](../protect/reusable-settings-groups.md) that you can use with [profiles for Microsoft Defender Firewall Rules](../protect/endpoint-security-firewall-policy.md#add-reusable-settings-groups-to-profiles-for-firewall-rules). The reusable groups are collections of remote IP addresses and FQDNs that you define one time and can then use with one or more firewall rule profiles. You don't need to reconfigure the same group of IP addresses in each individual profile that might require them.

Features of the reusable settings groups include:

- Add one or more remote IP addresses.

- Add one or more FQDNs that can auto resolve to the remote IP address, or for one or more simple keywords when auto resolve for the group is off.

- Use each settings group with one or more firewall rule profiles and the different  profiles can support different access configurations for the group.

  For example, you can create two firewall rule profiles that reference the same reusable settings group and assign each profile to a different group of devices. The first profile can block access to all the remote IP addresses in the reusable settings group, while the second profile can be configured to allow access.

- Edits to a settings group that's in use are automatically applied to all Firewall Rules profiles that use that group.  

#### Attack surface reduction rule exclusions on a per-rule basis<!-- 13385644   -->  
You can now [configure per-rule exclusions for Attack surface reduction rules policies](../protect/endpoint-security-asr-policy.md#exclusions-for-attack-surface-reduction-rules). Per-rule exclusions are enabled through a new per-rule setting **ASR Only Per Rule Exclusions**.

When you create or edit attack surface reduction rule policies and change a setting that supports exclusions from the default of *Not configured* to any of the other available options, the new per-setting exclusion option becomes available. Any configurations for that setting instance of *ASR Only Per Rule Exclusions* apply to only that setting.

You can continue to configure global exclusions that apply to all attack surface reduction rules on the device
by using the setting **Attack Surface Reduction Only Exclusions**.

Applies to:

- Windows 10/11

> [!NOTE]  
> ASR polices don't support merge functionality for *ASR Only Per Rule Exclusions* and a policy conflict can result when multiple polices that configure *ASR Only Per Rule Exclusions* for the same device conflict. To avoid conflicts, combine the configurations for *ASR Only Per Rule Exclusions* into a single ASR policy. We are investigating adding policy merge for *ASR Only Per Rule Exclusions* in a future update.

#### Grant apps permission to silently use certificates on Android Enterprise devices<!-- 12441244    -->  
You can now configure silent use of certificates by apps on Android Enterprise devices that enrolled as **Fully Managed, Dedicated, and Corporate-Owned work Profile**.

This capability is available on a new **Apps** page in the certificate profile configuration workflow by setting **Certificate access** to  **Grant silently for specific apps (require user approval for other apps)**.  With this configuration, the apps you then select silently use the certificate. All other apps continue to use the default behavior, which is to require user approval.

This capability supports the following certificate profiles for only Android Enterprise Fully Managed, Dedicated, and Corporate-Owned work Profiles:

- [Derived credentials](../protect/derived-credentials.md#use-derived-credentials-for-app-authentication)
- [Imported PKCS](../protect/certificates-imported-pfx-configure.md#create-a-pkcs-imported-certificate-profile)
- [PKCS](../protect/certificates-pfx-configure.md#create-a-pkcs-certificate-profile)
- [SCEP](../protect/certificates-profile-scep.md#create-a-scep-certificate-profile)

#### In-app notifications for Microsoft Intune app<!-- 13110609  -->  
Android Open Source Project(AOSP) device users can now receive compliance notifications in the Microsoft Intune app. This capability is only available on AOSP user-based devices. For more information, see [AOSP compliance notifications](../user-help/check-compliance-aosp.md#compliance-notifications).

### Intune apps

- **iOS/iPadOS web clip** 
- **Windows web link**

These new app types work in a similar way to the existing **web link** application type, however they apply only for their specific platform, whereas web link applications apply across all platforms. With these new app types, you can assign to groups and also use assignment filters to limit the scope of assignment. This functionality is in the [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431) > **Apps** > **All Apps** > **Add**.

### Device management

#### Microsoft Intune is ending support for Windows 8.1<!-- 14740233 -->
Microsoft Intune is ending support on October 21, 2022 for devices running Windows 8.1. After that date, technical assistance and automatic updates that help protect your devices running Windows 8.1 will no longer be available. Also, because the sideloading scenario for line-of-business apps is only applicable to Windows 8.1 devices, Intune no longer supports Windows 8.1 sideloading. Sideloading is installing, and then running or testing an app that isn't cerified by the Microsoft Store.

Intune-managed Android Enterprise dedicated devices enrolled with Microsoft Entra ID shared mode and Android (AOSP) devices can now receive app protection policies and can be targeted separately from other Android device types. For more information, see [Add Managed Google Play apps to Android Enterprise devices with Intune](../apps/apps-add-android-for-work.md). For more information about Android Enterprise dedicated devices and Android (AOSP), see [Android Enterprise dedicated devices](../fundamentals/deployment-guide-enrollment-android.md#android-enterprise-dedicated-devices).

### Device security

#### Users assigned the Endpoint Security Manager admin role can modify Mobile Threat Defense connector settings<!-- 14179885 -->
We've updated the permissions of the built-in [Endpoint Security Manager](../fundamentals/role-based-access-control.md#built-in-roles) admin role. The role now has the **Modify** permission for the **Mobile Threat Defense** category set to **Yes**. With this change, users assigned this role have permission to change the [Mobile Threat Defense connector](../protect/mtd-connector-enable.md) (MTD connector) settings for your Tenant. Previously, this permission was set to *No*.

If you missed the previous notice about this coming change, now is a good time to review the users that are assigned the *Endpoint Security Manager* role for your tenant. If any shouldn't have permissions to edit the MTD connector settings, update their role permissions or [create a custom role](../fundamentals/create-custom-role.md) that includes only *Read* permissions for Mobile Threat Defense.

View the full list of permissions for the built-in [Endpoint Security Manager role](../protect/endpoint-security.md#permissions-granted-by-the-endpoint-security-manager-role).

#### Improved certificate profile support for Android Enterprise Fully Managed devices<!-- 14217083  -->
We've improved our [PKCS](../protect/certificates-pfx-configure.md) and [SCEP](../protect/certificates-profile-scep.md) certificate profile support for Android Enterprise Fully Managed (Device Owner) devices. You can now use the Intune device ID variable, **CN={{DeviceID}}**, as the subject alternative name (SAN) in your certificates for these devices. 

### Device configuration

### Certificate profiles support for Android (AOSP) devices<!-- 8506319, 8506363 -->
You can now use the following [certificate profiles](../protect/certificates-configure.md) with corporate-owned and userless devices that run the Android Open Source Project (AOSP) platform: 
- Trusted certificate profile
- PKCS certificate profile

#### New settings for DFCI profiles on Windows 10/11 devices<!-- 6039135 -->
On Windows 10/11 devices, you can create a Device Firmware Configuration Interface (DFCI) profile (**Devices** > **Configuration** > **Create** > **Windows 10 and later** for platform > **Templates** > **Device Firmware Configuration Interface** for profile type).

DFCI profiles let Intune pass management commands to UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface) using the DFCI firmware layer. This firmware layer makes configuration more resilient to malicious attacks. DFCI also limits end users' control over the BIOS by graying out managed settings.

There are new settings you can configure:
- **Microphones and Speakers**:
  - Microphones

- **Radios**:
  - Bluetooth
  - Wi-Fi

- **Ports**:
  - USB type A

- **Wake settings**:
  - Wake on LAN
  - Wake on power

For more information, see the following resources:
- [Use Device Firmware Configuration Interface profiles on Windows devices in Microsoft Intune](../configuration/device-firmware-configuration-interface-windows.md)

#### Add custom support information to Android Enterprise devices<!-- 7913128 -->
On Android Enterprise devices, you can create a device restrictions configuration profile that manages device settings (**Devices** > **Configuration** > **Create** > **Android Enterprise** > **Fully managed, dedicated, and corporate-owned work profile** for platform > **Device restrictions** for profile type > **Custom support information**).

There are some new settings you can configure:
- **Short support message**: When users try to change a managed setting, you can add a short message that's shown to users in a system dialog window.
- **Long support message**: You can add a long message that's shown in **Settings** > **Security** > **Device admin apps** > **Device Policy**.

By default, the OEM default messages are shown. When you deploy a custom message, the Intune default message is also deployed. If you don't enter a custom message for the device's default language, then the Intune default message is shown. 

For example, you deploy a custom message for English and French. The user changes the device's default language to Spanish. Since you didn't deploy a custom message to the Spanish language, the Intune default message is shown.

The Intune default message is translated for all languages in the Endpoint Manger admin center (**Settings** > **Language + Region**). The **Language** setting value determines the default language used by Intune. By default, it's set to **English**.

In the policy, you can customize the messages for the following languages:
- Czech
- German
- English (United States)
- Spanish (Spain)
- French (France)
- Hungarian
- Indonesian
- Italian
- Japanese
- Korean
- Dutch
- Polish
- Portuguese (Brazil)

### Device security

#### Microsoft Tunnel support for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.6<!-- 14642908  -->

You can now use Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 8.6 with [Microsoft Tunnel](../protect/microsoft-tunnel-overview.md). There are no other requirements beyond the requirements needed for RHEL 8.5 support.
 
Like RHEL 8.5, you can use the [readiness tool](../protect/microsoft-tunnel-prerequisites.md#run-the-readiness-tool) (mst-readiness) to check for the presence of the ip_tables module in the Linux kernel. By default, RHEL 8.6 doesn't load the ip_tables module.

For Linux servers that don't load the module, we've provided [instructions](../protect/microsoft-tunnel-prerequisites.md#manually-load-ip_tables) to load them immediately, and to configure the Linux server to automatically load them at boot.

## Week of June 6, 2022  

### App management  

#### Photo library data transfer support via app protection policies<!-- 9450163, 14062176 -->
You can now select to include **Photo Library** as a supported application storage service. By selecting **Photo Library** from the **Allow users to open data from selected services** or the **Allow users to save data to selected services** setting within Intune, you can allow managed accounts to allow *incoming* and *outgoing* data to and from their device's photo library to their managed apps on iOS and Android platforms. In [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431), select **Apps** > **App protection policies** > **Create Policy**. Choose either **iOS/iPadOS** or **Android**. This setting is available as part of the **Data protection** step and specifically for **Policy managed apps**. For more information, see [Data protection](../apps/app-protection-framework.md).

#### UI improvements show Android enrollment is available, not required<!-- 8764312 -->

We updated the iconography in the Company Portal for Android app to make it easier for users to recognize when device enrollment is available to them but not required. The new iconography appears in scenarios where the device enrollment availability is set to **Available, no prompts** in the admin center (**Tenant admin** > **Customization** > **Create** or **Edit** a policy > **Settings**).      

Changes include:  

 - On the Devices screen, users will no longer see a red exclamation point next to a non-enrolled device.  
 - On the Device Details screen, users will no longer see a red exclamation point next to the enrollment message. Instead, they'll see the info **(i)** icon.    

To view screenshots of the changes, see [UI updates for Intune end-user apps](../fundamentals/whats-new-app-ui.md).

In public preview, two Windows Update compatibility reports are now available to help you prepare for a Windows upgrade or update. These reports fill a gap that is currently covered by Desktop Analytics, which is [scheduled to be retired](https://aka.ms/DANextSteps) on November 30, 2022.

Use these reports to help you plan for an upgrade from Windows 10 to 11 or for installing the latest Windows feature update:

- **Windows feature update device readiness report (Preview)** - This report provides per-device information about compatibility risks that are associated with an upgrade or update to a chosen version of Windows.
- **Windows feature update compatibility risks report (Preview)** - This report provides a summary view of the top compatibility risks across your organization for a chosen version of Windows. You can use this report to understand which compatibility risks affect the greatest number of devices in your organization.

These reports are rolling out to tenants over the next week. If you don't see them yet, check back again in a day or so. To learn about prerequisites, licensing, and what information is available with these reports, see [Windows Update compatibility reports](../protect/windows-update-compatibility-reports.md).

## Week of May 30, 2022 (Service release 2205)

### App management

#### iOS Company Portal minimum required version<!-- 13016075 -->
Starting June 1, 2022, the minimum supported version of the iOS Company Portal app will be v5.2205. If your users are running v5.2204 or earlier, they're prompted for an update at login. If you have enabled the **[Block installing apps using App Store](../configuration/device-restrictions-ios.md#settings-apply-to-automated-device-enrollment-supervised)** device restriction setting, you will likely need to push an update to the related devices that use this setting. Otherwise, no action is needed. If you have a helpdesk, make them aware of the prompt to update the Company Portal app. In most cases, users have app updates set to automatic, so they receive the updated Company Portal app without taking any action. For more information, see [Intune Company Portal](../apps/company-portal-app.md).

#### Push notifications are automatically sent when device ownership changes from Personal to Corporate<!-- 12390037 -->
For iOS/iPad and Android devices, a push notification is now automatically sent when a device's [ownership type is changed from Personal to Corporate](../enrollment/corporate-identifiers-add.md#change-device-ownership). The notification is pushed through the Company Portal app on the device.

With this change, we've removed the Company Portal configuration setting that was previously used to manage this notification behavior.

#### iOS/iPadOS notifications require March Company Portal or newer<!-- 14131757 -->
With Intune's May (2205) service release, we have made service side updates to iOS/iPadOS notifications that require users to have the March Company Portal app (version 5.2203.0) or newer. If you're using functionality that could generate iOS/iPadOS Company Portal push notifications, you must ensure your users update the iOS/iPadOS Company Portal to continue receiving push notifications. There's no other change in functionality. For more information, see [Update the Company Portal app](../user-help/install-a-new-version-of-the-company-portal-app.md).

#### Deployment of macOS LOB apps by uploading PKG-type installer files is now generally available<!-- 10671861 -->  
You can now deploy macOS line-of-business (LOB) apps by uploading PKG-type installer files to Intune. This capability is out of public preview and is now generally available. 

To add a macOS LOB app from [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431), select **Apps** > **macOS** > **Add** > **Line-of-business app**. Also, the App Wrapping Tool for macOS will no longer be required to deploy macOS LOB apps. For more information, see [How to add macOS line-of-business (LOB) apps to Microsoft Intune](../apps/lob-apps-macos.md).

#### Improved report experience on the Managed Apps pane<!-- 10147133 -->
The **Managed Apps** pane has been updated to better display managed app details for a device. You can switch between displaying managed app details for the primary user and other users on a device, or display app details for the device without any user. The generated app details are displayed using the primary user of the device when the report is initially loaded, or displayed with no primary user if none exists. For more information, see [Managed Apps report](../fundamentals/reports.md#managed-apps-report-operational).

#### MSfB licenses and Apple VPP licenses<!-- 10742713a -->
Removing an Intune license from a user will no longer revoke app licenses granted through the Microsoft Store for Business or through Apple VPP. For more information, see [How to manage volume purchased apps from the Microsoft Store for Business with Microsoft Intune](../apps/windows-store-for-business.md), [Revoking iOS app licenses](../apps/vpp-apps-ios.md#revoking-app-licenses), and [Microsoft Intune licensing](../fundamentals/licenses.md).

#### Reporting for unlicensed users<!-- 10742713b -->
Intune will no longer remove users from all Intune reports when they're unlicensed. Until the user is deleted from Microsoft Entra ID, Intune will continue to report the user in most common scenarios. For related information about reporting, see [Intune reports](../fundamentals/reports.md).

### Device security

#### New Device Control profile for Intune's endpoint security Attack Surface Reduction policy<!-- 8844611 -->

As part of the continuing [rollout of new profiles for endpoint security policies](whats-new-archive.md#new-profile-templates-and-settings-structure-for-endpoint-security-policies), which began in April 2022, we've released a new Device Control profile template for [Attack Surface Reduction](../protect/endpoint-security-asr-policy.md) policy for endpoint security in Intune. This profile replaces the previous profile of the same name for the *Windows 10 and later* platform.

With this replacement, only instances of the new profile can be created. However, any profiles you've previously created that use the old profile structure remain available to use, edit, and deploy.

The new Device Control profile:
- Includes all the settings that were available in the original profile.
- Introduces five new settings that are not available in the older profile.

The five new settings focus on removable devices, like USB devices:
- [Prevent installation of removable devices](/windows/client-management/mdm/policy-csp-admx-deviceinstallation?WT.mc_id=Portal-fx#admx-deviceinstallation-deviceinstall-removable-deny)
- [WPD Devices: Deny read access](/windows/client-management/mdm/policy-csp-admx-removablestorage?WT.mc_id=Portal-fx#admx-removablestorage-wpddevices-denyread-access-2)

### Device management

#### Software updates page for tenant attached devices<!-- 13089257, 13035723 -->
There's a new **Software updates** page for tenant attached devices. This page displays the status for software updates on a device. You can review which updates are successfully installed, failed, and are assigned but not yet installed. Using the timestamp for the update status assists with troubleshooting. For more information, see [Tenant attach: Software updates in the admin center](../../configmgr/tenant-attach/software-updates.md).

#### Microsoft Defender for Endpoint support for App Sync on iOS/iPadOS<!-- 9768396 -->
*Before you can use this capability, you must opt in to a Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Preview. To opt in, contact `mdatpmobile@microsoft.com`.* 

When you use Microsoft Defender for Endpoint as your Mobile Threat Defense application, you can [configure Defender for Endpoint to request Application Inventory data](../protect/advanced-threat-protection-configure.md#connect-microsoft-defender-for-endpoint-to-intune) from Intune from iOS/iPadOS devices. The following two settings are now available:

- **Enable App Sync for iOS Devices**:  Set to **On** to allow Microsoft Defender for Endpoint to request metadata of iOS applications from Intune to use for threat analysis purposes. The iOS device must be MDM-enrolled and will provide updated app data during device check-in.

- **Send full application inventory data on personally owned iOS/iPadOS Devices**: This setting controls the application inventory data. Intune shares this data with Microsoft Defender for Endpoint when Defender for Endpoint syncs app data and requests the app inventory list.

  When set to **On**, Defender for Endpoint can request a list of applications from Intune for personally owned iOS/iPadOS devices. This list includes unmanaged apps and apps that were deployed through Intune.

  When set to **Off**, data about unmanaged apps isn't provided. Intune does share data for the apps that were deployed through Intune.

#### Support for Retire on Android Enterprise corporate-owned work-profiles devices<!-- 10216870 -->
You can now use the **Retire** admin action in the **Microsoft Intune admin center**  to remove the work profile including all corporate apps, data, and policies from an Android Enterprise corporate-owned work profile device. Go to **Intune admin center** > **Devices** pane > **All Devices** > then select the name of the device you want to retire and select **Retire**.  

When you select **Retire**, the device is unenrolled from Intune management. However, all the data and apps associated with your personal profile remain untouched on the device.
For more information, see [Retire or wipe devices using Microsoft Intune](../remote-actions/devices-wipe.md).

### Device enrollment

#### Improvements for enrollment profiles for Apple Automated Device Enrollment<!-- 13165752 -->
Two Setup Assistant skip panes, previously released in Intune for public preview, are now generally available to use in Intune. These screens typically appear in Setup Assistant during Apple Automated Device Enrollment (ADE).  You can configure screen visibility while you're setting up an enrollment profile in Intune.  Intune-supported screen settings are available in the device enrollment profile under the **Setup Assistant** tab.  The new skip panes are: 
 
- Pane name: **Get Started** 
  - Available for iOS/iPadOS 13 and later.
  - This pane is visible in Setup Assistant during ADE by default.  
  
- Pane name: **Auto Unlock with Apple Watch**
  - Available for macOS 12 and later. 
  - This pane is visible in Setup Assistant during ADE by default.  

There's no change to functionality from the public preview release.

#### Enroll to co-management from Windows Autopilot<!-- 11300628 -->
You can configure device enrollment in Intune to enable co-management, which happens during the [Windows Autopilot](/autopilot/windows-autopilot) process. This behavior directs the workload authority in an orchestrated manner between Configuration Manager and Intune.

If the device is targeted with an [Autopilot enrollment status page (ESP) policy](../enrollment/windows-enrollment-status.md), the device will wait for Configuration Manager. The Configuration Manager client installs, registers with the site, and applies the production co-management policy. Then the Autopilot ESP continues.

For more information, see [How to enroll to co-management with Autopilot](../../configmgr/comanage/autopilot-enrollment.md).

#### Elevation enhancements to Remote Help<!-- 12453415 -->

Elevation permissions will no longer be assigned when a session is started. Elevation permissions will now apply only when JIT (just in time) access is requested.  The access is requested when you select a button on the toolbar. 
When elevation permissions are assigned, the sign out behavior for the sharer has been modified as follows:
 - If the admin (helper) ends the Remote Help session, the user (sharer) will not be logged off.
 - If the sharer tries to end the session, they're prompted that they will be logged off if they continue.
 - If the sharer is a local admin on their device, the access UAC prompt option will not be available to the helper as they can guide the sharer to perform elevated actions under their own profile.
For more information about Remote Help, see [Use Remote Help](/mem/intune/fundamentals/remote-help)

For more information, see [Locate lost or stolen devices](../remote-actions/device-locate.md).

### Device enrollment

#### New enrollment profile settings for Apple Automated Device Enrollment (public preview)<!-- 10111795 -->
We've added two new Setup Assistant settings that you can use with Apple Automated Device Enrollment. Each setting controls the visibility of a Setup Assistant pane shown during enrollment. Setup Assistant panes are shown during enrollment by default, so you have to adjust the settings in Microsoft Intune if you want to hide them.

The new Setup Assistant settings are:

- **Get Started** (preview):  Show or hide the Get Started pane during enrollment. For devices running iOS/iPadOS 13 and later. 
- **Auto Unlock with Apple Watch** (preview):  Show or hide the Unlock Your Mac with your Apple Watch pane during enrollment. For devices running macOS 12 and later.

 To configure Setup Assistant settings for Automated Device Enrollment, [create an iOS/iPadOS enrollment profile](../enrollment/device-enrollment-program-enroll-ios.md#create-an-apple-enrollment-profile) or [macOS enrollment profile](../enrollment/device-enrollment-program-enroll-macos.md#create-an-apple-enrollment-profile) in Microsoft Intune.  

### Device security

### Microsoft Defender for Endpoint as the Tunnel client app for iOS is now Generally Available<!-- 9849514  --> 

Use of Microsoft Defender for Endpoint that supports [Microsoft Tunnel](../protect/microsoft-tunnel-overview.md) on iOS/iPadOS is now out of preview and is generally available. With general availability, a new version of the Defender for Endpoint app for iOS is available from the App store to download and deploy. If you've been using the preview version as your Tunnel client app for iOS, we recommend you upgrade to the latest Defender for Endpoint app for iOS soon to gain the benefits of the latest updates and fixes.

As of August 30, 2022, the connection type is named **Microsoft Tunnel**.

With this release, by the end of June, both the standalone Tunnel client app and the preview version of Defender for Endpoint as the Tunnel client app for iOS will be deprecated and be dropped from support. Soon after that deprecation, the standalone Tunnel client app will no longer function and will no longer support opening connections to Microsoft Tunnel.

If you're still using the standalone tunnel app for iOS, plan to [migrate to the Microsoft Defender for Endpoint app](../protect/microsoft-tunnel-configure.md). Migrate before support for the standalone app ends and its support to connect to Tunnel stops working.


#### Attack surface reduction rules profile<!-- 8858871 -->
The **Attack Surface Reduction Rules (ConfigMgr)** profile for tenant attached devices is now in public preview. For more information, see [Tenant attach: Create and deploy attack surface reduction policies](../../configmgr/tenant-attach/deploy-asr-policy.md#bkmk_asr).

### Device configuration

#### Endpoint security profiles support filters<!-- 11889620 -->
There are some new features when using filters:
- When you create a device configuration profile for Windows devices, a per-policy report shows reporting information in the **Device and user check-in status** (**Devices** > **Configuration** > Select an existing policy).

  When you select **View report**, the report has an **Assignment Filter** column. Use this column to determine if a filter successfully applied to your policy.

- Endpoint Security policies support filters. So, when you assign an endpoint security policy, you can use filters to assign the policy based on rules you create.

- When you create a new endpoint security policy, it automatically uses the [new device configuration profile reporting](whats-new-archive.md#new-reporting-experience-for-device-configuration-profiles). When you look at the per-policy report, it also has an **Assignment Filter** column (**Devices** > **Configuration** > Select an existing endpoint security policy > **View report**). Use this column to determine if a filter successfully applied to your policy.

## April 2022

### App management

#### Uninstall DMG-type applications on managed macOS devices (Public preview)<!-- 13155022 -->
You can use the **Uninstall** assignment type to remove DMG-type applications on managed macOS devices from Microsoft Intune. You can find macOS DMG apps in [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431) by selecting **Apps** > **macOS** > **macOS app (.DMG)**. For more information, see [Add a macOS DMG app to Microsoft Intune](../apps/lob-apps-macos-dmg.md). 

### Device Management

#### Updating the device diagnostics folder structure<!-- 8637490 -->

Intune now exports [Windows Device Diagnostic data](../remote-actions/collect-diagnostics.md) in an updated format. With the updated format, the logs collected are named to match the data collected, and when multiple files are collected a folder is created. With the earlier format, the zip file used a flat structure of numbered folders that didn't identify their contents.

To take advantage of this diagnostic logging update, devices must install one of the following updates:
- **Windows 11** - KB5011563
- **Windows 10** - KB5011543

These updates are available through the Windows Updates on April 12, 2022.

#### Microsoft Intune premium add-ons<!-- 12953253  -->

Microsoft Intune is introducing a new centralized experience to help IT admins identify premium add-on capabilities. These capabilities can be added for another licensing cost available for Microsoft Intune. The first premium add-on is Remote Help.

You can find premium add-ons in Intune under **Tenant administration** > **Premium add-ons**. The **Summary** blade shows all premium add-ons that have been released, a short description, and the status of the add-on. You can view the status of each add-on as either **Active** or **Available for trial or purchase**. The premium add-ons capability can be used by Global and Billing administrators to start trials or purchase licenses for premium add-ons.

For more information about Premium add-ons, see [Use Premium add-ons capabilities with Intune](../fundamentals/intune-add-ons.md).

### Device security

#### New profile templates and settings structure for endpoint security policies<!-- 13742640 -->

We've begun to release new [endpoint security profile templates](../protect/endpoint-security-policy.md) that use the settings format as found in the Settings Catalog. Each new profile template includes the same settings as the older profile it replaces, while bringing the following improvements:

- **Setting names match the Windows CSP name**: In most cases, each setting name in the new profiles is a match to the name of the CSP that the setting configures. However, in the Intune UI we've added spaces to that name to make the setting name easier to read. For example, a setting in the Intune UI that's named *Allow USB Connection* configures the CSP named [AllowUSBConnection](/windows/client-management/mdm/policy-csp-connectivity#connectivity-allowusbconnection).

- **Setting options align to those of the Windows CSP**: Options for settings now align directly to those options as described and supported by the Windows CSP, with one addition. The addition is that we've included the option of Not configured. When a setting is set to Not configured, that Intune profile doesn't actively manage that setting. When a profile is changed to go from active configuration of  setting Not configured, Intune stops actively enforcing the configuration for that setting on the device.

- **Setting guidance is taken from the Windows CSP**: The information about the setting found in the Intune UI is taken directly from the Windows CSP content, with Learn more links opening the documentation for the relevant CSP, or the content page that includes that CSP. The CSP defines and manages the settings behavior.

When a new platform and profile template is available for a policy type, the older profile of the same name will no longer be available to create new profiles. Instead, new profiles must use the new profiles and settings format. Eventually, your old profiles will be supported for conversion to the new profile format.  Until that conversion is available, you can still use, edit, and deploy your existing profiles.  

The following profile templates are now available in the new settings format:

| Policy type  | Platform  | Profile (template) name  |
|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Antivirus | Windows 10, Windows 11, and Windows Server | Windows Security experience |
| Antivirus | Windows 10, Windows 11, and Windows Server | Windows Defender Antivirus    |
| Antivirus | Windows 10, Windows 11, and Windows Server | Windows Defender Antivirus Exclusions
| Firewall | Windows 10, Windows 11, and Windows Server | Microsoft Defender Firewall |
| Firewall | Windows 10, Windows 11, and Windows Server | Microsoft Defender Firewall Rules |
| Endpoint detection and response | Windows 10, Windows 11, and Windows Server | Endpoint detection and response |
| Attack surface reduction | Windows 10 and Later | Attack surface reduction rules |
| Attack surface reduction | Windows 10 and Later | Exploit protection |

`%windir%\temp\%computername%*.log`</br>
`%windir%\temp\officeclicktorun*.log`  

### Device configuration

#### New reporting experience for device configuration profiles<!-- 8466004 -->
There's now a new reporting experience for device configuration profiles. This reporting experience excludes Windows administrative template (ADMX), Android Enterprise devices with OEMConfig, and Device Firmware Configuration Interface (DFCI) profile types. 

We are continuing to update Intune's report experience to enhance consistency, accuracy, organization, and data representation, which gives an overall "facelift" of Intune's per policy reporting. The new experience updates the per policy overview page to shift away from donut charts to a sleeker overview chart that quickly updates as devices/users check-in. 

There are three reports available from the per policy view:
- **Device and user check-in status** - This report combines information that was previously split into separate device status and user status reports. This report shows the list of device and user check-ins for the device configuration profile, with the check-in status and last check-in time. When you open the report, the aggregate chart will remain at the top of the page, and the data will be consistent with the list data. Use the filter column to view assignment filter options.
- **Device assignment status** - This report surfaces data on the latest status for assigned devices from the device configuration profile. Intune reporting will include pending state information.
- **Per setting status** - This report surfaces the summary of device and user check-ins that are in **Success**, **Conflict**, **Error** states at the granular setting level within the device configuration profile. This report uses the same consistency and performance updates and navigation tools we've made available to other reports.

More drilldowns are available and more assignment filters are supported for each report. For more information about each of these reports, see [Intune reports](../fundamentals/reports.md).

#### Google Chrome settings are in Settings Catalog and Administrative Templates<!-- 6198569 -->

#### Manage the app inventory data for iOS/iPadOS devices that Intune sends to third-party MTD partners<!-- 10722315 -->
You can now configure the type of application inventory data for personally owned iOS/iPadOS devices that Intune sends to your chosen third-party Mobile Threat Defense (MTD) partner.
 
To control the app inventory data, configure the following setting as part of the *MDM Compliance Policy Settings* on the [Mobile Threat Defense connector](../protect/mtd-connector-enable.md#to-enable-the-mobile-threat-defense-connector) for your partner:
 
- **Send full application inventory data on personally owned iOS/iPadOS Devices**
 
  Options for this setting include:
  - **On** - If your MTD partner syncs app data and requests a list of the iOS/iPadOS applications from Intune, then that list includes unmanaged apps (apps not deployed through Intune) and apps deployed through Intune. This behavior is the current behavior.
  - **Off** - Data about unmanaged apps won't be provided, and the MTD partner only receives details about apps that were deployed through Intune.
 
For corporate devices, data about managed and unmanaged apps continues to be included with requests for app data by your MTD vendor.

### Monitor and troubleshoot

#### Safeguard holds are now visible in the Feature update failures report<!-- 10948779 -->
When a device is blocked from installing a Windows update due to a [safeguard hold](/windows/deployment/update/safeguard-holds), you can view details about that hold in the Microsoft Intune admin center > [Feature update failures report](../protect/windows-update-reports.md#use-the-feature-update-failures-operational-report).

A device with a safeguard hold appears as a device with an error in the report. When you view details for such a device, the *Alert Message* column displays **Safeguard Hold**, and the *Deployment Error Code* column displays the ID of the safeguard hold.

Microsoft occasionally places safeguard holds to block installation of an update on a device when something detected on that device is known to result in a poor post-update experience. For example, software or drivers are common reasons to place a safeguard hold. The hold remains in place until the underlying issue is resolved, and the update is safe to install.

To learn more about active safeguard holds and expectations for their resolution, go to the Windows release health dashboard at [https://aka.ms/WindowsReleaseHealth](/windows/release-health/).  

#### Improvements for managing Windows Updates for pre-release builds<!-- 9231846 -->
We've improved the experience of using [Update rings for Windows 10 and later](../protect/windows-10-update-rings.md) to manage  Windows updates for pre-release builds. The improvements include: 

- **Enable pre-release builds** is a new control in on the *Update ring settings* page for update rings. Use this setting to configure assigned devices to update to a pre-release build. You can select the following list of pre-release builds:
  - **Beta Channel**
  - **Dev Channel**
  - **Windows Insider - Release Preview**

  For more information about pre-release builds, see the [Windows Insider](https://insider.windows.com/understand-flighting) website.
- Devices assigned *Update rings for Windows 10 and later* policies will no longer have the *ManagePreviewBuilds* setting changed during Autopilot. When this setting changed during Autopilot, it forced another device reboot.

#### Use Update Rings for Windows 10 and later to upgrade to Windows 11<!-- 10753015 -->
There's a [new setting](../protect/windows-update-settings.md#update-settings) to *Update Rings for Windows 10 and later*. This setting can upgrade eligible devices from Windows 10 to Windows 11:

- **Upgrade Windows 10 devices to Latest Windows 11 release**: By default, this setting is set to No. When set to *Yes*, eligible Windows 10 devices that receive this policy update to the latest build of Windows 11.

  When set to *Yes*, Intune displays an information box that confirms that by deploying this setting, you're accepting the Microsoft License Terms for devices that upgrade. The information box also contains a link to the [Microsoft License Terms](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2171206).

For more information about update rings, see [Update Rings for Windows 10 and later](../protect/windows-10-update-rings.md).

#### Disable Activation Lock remote device action for iOS/iPadOS has been removed from UI<!-- 10606548 -->
The remote device action to *Disable Activation Lock* is no longer available in Intune. You can bypass Activation Lock as detailed at [Disable Activation Lock on Supervised iOS/iPadOS devices with Intune](../remote-actions/device-activation-lock-disable.md).

This remote action is removed because the action to disable the [iOS/iPadOS Activation Lock](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201365) feature did not function as intended.

#### Updates for security baselines<!-- 9549108,  10873848 -->
We have a pair of updates for [security baselines](../protect/security-baselines.md), which add the following settings:
- **Security baseline for Windows 10 and later** (Applies to Windows 10 and Windows 11) 
  The new baseline version is [November 2021](../protect/security-baseline-settings-mdm-all.md) and adds **Scan scripts that are used in Microsoft browsers** to the *Microsoft Defender* category. This baseline has no other changes.

- **Windows 365 Security Baseline (Preview)**
  The new baseline version is [Version 2110](../protect/security-baseline-settings-windows-365.md) and adds the following two settings, with no other changes:
  - **Scan scripts that are used in Microsoft browsers** is added to the *Microsoft Defender* category.
  - **Enable tamper protection to prevent Microsoft Defender being disabled** is added to *Windows Security*, which is a new category added with this baseline version.

#### Use custom settings for Device Compliance for Windows 10/11 devices (public preview)<!-- 7536730 -->
As a public preview, device compliance policy for Windows 10 and Windows 11 devices supports the addition of custom settings to a device compliance policy. Results from custom settings appear in the Microsoft Intune admin center along with other compliance policy details.

To use custom settings, you create and add the following to the admin center to power custom compliance settings:
- **JSON file** – The JSON file details the custom settings and their compliance values. The JSON also includes information you provide to your users on how to remediate the settings when noncompliant.
- **PowerShell script** – The PowerShell script will deploy to devices where it runs to determine the state of the settings defined in your JSON file, and reports them back to Intune.

With the JSON and script ready, you can then create a standard compliance policy that includes your custom settings. The option to include custom settings is found in a new compliance settings category named *Custom Compliance*.

To learn more, including examples for the .JSON and PowerShell script, see [Custom compliance settings](../protect/compliance-use-custom-settings.md).

#### New scheduling options for Feature updates for Windows 10 and later<!-- 6286037 -->
We've added a trio of *Rollout options* to support improved scheduling of when the updates from a policy for *Feature updates for Windows 10 and later* are made available for your devices to install. These new options include:
- **Make update available as soon as possible** - There is no delay in making the update available, which has been the previous behavior.
- **Make update available on a specific date** - With this option you then select the first day that this update will be offered by Windows Update to the devices that receive this policy.
- **Make update available gradually** - With this option, Windows Update divides the devices that receive this policy into different groups that are calculated based on a start group time, end group time, and days to wait between groups. Windows update then offers the update to those groups one at a time, until the last group is offered the update. This process helps distribute the availability of the update across the time you've configured. It can reduce the impact to your network when compared to offering the update to all devices at the same time.

For more information including details for gradual availability, see [Rollout options for Windows Updates](../protect/windows-update-rollout-options.md).

#### New details for Windows devices available in the Microsoft Intune admin center<!-- 6208666 -->
The following details for Windows 10 and Windows 11 devices are now collected and can be viewed on a devices details pane of the Microsoft Intune admin center: 
- System Management BIOS version
- TPM Manufacturer version
- TPM Manufacturer ID

These details are also included when you *export* the details from the *All devices* pane.  

#### Settings for Shared iPad now generally available<!-- 10975827  -->  
Four Shared iPad settings are now out of preview and generally available to use when creating an Apple enrollment profile. These settings are applied during automated device enrollment (ADE).

For iPadOS 14.5 and later in Shared iPad mode:  
  - **Require Shared iPad temporary setting only**: Configures the device so that users only see the guest version of the sign-in experience, and must sign in as guest users. They can't sign in with a Managed Apple ID.
  - **Maximum seconds of inactivity until temporary session logs out**: If there isn't any activity after the specified time, the temporary session automatically signs out.
  - **Maximum seconds of inactivity until user session logs out**: If there isn't any activity after the specified time, the user session automatically signs out.  

For iPadOS 13.0 and later in Shared iPad mode:  
  - **Maximum seconds after screen lock before password is required for Shared iPad**: If the screen lock exceeds this amount of time, a device password will be required to unlock the device.

For more information about setting up devices in Shared iPad mode, see [Create an Apple enrollment profile](../enrollment/device-enrollment-program-enroll-ios.md#create-an-apple-enrollment-profile).

#### Duplicate a settings catalog profile<!-- 9666635 -->      
Settings catalog profiles now support duplication. To create a copy of an existing profile, select **Duplicate**.  The copy contains the same setting configurations and scope tags as the original profile, but doesn't have any assignments attached to it. For more information about the settings catalog, see [Use the settings catalog to configure settings on Windows and macOS devices](../configuration/settings-catalog.md).

#### Work from anywhere report<!-- 7207657 -->
The **Work from anywhere** report has replaced the **Recommended software** report in [Endpoint analytics](../../analytics/overview.md). The **Work from anywhere** report contains metrics for Windows, cloud management, cloud identity, and cloud provisioning. For more information, see the [Work from anywhere report](../../analytics/work-from-anywhere.md) article.

#### Locations deprecated for Android device administrator<!-- 9492223 -->

In October 2021, support for using locations in device compliance policy for devices enrolled as Android device administrator was deprecated. Use of locations is often referred to as network fencing.

For Android device administrator, the policies and dependences that relied on network fence capabilities no longer function. As previously announced, we are re-envisioning support for network fencing. More information will be shared when it's available.

### Device security

#### View BitLocker recovery keys for tenant attached devices<!-- 8509415 -->
You can now [view the BitLocker recovery key for tenant-attached devices](../protect/encrypt-devices.md#view-details-for-recovery-keys) in the Microsoft Intune admin center. The recovery keys continue to be stored on-premises for tenant-attached devices, but the visibility in the admin center is intended to assist your Helpdesk scenarios from within the admin center. 

To view the keys, your Intune account must have the Intune RBAC permissions to view BitLocker keys, and must be associated with an on-premises user that has the related on-premises permissions in Configuration Manager of Collection Role, with the permission **Read BitLocker Recovery Key Permission**.

Users with the correct permissions can view keys by going to **Devices** > **Windows devices** > *select a device* > **Recovery keys**.

Configuration Manager sites that run version 2107 or later support this feature. For sites that run version 2107, you need to install an update rollup to support Microsoft Entra joined devices. For more information, see [KB11121541](../../configmgr/hotfix/2107/11121541.md).

#### BitLocker settings added to settings catalog<!-- 10956191 -->  
We have added 9 [BitLocker settings that were previously only available in Group Policy (GP)](/windows/security/information-protection/bitlocker/bitlocker-group-policy-settings) to the Microsoft Intune settings catalog. To access the settings, go to **Devices** > **Configuration** and create a settings catalog profile for devices running Windows 10 and later. Then search **BitLocker** in the settings catalog to view all settings related to BitLocker. For more information about the settings catalog, see [Create a policy using settings catalog](../configuration/settings-catalog.md). The added settings include:  

- **Provide the unique identifiers for your organization** 
- **Enforce drive encryption type on fixed data drives** 
- **Allow devices compliant with InstantGo or HSTI to opt out of preboot PIN** 
- **Allow enhanced PINs for startup** 
- **Disallow standard users from changing the PIN or password** 
- **Enable use of BitLocker authentication requiring preboot keyboard input on slates** 
- **Enforce drive encryption type on operating system drives** 
- **Control use of BitLocker on removable drives**
- **Enforce drive encryption type on removable data drives** 

#### Security Management with Defender for Endpoint (public preview)<!-- 5475445   -->

*This feature is in public preview and will roll out to tenants gradually over the next few weeks. You can confirm your tenant has received this capability when the relevant toggles show in both the Microsoft Intune admin center and Microsoft Defender for Endpoint.*

*Security Management with Microsoft Defender for Endpoint* is a new configuration channel. Use this channel to manage the security configuration for Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (MDE) on devices that don't enroll into Microsoft Intune. With this scenario, it's Defender for Endpoint on a device that retrieves, enforces, and reports on the policies for Defender for Endpoint that you deploy from Microsoft Intune. The devices are joined to your Microsoft Entra ID and are also visible in the Microsoft Intune admin center alongside other devices you manage with Intune and Configuration Manager.

For more information, see [Manage Microsoft Defender for Endpoint on devices with Microsoft Intune](../protect/mde-security-integration.md).

### Monitor and troubleshoot

#### Remote Help app is available as a public preview<!-- 9843480 -->

As a public preview, you can use of the Remote Help app with your Intune tenant. With Remote Help, users who authenticate to your Azure Active directly can remotely assist others by connecting a Remote Help session between devices.

With permissions in Remote Help managed by Intune role-based access controls, you control:

- Who has permissions to help others
- The actions they can take while helping others

The capabilities of Remote Help include:

- **Enable Remote Help for your tenant** –If you choose to turn on Remote Help, its use is enabled tenant-wide.
- **Requires Organization login** - To use Remote Help, both the helper and the sharer must sign in with a Microsoft Entra account from your organization.
- **Use Remote Help with unenrolled devices** – You can choose to allow help to devices that aren't enrolled with Intune.
- **Compliance Warnings** - Before connecting to device, a helper sees a non-compliance warning about that device if it's not compliant to its assigned policies. This warning doesn't block access but provides transparency about the risk of using sensitive data like administrative credentials during the session.
- **Role-based access control** – Admins can set RBAC rules that determine the scope of a helper's access and what the actions they can take while providing assistance.
- **Elevation of privilege** - When needed, a helper with the correct RBAC permissions can interact with the UAC prompt on the sharer's machine to enter credentials.
- **Monitor active Remote Help sessions, and view details about past sessions** – In the Microsoft Intune admin center you can view reports that include details about who helped who, on what device, and for how long. You'll also find details about active sessions.

This feature is rolling out over the next week and should soon be available for your tenant. For more information, see [Use Remote Help](/mem/intune/fundamentals/remote-help).

#### MDM support data to refresh automatically in Group Policy analytics tool<!-- 7852080 -->
Now whenever Microsoft makes changes to the mappings in Intune, the **MDM Support** column in the GP analytics tool automatically updates to reflect the changes. The automation is an improvement over the previous behavior, which required you to reimport your Group Policy object (GPO) to refresh the data. For more information about Group Policy analytics, see [Use Group Policy analytics](../configuration/group-policy-analytics.md).  

## October 2021

### App management

#### Manage iOS/iPadOS Universal Links using App Protection Policies<!-- 2850827 -->

### Device enrollment

#### User Assignment<!-- 12376959 part 2 -->
Last week we made a change to the authentication experience during user enrollment for Autopilot. This change affects all Autopilot deployments where a user is assigned to a specific device prior to going through enrollment.

#### One-time self-deployment and pre-provisioning<!-- 12376959 part 3 -->
We made a change to the Windows Autopilot self-deployment mode and pre-provisioning mode experience, adding in a step to delete the device record as part of the device re-use process. This change affects all Windows Autopilot deployments where the Autopilot profile is set to self-deployment or pre-provisioning mode. This change will only affect a device when it's re-used or when it's reset and attempts to redeploy. For more information, see [Updates to the Windows Autopilot sign-in and deployment experience](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/intune-customer-success/updates-to-the-windows-autopilot-sign-in-and-deployment/ba-p/2848452).  

### Device management

#### Removal of Wi-Fi MAC address on specific Android Enterprise devices<!-- 11004658 -->
Intune will no longer display a Wi-Fi MAC address for newly enrolled personally owned work profile devices and devices managed with device administrator running Android 9 and later. Google is requiring all app updates to target [API 30 by November 2021](https://developer.android.com/distribute/play-policies#APILevel30). With this change, Android prevents apps from collecting the MAC address used by the device. For more information, see [Hardware device details](../remote-actions/device-inventory.md#hardware-device-details).

#### Use Feature Updates to upgrade devices to Windows 11<!-- 10053623  -->

### Device security

#### MFA changes to Windows Autopilot enrollment flow<!-- 12376959 part 1 -->
To improve the baseline security for Microsoft Entra ID, we changed Microsoft Entra behavior for multifactor authentication (MFA) during device registration. Previously, if a user completed MFA as part of their device registration, the MFA claim was carried over to the user state after registration was complete. Going forward, the MFA claim isn't preserved after registration and users will be prompted to redo MFA for any apps that require MFA by policy. For more information, see [Windows Autopilot MFA changes to enrollment flow](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/intune-customer-success/windows-autopilot-mfa-changes-to-enrollment-flow/ba-p/2774687).

#### Manage Windows 10 security updates for Windows 10 Enterprise multi-session VMs<!-- 8682461 -->
You can now use the [settings catalog](../configuration/settings-catalog.md) to manage Windows Update settings for quality (security) updates for Windows Enterprise [multi-session VMs](../fundamentals/azure-virtual-desktop-multi-session.md). To find the settings, you can use with multi-session VMs in the settings catalog:

1. Create a device configuration policy for Windows 10 that uses the settings catalog, and configure [Settings filter](../fundamentals/azure-virtual-desktop-multi-session.md#to-configure-policies) for *Enterprise multi-session*.

2. Next, expand the *Windows Update for Business* category to select from the update settings that are available for multi-session VMs.

<a name='new-azure-ad-device-id-and-intune-device-id-search-parameters-added--10510385---'></a>

#### New Microsoft Entra device ID and Intune device ID search parameters added<!--10510385 -->

When searching devices in **Devices** > **All devices**, you can now search by Microsoft Entra device ID or Intune Device ID. For a list of available device details available in Intune, see [View device details with Microsoft Intune](../remote-actions/device-inventory.md).  

### Device security

#### Tenant attach: Device status for endpoint security policies
<!--IN9264837 -->

You can review the status of endpoint security policies for tenant attached devices. The **Device Status** page can be accessed for all endpoint security policy types for tenant-attached clients. For more information, see [Device status](../../configmgr/tenant-attach/atp-onboard.md#device-status-preview) for the endpoint security policy types.

#### Attack surface reduction profiles for Configuration Manager tenant attach<!--7323386   -->

We've added two endpoint security profiles for *attack surface reduction* policy that you can use with devices you manage with [Configuration Manager tenant attach](../../configmgr/tenant-attach/deploy-asr-policy.md). These profiles are in preview and manage the same settings as the similarly  named profiles you use for devices managed by Intune. You'll find these new profiles when you configure attack surface reduction policy for the *Windows 10 and later (ConfigMgr)* platform.

The new profiles for tenant attach:

- **Exploit Protection(ConfigMgr)(preview)** - Exploit protection helps protect against malware that uses exploits to infect devices and spread. Exploit protection consists of many mitigations that can be applied to either the operating system or individual apps.
- **Web Protection (ConfigMgr)(preview)** - Web protection in Microsoft Defender for Endpoint uses network protection to secure your machines against web threats. Web protection stops web threats without a web proxy and can protect machines while they are away or on premises. Web protection stops access to phishing sites, malware vectors, exploit sites, untrusted or low-reputation sites, and sites that you have blocked in your custom indicator list.

#### Expanded support for Windows Defender Security Center  for tenant attach devices<!-- 7323443   -->

We've updated the *Windows Security experience (preview)* profile in endpoint security *Antivirus* policy to support more settings for devices you manage with [Configuration Manager tenant attach](../../configmgr/tenant-attach/deploy-antivirus-policy.md). 

Previously, this profile was limited to Tamper Protection for your tenant attached devices. The updated profile now includes settings for the Windows Defender Security Center. You can [use these new settings](../protect/antivirus-microsoft-defender-settings-windows-tenant-attach.md) to manage the same details for tenant attached devices that you already manage with the similarly named profile for Intune managed devices.

For more information about this profile, see [Endpoint security Antivirus policy](../protect/endpoint-security-antivirus-policy.md#devices-managed-by-configuration-manager).

### Intune apps

#### Notifications from the iOS/iPadOS Company Portal app<!-- 10565849  -->

Notifications from the iOS/iPadOS Company Portal app are now delivered to devices using the default Apple sound, rather than being delivered silently. To turn the notification sound off from the iOS/iPadOS Company Portal app, select **Settings** > **Notifications** > **Comp Portal** and select the **Sound** toggle. For more information, see [Company Portal app notifications](../apps/company-portal-app.md#company-portal-app-notifications).

### Monitor and troubleshoot

#### Organizational report focused on device configuration<!-- 8455708  --> 
We have released a new **Device configuration** organizational report. This report replaces the existing **Assignment status** report found in the [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431) under **Devices** > **Monitor**. The **Device configuration** report allows you to generate a list of profiles in the tenant that have devices in a state of success, error, conflict, or not applicable. You can use filters for the profile type, OS, and state. The returned results will provide search, sort, filter, pagination, and export capabilities. In addition to device configuration details, this report provides resource access details, and new settings catalog profile details. For more information, see [Intune Reports](../fundamentals/reports.md).

#### Updated support experience in Microsoft Intune admin center<!-- 8920053   -->

Available for Intune and co-management support flows, we've updated an improved [support experience](../../get-support.md#updated-support-experience) in the Microsoft Intune admin center. The new experience guides you to issue-specific troubleshooting insights and web-based solutions, to get you a resolution faster.

To learn more about this change, see the [support blog post](https://aka.ms/EndpointManager-support-experience).

#### Safeguard holds are now visible in the Feature update failures report<!--10948779   -->

When a device is blocked from installing a Windows update due to a [safeguard hold](/windows/deployment/update/safeguard-holds), you can view details about that hold in the Microsoft Intune admin center > [Feature update failures report](../protect/windows-update-reports.md#use-the-feature-update-failures-operational-report).

A device with a safeguard hold appears as a device with an error in the report. When you view details for such a device, the *Alert Message* column displays **Safeguard Hold**, and the *Deployment Error Code* column displays the ID of the safeguard hold.

Microsoft occasionally places safeguard holds to block installation of an update on a device when something detected on that device is known to result in a poor post-update experience. For example, software or drivers are common reasons to place a safeguard hold. The hold remains in place until the underlying issue is resolved, and the update is safe to install.

To learn more about active safeguard holds and expectations for their resolution, go to the Windows release health dashboard at [https://aka.ms/WindowsReleaseHealth](/windows/release-health/).  

#### Update to the Assignment failures operational report<!-- 6473096  -->

[Security baselines](../protect/security-baselines.md) and endpoint security profiles have been added to the existing **Assignment failures** report. The profile types are differentiated using the **Policy type** column with the ability to filter. Role-based access control (RBAC) permissions have been applied to the report to filter on the set of policies that an admin can see. Those RBAC permissions include the Security Baseline permission, the Device Configuration permission, and the Device Compliance Policies permission. The report shows the number of devices in a state of error and conflict for a given profile. You can drill down into a detailed list of those devices or users and into the setting details. You can find the **Assignment failures** report in [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431) by selecting **Devices** > **Monitor**, or by selecting **Endpoint Security** > **Monitor**. For more information, see [Assignment failures report (Operational)](../fundamentals/reports.md#assignment-failures-report-operational).

#### Confirm Tunnel Gateway servers can access your internal network from within the Microsoft Intune admin center<!-- 9840576    -->

We've added the capability to the Microsoft Intune admin center to confirm that your Tunnel Gateway servers can access your internal network, without someone having to access the servers directly. To enable this feature, you'll configure a new option called *URL for internal network access check* in the properties of each Tunnel Gateway site.

After adding a URL from your internal network to a Tunnel Gateway site, each server in that site periodically attempts to access it, and then reports on the result.

The status for this internal network access check is reported as *Internal network accessibility* on a server's [*Health check* tab](../protect/microsoft-tunnel-monitor.md#use-the-admin-center-ui). Status values for this check include:

- **Healthy** - The server can access the URL specified in the site properties.
- **Unhealthy** - The server can't access the URL specified in the site properties.
- **Unknown** - This status appears when you haven't set a URL in the site properties, and doesn't affect the overall status of the site.

Your servers will need to upgrade to the latest version of the Tunnel Gateway server software for this feature to work.

#### Compliance setting for SafetyNet hardware-backed key attestation for Android Enterprise personally owned work profile<!--8903071  -->

We've added a new device compliance setting for Android Enterprise personally owned work profile devices, [Required SafetyNet evaluation type](../protect/compliance-policy-create-android-for-work.md#google-play-protect---for-personally owned-work-profile). This new setting becomes available after you configure *SafetyNet device attestation* to either *Check basic integrity* or *Check basic integrity & certified devices*. The new setting:

**Required SafetyNet evaluation type**:

- **Not configured (defaults to basic evaluation)** – This setting is the setting default.
- **Hardware-backed key** – Require that hardware-backed key attestation is used for SafetyNet evaluation. Devices that don't support hardware-backed key attestation are marked as not compliant.

For more information about SafetyNet and which devices support hardware-backed key attestation, see [Evaluation types](https://developer.android.com/training/safetynet/attestation#evaluation-types) in the SafetyNet documentation for Android.

#### Use Intune policy to expedite installation of Windows 10/11 security updates<!-- 5584682    -->

In public preview, you can use Intune's **Windows 10 quality updates** policy to [expedite the install of the most recent Windows 10/11 security updates](../protect/windows-10-expedite-updates.md) to devices you manage with Intune.

When you expedite an update, devices can start the download and install of the update as soon as possible, without having to wait for the device to check in for updates. Other than expediting the install of the update, use of this policy leaves your existing update deployment policies and processes untouched.

To help monitor expedited updates, you can use the following options:

- The [Windows Expedited Updates report](../protect/windows-10-expedite-updates.md#summary-report)
- [Expedited update failures](../protect/windows-10-expedite-updates.md#device-report) device report

### Device security

#### Windows Security experience profiles support tri-state settings<!-- 9741752  -->

For Windows 10 devices, we've updated the bi-state settings to be tri-state settings in the [Windows Security experience profile](../protect/antivirus-security-experience-windows-settings.md) for Endpoint security Antivirus policy.

Most settings in the profile previously supported only two options of **Yes** and **Not configured**.  Moving forward, those same settings now include **Yes**, **Not configured**, and a new option of **No**.

- For existing profiles, settings that are set to *Not configured* remain as *Not configured*. When you create new profiles or edit an existing profile, you can now choose to explicitly specify *No*.

Also, the following information applies to configuration of the *Hide the Virus and threat protection area in the Windows Security app* setting and its child *Hide the Ransomware data recovery option in the Windows Security app* setting:

- If the parent setting (Hide the Virus and threat protection area) was set to *Not configured* and the child setting was set to *Yes*, then the parent and child settings are set to *Not configured*.

#### New Microsoft Tunnel Gateway version<!--10145583-->  
We've released a [new version](../protect/microsoft-tunnel-upgrade.md#microsoft-tunnel-update-history) of the Microsoft Tunnel Gateway. It includes the following changes:

- Minor bug fixes.
- Image updates with security updates for all dependencies.

For sites that are configured to update automatically, the Tunnel Gateway server will automatically update to the new version. For sites that are configured to update manually, you'll need to approve the update.

#### Conditional access on Jamf-managed macOS devices for Government Cloud now available<!--9081124 -->  
You can now use Intune's compliance engine to evaluate Jamf-managed macOS devices for Government Cloud. To do so, activate the compliance connector for Jamf. For more information, see [Integrate Jamf Pro with Intune for compliance](../protect/conditional-access-integrate-jamf.md).

#### Changes for the Microsoft Tunnel Gateway<!--6305140     -->  
We have a pair of updates to announce for the Microsoft Tunnel Gateway this month:

- **Microsoft Tunnel Gateway is now generally available**  
  With this service release, [Microsoft Tunnel Gateway](../protect/microsoft-tunnel-overview.md) is now out of preview, and generally available. While the Microsoft Tunnel Gateway server component is out of preview, the following Microsoft Tunnel client apps remain in preview:

  - Microsoft Tunnel standalone app for Android
  - Microsoft Tunnel standalone app for iOS
  - Microsoft Defender for Endpoint with support for Microsoft Tunnel for Android

- **Custom setting support in VPN profiles for Microsoft Tunnel for Microsoft Defender for Endpoint for Android**

  When you use the Microsoft Defender for Endpoint as your Microsoft Tunnel client app for Android and as a mobile threat defense (MTD) app, you can now use [custom settings](../protect/microsoft-tunnel-configure.md#use-custom-settings-for-microsoft-defender-for-endpoint) in the VPN Profile for Microsoft Tunnel to configure Microsoft Defender for Endpoint.

  In this scenario, using custom settings to configure Microsoft Defender for Endpoint in the VPN profile removes the need to deploy a separate app configuration profile for Microsoft Defender for Endpoint.

  For the following platforms, you can choose to use either the custom settings in the VPN profile or to use a separate app configuration profile for Microsoft Defender for Endpoint:

  - Android Enterprise Fully Managed
  - Android Enterprise Corporate-Owned Work Profile

  However, for an Android Enterprise Personally Owned Work profile, use *only* the VPN profile with custom settings. Personally Owned Work Profile devices that receive a separate app configuration profile for Microsoft Defender for Endpoint and a Microsoft Tunnel VPN profile might be unable to connect to the Microsoft Tunnel.

This setting ensures that you can vet all OS releases before end users are actively using new OS functionality on iOS devices. In [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431), select **Apps** > **App protection policies**. For more information, see [How to create and assign app protection policies](../apps/app-protection-policies.md).

### Device configuration

### New modern authentication method with Apple Setup Assistant (public preview)<!--4843770 -->

When creating an Automated Device Enrollment profile, you can now choose a new authentication method: **Setup Assistant with modern authentication**. This method provides all the security from Setup Assistant but avoids the issue of leaving end users stuck on a device they can't use while the Company Portal installs on the device. The user has to authenticate using Microsoft Entra multifactor authentication during the setup assistant screens. To gain access to corporate resources protected by Conditional Access, this feature requires another Microsoft Entra sign-in post-enrollment in the Company Portal app. The correct Company Portal version will automatically be sent down as a required app to the device for iOS/iPadOS. For macOS, here are the options to get the Company Portal on the device - [Add the Company Portal for macOS app](../apps/apps-company-portal-macos.md).

Enrollment is completed once the user lands on the home screen, and users can freely use the device for resources not protected by Conditional Access. User affinity is established when the user lands on the home screen after the setup screens. However, the device isn't fully registered with Microsoft Entra ID until the Company Portal sign in. The device will not show up in a given user's device list in the Microsoft Entra admin center until the Company Portal sign in. If the tenant has multifactor authentication turned on for these devices or users, the users will be asked to complete multifactor authentication during enrollment during Setup Assistant. Multifactor authentication isn't required, but it's available for this authentication method within Conditional Access if needed.

This method has the following options for installing the Company Portal:

- For iOS/iPadOS: The **Install Company Portal** setting will not be there when choosing this flow for iOS/iPadOS. The Company Portal app will be a required app on the device with the correct app configuration policy on the device when the end user goes to the home screen. To gain access to resources protected by Conditional Access and be fully Microsoft Entra registered, after enrollment, users must sign in to the Company Portal app with Microsoft Entra credentials.
- For macOS: Users must sign into the Company Portal to complete Microsoft Entra registration and gain access to resources protected by Conditional Access. The end user will not be locked to the Company Portal app after landing on the home page. But, another sign-in into the Company Portal app is required to access corporate resources and be compliant.  For more information, see [Add the macOS Company Portal app](../apps/apps-company-portal-macos.md).

For information on how to use this authentication method on iOS/iPadOS devices, see [Automatically enroll iOS/iPadOS devices by using Apple's Automated Device Enrollment](../enrollment/device-enrollment-program-enroll-ios.md#create-an-apple-enrollment-profile).

For information on how to use this authentication method on macOS devices, see [Automatically enroll macOS devices with the Apple Business Manager or Apple School Manager](../enrollment/device-enrollment-program-enroll-macos.md#create-an-apple-enrollment-profile).

#### Updated OEMConfig policy reporting for Android Enterprise devices<!-- 5255334   -->  
On Android Enterprise devices, you can create an OEMConfig policy to add, create, and customize OEM-specific settings. Now, the policy reporting is updated to also show success on a user, a device, and for each setting in the policy.

For more information, see [Use and manage Android Enterprise devices with OEMConfig in Microsoft Intune](../configuration/android-oem-configuration-overview.md).

Applies to:

- Android Enterprise

#### Disable NFC pairing on iOS/iPadOS devices running 14.2 and newer<!-- 9112701   -->  
On supervised iOS/iPadOS devices, you can create a device restrictions profile that disables NFC (**Devices** > **Configuration** > **Create** > **iOS/iPadOS** for platform > **Device restrictions** for profile > **Connected devices** > **Disable near field communication (NFC)**). When you disable this feature, it prevents devices from pairing with other NFC-enabled devices, and disables NFC.

To see this setting, go to [iOS and iPadOS device settings to allow or restrict features using Intune](../configuration/device-restrictions-ios.md).

#### Intune support for provisioning Microsoft Entra shared devices<!--9585326 -->

The ability to provision Android Enterprise dedicated devices with Microsoft Authenticator automatically configured into Microsoft Entra shared device mode is now Generally Available. For more info on how to use this enrollment type, see [Set up Intune enrollment of Android Enterprise dedicated devices](../enrollment/android-kiosk-enroll.md).

#### View end of support details for your feature update profiles<!-- 9699729   -->

To help you plan for end-of-service for Windows 10 feature updates you deploy with Intune, there are new columns of information to [Feature Updates profiles](../protect/windows-10-feature-updates.md#manage-feature-updates-for-windows-10-and-later-policy) in the Microsoft Intune admin center.

The first new column displays a status. This status identifies when the update in the profile is near or has reached its end of service. The second column displays that end of service date. When an update reaches its end of service, it's no longer deployed to devices, and the policy can be removed from Intune.

The new columns and details include:

- **Support** – This column displays the status of the feature update:
  - **Supported** – The update is supported for distribution.
  - **Support ending** – The update is within two months of its end of service date.
  - **Not supported** – The update is no longer supported, having reached its end of service date.

- **Support End Date** – This column displays the end-of-service date for the feature update in the profile.

This support requires the device have a user, such as devices enrolled as:

- Android Enterprise fully managed
- Android Enterprise personally owned work profile

User attributes are not supported for devices that don't have user associations, such as devices that are enrolled as Android Enterprise dedicated. For example, when there isn't a user on the device, a profile that uses `CN={{UserPrincipalName}}` in the subject or SAN can't get the user principal name.

#### Use app protection policies for Defender for Endpoint on Android and iOS<!-- 6486982   7362746  -->  
You can now use [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint in app protection policies for devices that run Android or iOS](../protect/advanced-threat-protection-configure.md#create-and-assign-app-protection-policy-to-set-device-risk-level).

You can now configure the rule named **Block persistence through WMI event subscription** as part of an [Attack surface reduction rules](../protect/endpoint-security-asr-policy.md#attack-surface-reduction-profiles) profile in Endpoint security.

This rule prevents malware from abusing WMI to attain persistence on a device. Fileless threats employ various tactics to stay hidden, to avoid being seen in the file system, and to gain periodic execution control. Some threats can abuse the WMI repository and event model to stay hidden.

When configured as [setting for *Attack surface reduction*](../protect/endpoint-security-asr-profile-settings.md#attack-surface-reduction-rules-profile) policy for Endpoint security, the following options are available:
- **Not configured** (default) – The setting returns to the Windows default, which is off and persistence isn't blocked.
- **Block** – Persistence through WMI is blocked.
- **Audit** – Evaluate how this rule affects your organization if it's enabled (set to Block).
- **Disable** - Turn this rule off. Persistence isn't blocked.

This rule doesn't support the *Warn* option, and is also available as a Device configuration setting from the [Settings catalog](../configuration/settings-catalog.md).

#### Locale support in email notifications for non-compliance<!--7604191    -->  
Compliance policies now support [Notification message templates](../protect/actions-for-noncompliance.md#create-a-notification-message-template) that include separate messages for different locales. Support for multiple languages no longer requires you to create separate templates and policies for each locale.

When you configure locale-specific messages in a template, noncompliant end users receive the appropriate localized email notification message based on their Microsoft 365 preferred language. You also designate one localized message in the template as the *default* message. The default message is sent to users that haven't set a preferred language or when the template doesn't include a specific message for their locale.

### Device enrollment

#### Hide more screens for the Apple Automated Device Enrollment Setup Assistant<!--7786092   -->  
You can now set Automated Device Enrollment (ADE) profiles to hide these Setup Assistant Screens for iOS/iPadOS 14.0+ and macOS 11+ devices:

### Device security

#### Intune support for Microsoft Defender Application Guard now includes isolated Windows environments<!-- 8274282     -->  
When you configure **Turn on Application Guard**  in an Intune [App and browser isolation profile](../protect/endpoint-security-asr-profile-settings.md#app-and-browser-isolation) in Endpoint security Attack surface reduction policy, you can choose from the following options when you enable Application Guard:

- **Microsoft Edge** - *Previously available*
- **Isolated Windows environments** - *New with this update*
- **Microsoft Edge** ***and*** **isolated Windows environments** - *New with this update*

Before this release, the setting was named *Turn on Application Guard for Edge (Options)*.

The new options for this setting expand Application Guard support beyond just URLs for Edge. You can now enable Application Guard to help protect devices by opening potential threats in a hardware isolated Windows VM environment (container). For example, with support for isolated Windows environments, Application Guard can open untrusted Office documents in an isolated Windows VM.

With this change:

- Intune now supports the full range of values found in the Windows MDM CSP: [AllowWindowsDefenderApplicationGuard](/windows/client-management/mdm/windowsdefenderapplicationguard-csp).
- To help you understand the effect on device users when using isolated Windows environments, see [Application Guard testing scenarios](/windows/security/threat-protection/microsoft-defender-application-guard/test-scenarios-md-app-guard) in the Windows security documentation.
- Read more about Application Guard and support for Office apps in [Application Guard for Office](/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/install-app-guard?view=o365-worldwide&preserve-view=true) in the Microsoft 365 documentation.

#### New Application Guard settings in Attack surface reduction policy<!-- 8274336   -->  
We've added two new settings to the App and browser isolation profile of Intune's [Endpoint security Attack surface reduction policy](../protect/endpoint-security-asr-policy.md):
- **Application Guard allow camera and microphone access** – Manage access by Application Guard apps to a devices camera and microphone.
- **Application Guard allow use of Root Certificate Authorities from the user's device** – When you specify one or more root certificate thumbprints, the matching certificates are transferred to the Microsoft Defender Application Guard container.

For more information, see the settings for [App and browser isolation](../protect/endpoint-security-asr-profile-settings.md#app-and-browser-isolation).

#### Updates for security baselines<!-- 8391335, 8377369   -->  
We have new versions available for the following [security baselines](../protect/security-baselines.md):

- **[MDM Security baseline (Windows 10 Security)](../protect/security-baseline-settings-mdm-all.md?pivots=december-2020)**
- **[Microsoft Defender for Endpoint baseline](../protect/security-baseline-settings-defender.md?pivots=december-2020)**

Updated baseline versions bring support for recent settings to help you maintain the best-practice configurations recommended by the respective product teams.

To understand what's changed between versions, see [Compare baseline versions](../protect/security-baselines.md) to learn how to export a .CSV file that shows the changes.

#### Endpoint Security Firewall reports<!-- 5653366    -->  
We've added two new reports that are dedicated to Firewall policies in Endpoint Security:

- [Windows 10 MDM devices with firewall off](../protect/endpoint-security-policy.md) is found in the Endpoint security node and displays the list of Windows 10 devices with the Firewall turned off. This report identifies each device by device name, device ID, user information, and the Firewall status.
- [Windows 10 MDM Firewall status](../fundamentals/reports.md#mdm-firewall-status-for-windows-10-and-later-organizational) is an organizational report found in the *Reports* node, which lists the firewall status for your Windows 10 devices. This report displays status information that includes if the firewall is enabled, disabled, limited, or temporarily disabled.

#### Summary view for Defender Antivirus reports<!-- 8846877   -->  
We've updated the view for the Microsoft Defender Antivirus reports found in the **Reports** node of the Microsoft Intune admin center. Now, when you select Microsoft Defender Antivirus in the **Reports** node, you see the default view of the **Summary** tab, and a second tab for **Reports**. The **Reports** tab is where you'll find the previously available [Antivirus agent status](../fundamentals/reports.md#antivirus-agent-status-report-organizational) and [Detected malware](../fundamentals/reports.md#detected-malware-report-organizational) organizational reports.

The new **Summary** tab displays the following information:

- Displays aggregate details for the Antivirus reports.
- Includes a *Refresh* option that updates the counts of devices in each antivirus state.
- Reflects the same data as found in the [Antivirus agent status organizational](../fundamentals/reports.md#antivirus-agent-status-report-organizational) report, which is now accessed from the **Reports** tab.

#### App protection policy support on Android and iOS/iPadOS for more Mobile Threat Defense partners<!-- 8846351  -->

In October of 2019, Intune app protection policy added the capability to use data from our Microsoft Threat Defense partners.

With this update, we're expanding this support to the following partner for using an app protection policy to block or selectively wipe a user's corporate data based on the health of the device:

- **McAfee MVision Mobile** on Android, iOS and iPadOS

For more information, see [Create Mobile Threat Defense app protection policy with Intune](../protect/mtd-app-protection-policy.md).

#### Increased certificate validity period for SCEP and PKCS profiles<!-- 8629805   -->  
Intune now supports a **Certificate validity period** of up to **24** months in certificate profiles for [Simple Certificate Enrollment Protocol](../protect/certificates-profile-scep.md#create-a-scep-certificate-profile) (SCEP) and [Public Key Cryptography Standards](../protect/certificates-pfx-configure.md#create-a-pkcs-certificate-profile) (PKCS). This change is an increase from the previous support period of up to 12 months.

This support applies to Windows and Android. Certificate validity periods are ignored by iOS/iPadOS and macOS.

### Monitor and troubleshoot

#### New co-management eligibility organizational report<!-- 7854306  -->  
The **Co-management eligibility** report provides an eligibility evaluation for devices that can be co-managed. Co-management enables you to concurrently manage Windows 10 devices by using both Configuration Manager and Microsoft Intune.

## January 2021

### App management

#### Application icon update for iOS, macOS, and web Company Portal<!-- 7113985 -->  
We've updated the app icon for the Company Portal for iOS, macOS, and web. This icon is also used by the Company Portal for Windows. End users see the new icon in their device's application launcher and home screen, in Apple's App Store, and in experiences within the Company Portal apps.

#### Android Enterprise system app support in personally owned work profiles<!-- 5291507 -->  
You can now deploy Android Enterprise system apps to Android Enterprise personally owned work profile devices. System apps are apps that don't appear in the Managed Google Play Store and often come pre-installed on the device. Once a system app is deployed, you will be unable to uninstall, hide, or otherwise remove the system app. For related information about system apps, see [Add Android Enterprise system apps to Microsoft Intune](../apps/apps-ae-system.md).

#### Deleting Win32 apps in a dependency relationship<!-- 8997490 -->  
Win32 apps added to Intune cannot be removed if they are in a dependency relationship. These apps can only be deleted after the dependency relationship is removed. This requirement is applied to both parent and child apps in a dependency relationship. Also, this requirement ensures that dependencies are enforced properly and that dependency behavior is more predictable. For more information, see [Win32 app management in Microsoft Intune](../apps/apps-win32-app-management.md).

#### Scope tag support for customization policies<!--6182440  -->  
You can now assign scope tags to Customization policies. To do so, go to [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431) > **Tenant administration** > **Customization** where you see **Scope tags** configuration options. This feature is now available for Intune for Government or Intune operated by 21Vianet.

#### Browser access enabled automatically during Android work profile enrollment<!-- 5411101  -->  
During new Android Enterprise personally owned work profile enrollments, browser access is now automatically enabled on the device. With this change, compliant devices can use the browser to access resources that are protected by conditional access without needing to take other actions. Before this change, users had to launch the Company Portal and select **Settings** > **Enable Browser Access** > **Enable**.

This change has no effect on devices that are already enrolled.

#### Win32 app download progress bar<!-- 5145837 -->  
End users will now see a progress bar in the Windows Company Portal while a Win32 app is being downloaded. This feature will help customers better understand the app installation progress.

#### Update to Company Portal for Android app icon<!-- 7114401 -->  
We've updated the Company Portal for Android app icon to create a more modern look and feel for device users. To see what the new icon looks like, go to the [Intune Company Portal listing on Google Play](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2151341).

### Device configuration

#### Microsoft Tunnel now supports Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8<!-- 8981769 -->  
You can now use Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 8 with the [Microsoft Tunnel](../protect/microsoft-tunnel-prerequisites.md#linux-server). To use RHEL 8, you won't need to take any actions. Support has been added to the Docker containers, which update automatically. In addition, this update also suppresses some extraneous logging.

#### New version of the PFX Certificate Connector<!-- 9139477 -->  
We've released a new version of the PFX Certificate Connector, version **6.2009.1.9**. This new connector version:

- Improvements to the renewal of the connector certificate.

For more information about certificate connectors, including a list of connector releases for both certificate connectors, see [Certificate connectors](../protect/certificate-connectors.md).

### Monitor and troubleshoot

#### Update when exporting Intune reports using the Graph API<!-- 8764428 -->  
When you use the `exportJobs` Graph API to export Intune reports without selecting any columns for the devices report, you will receive the default column set. To reduce confusion, we have removed columns from the default column set. The removed columns are `PhoneNumberE164Format`, `_ComputedComplianceState`, `_OS`, and `OSDescription`. These columns are still available for selection if you need them, but only explicitly, and not by default. If you have built automation around the default columns of the device export, and that automation uses any of these columns, you need to refactor your processes to explicitly select these and any other relevant columns. For more information, see [Export Intune reports using Graph APIs](../fundamentals/reports-export-graph-apis.md).


## December 2020

### Intune apps

#### Newly available protected apps for Intune<!-- 8766223 -->  
The following protected apps are now available for Microsoft Intune:

## November 2020

<!-- vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv -->
### App management

#### Improvements to work profile messaging in Company Portal for Android<!--8378333  -->

We've updated messaging in Company Portal for Android to better introduce and explain how work profile works. The new messaging appears:

* After the work profile setup flow: Users see a new informational screen explaining where to find work apps, with links to help documentation.
* When a user accidentally re-enables the Company Portal app in the personal profile: We redesigned a screen (**Your device now has a profile just for work**) with clearer explanations and new illustrations to guide users to their work apps, with links to help documentation.
* On the **Help** page: In the **Frequently Asked Questions** section, there's a new link to help documentation about how to set up work profile and find apps.

#### PowerShell scripts execute before apps, and time out reduced<!-- 8829670 -->

There are some updates to PowerShell scripts:

- Microsoft Intune management extension execution flow is reverted back to processing PowerShell scripts first, and then running Win32 apps.
- To resolve an Enrollment Status Page (ESP) time out issue, PowerShell scripts time out after 30 minutes. Previously, they timed out after 60 minutes.

For more information, see [Use PowerShell scripts on Windows 10 devices in Intune](../apps/intune-management-extension.md).

<!-- vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv -->
### Device configuration

#### Power menu, status bar notifications, and more restrictive settings available for Android Enterprise dedicated devices<!-- 6184533  -->
On Intune enrolled Android Enterprise dedicated devices running single or multi-app kiosk mode, you can:
- Restrict the power menu, system error warnings, and access to the Settings app.
- Choose if users can see the home and overview buttons, and notifications.

#### New show previews setting for app notifications on iOS/iPadOS devices<!-- 8351845   -->

On iOS/iPadOS devices, there's a **Show Previews** setting (**Devices** > **Configuration** > **Create** > **iOS/iPadOS** for platform > **Device features** for profile > **App Notifications**). Use this setting to choose when recent app notification previews are shown on devices.

For more information on app notification settings, and other settings you can configure, see [device settings to use common iOS/iPadOS features](../configuration/ios-device-features-settings.md).

#### On-demand rules with Microsoft Tunnel for iOS<!-- 8460915    -->

The Microsoft Tunnel now supports [on-demand rules for iOS/iPad devices](../protect/microsoft-tunnel-configure.md#ios). With on-demand rules, you can specify the use of the VPN when conditions are met for specific FQDNs or IP addresses.

To configure on-demand rules for iOS/iPadOS with Microsoft Tunnel, configure a VPN Profile for iOS/iPadOS as part of device configuration policy. On the profiles *Configuration settings* page, select *Microsoft Tunnel* as the *Connection type* and you'll then have access to configure **On-Demand VPN Rules**.

For information about the on-demand VPN rules you can configure, see [Automatic VPN settings](../configuration/vpn-settings-ios.md#automatic-vpn).

Applies to:
- iOS/iPadOS

#### More authentication settings for Wi-Fi profiles on Windows 10 and newer devices<!-- 7980773 -->

New settings and features for Wi-Fi profiles on devices running Windows 10 and newer (**Devices** > **Configuration** > **Create** > **Windows 10 and later** for platform > **Wi-Fi** for profile > **Enterprise**):

- **Authentication mode**: Authenticate the user, device, either, or use guest authentication.
- **Remember credentials at each logon**: Force users to enter credentials whenever they connect to the VPN. Or, cache the credentials so users only enter their credentials once.
- More granular control over authentication behavior, including:
  - Authentication period
  - Authentication retry delay period
  - Start period
  - Maximum EAPOL-Start messages
  - Maximum authentication failures

- **Use separate VLANs for device and user authentication**: When using single sign-on, the Wi-Fi profile can use a different virtual LAN based on the user's credentials. Your Wi-Fi server must support this feature.

To see these settings, and all the settings you can configure, go to [Add Wi-Fi settings for Windows 10 and later devices in Intune](../configuration/wi-fi-settings-windows.md).

Applies to:
- Windows 10 and newer

<!-- vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv -->
### Device management

#### Personally owned work profile terminology<!--8361769   -->

To avoid confusion, the term for the *work profile* Android Enterprise management scenario will be changed to "personally owned devices with a work profile" or *personally owned work profile* throughout the Intune documentation and user interface. This change differentiates it from the "corporate-owned work profile" (COPE) management scenario.

#### Windows Autopilot for HoloLens 2 (preview)<!--6305220   -->

Windows Autopilot for HoloLens 2 devices is now in public preview. Admins no longer have to register their tenants for flighting. For more information on using Autopilot for HoloLens, see [Windows Autopilot for HoloLens 2](/hololens/hololens2-autopilot).

#### Ending support for iOS 11<!--7327321  -->

Intune enrollment and the Company Portal now support iOS versions 12 and later. Older versions aren't supported but will continue to receive policies.


#### Ending support for macOS 10.12<!--7327326  -->
Since macOS Big Sur has released, Intune enrollment and the Company Portal now support macOS versions 10.13 and later. Older versions aren't supported.


<!-- vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv -->
### Device security

#### New setting for Device Control profile for endpoint security<!-- 8456551     -->

We've added a new setting, **Block write access to removable storage** to the [Device control profile](../protect/endpoint-security-account-protection-profile-settings.md)  for Attack surface reduction policy in endpoint security.  When set to *Yes*, write access to removable storage is blocked.

#### Improvements to settings in Attack surface reduction rule profiles <!-- 7319334     -->

We've updated the options for applicable [settings in the Attack surface reduction rule profile](../protect/endpoint-security-asr-profile-settings.md#attack-surface-reduction-rules-profile), which is part of endpoint securities Attack surface reduction policy.

We've brought consistency across settings to existing options, like *Disable* and *Enable*, and added a new option, *Warn*:

- **Warn** - On devices that run Windows 10 version 1809 or later, the device user receives a message that they can bypass the setting. For example, on the setting *Block Adobe Reader from creating child processes*, the option of *Warn* presents users with the option to bypass that block and allow Adobe Reader to create a child process. On devices that run earlier versions of Windows 10, the rule enforces the behavior without the option to bypass it.


#### Policy merge support for USB device IDs in Device control profiles for endpoint security Attack surface reduction policy<!-- 7645254   -->

We've added support for *policy merge* of USB device IDs to the [Device control](../protect/endpoint-security-asr-policy.md) profile for the endpoint security Attack surface reduction policy. The following settings from *device control* profiles are evaluated for policy merge:
- Allow hardware device installation by device identifiers
- Block hardware device installation by device identifiers
- Allow hardware device installation by setup classes
- Block hardware device installation by setup classes
- Allow hardware device installation by device instance identifiers
- Block hardware device installation by device instance identifiers

Policy merge applies to the configuration of each setting across the different profiles that apply to a device. It doesn't include evaluation between different settings, even when two settings are closely related.

For a more detailed example of what merges, and how to allow and blocklists for each supported setting gets merged and applies on a device, see [Policy merge for settings](../protect/endpoint-security-asr-policy.md#policy-merge-for-settings) for device control profiles.

#### Improved Antivirus status operations report for endpoint security<!-- 7771023   -->

We've added new details to the [Antivirus status operations](reports.md#antivirus-agent-status-report-organizational) report for Windows Defender Antivirus, which is an endpoint security policy report.

The following new columns of information will be available for each device:

- **Product status** – The status of Windows Defender on the device.
- **Tamper protection** – Is tamper protection enabled or disabled.
- **Virtual machine** – Is the device a virtual machine, or physical device.

#### Improved rule merge for Attack surface reduction rules<!--7798290      -->

Attack surface reduction rules now support new behavior for merger of settings from different policies, to create a superset of policy for each device. Only the settings that are not in conflict are merged, while settings that are in conflict are not added to the superset of rules. Previously, if two policies included conflicts for a single setting, both policies were flagged as being in conflict, and no settings from either profile would be deployed.

Attack surface reduction rule merge behavior is as follows:

- Attack surface reduction rules from the following profiles are evaluated for each device the rules apply to:
  - Devices > Configuration policy > Endpoint protection profile > Microsoft Defender Exploit Guard > [Attack Surface Reduction](../protect/endpoint-protection-windows-10.md#attack-surface-reduction).
  - Endpoint security > Attack surface reduction policy > [Attack surface reduction rules](../protect/endpoint-security-asr-policy.md#attack-surface-reduction-profiles).
  - Endpoint security > Security baselines > Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Baseline > [Attack Surface Reduction Rules](../protect/security-baseline-settings-defender.md#attack-surface-reduction-rules).
- Settings that don't have conflicts are added to a superset of policy for the device.
- When two or more policies have conflicting settings, the conflicting settings are not added to the combined policy. Settings that don't conflict are added to the superset policy that applies to a device.
- Only the configurations for conflicting settings are held back.

#### MVISION Mobile – New Mobile Threat Defense partner <!-- 8112625  -->

You can control mobile device access to corporate resources using Conditional Access based on risk assessment conducted by [MVISION Mobile](../protect/trellix-mobile-threat-defense-connector.md), a Mobile Threat Defense solution from McAfee that integrates with Microsoft Intune.

<!-- vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv -->
### Monitor and troubleshoot

#### New Intune operational report to help troubleshoot configuration profile issues<!-- 6471222  -->

A new **Assignment failures** operational report is available in public preview to help troubleshoot errors and conflicts for configuration profiles that have been targeted to devices. This report will show a list of configuration profiles for the tenant and the number of devices in a state of error or conflict. Using this information, you can drill down to a profile to see a list of devices and users in a failure state related to the profile.

### App management

#### Apps that require enrollment are hidden when enrollment is set to unavailable<!-- 6305901  -->

Apps assigned with the **Available for enrolled devices** and **Required** intents won't be displayed in the Company Portal for users where the device enrollment setting is set to **Unavailable**. This change is only applicable when viewing the Company Portal app or website from an unenrolled device, including unenrolled devices with MAM managed applications. The apps will still be visible for users viewing the Company Portal from an enrolled device, regardless of the value of the **Device enrollment** setting. For more information, see [Device enrollment setting options](../apps/company-portal-app.md#device-enrollment-setting-options).

#### Improvements to iOS Company Portal privacy message customization<!-- 7006929  -->

You now have greater ability to customize the privacy messaging in the iOS Company Portal. In addition to the previous support for being able to customize what your organization *can't see*, you can customize what your organization *can see* in the privacy message displayed to end users in the iOS Company Portal. To support this feature, devices will need to be running at least Company Portal version 4.11 to see the customized messaging about what can be seen. This feature will be available in the [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431) by selecting **Tenant administration** > **Customization**. For more information, see the Company Portal [Privacy](../apps/company-portal-app.md#privacy) message.

#### Android app protection policies (MAM) on COPE devices<!-- 7088497  -->

Newly added Mobile Application Management (MAM) support enables Android app protection policies on Android Enterprise corporate-owned devices with a work profile (COPE). For more information about app protection policies, see [App protection policies overview](../apps/app-protection-policy.md#app-protection-experience-for-android-devices).

#### Max Company Portal version age for Android devices<!-- 5151625  -->

You can set an age limit as the maximum number of days for the Company Portal app version for Android devices. This setting ensures that end users are within a certain range of Company Portal app releases (in days). When the setting for the devices isn't met, the selected action for this setting is triggered. Actions include **Block access**, **Wipe data**, or **Warn**. You can find this setting in the [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431) by selecting **Apps** > **App protection policies** > **Create policy**. The **Max Company Portal version age (days)** setting will be available in the **Device conditions** section of the **Conditional launch** step. For more information, see [Android app protection policy settings - Conditional launch](../apps/app-protection-policy-settings-android.md#conditional-launch).

#### Mac LOB apps will be supported as managed apps on macOS 11 and higher<!-- 7750527  -->

Intune supports the **Install as managed** app property that can be configured for Mac line-of-business (LOB) apps deployed to macOS 11 and higher. When this setting is on, the Mac LOB app will be installed as a managed app on supported devices (macOS 11 and higher). Managed line-of-business apps can be removed using the **uninstall** assignment type on supported devices (macOS 11 and higher). In addition, removing the MDM profile removes all managed apps from the device.

Specifically, device context PowerShell scripts work on WPJ devices, but user context PowerShell scripts are ignored, which is by design. User context scripts will be ignored on WPJ devices and will not be reported to the Microsoft Intune console. For more information about PowerShell, see [Use PowerShell scripts on Windows 10 devices in Intune](../apps/intune-management-extension.md).

<!-- vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv -->
### Device configuration

#### Device Firmware Configuration Interface (DFCI) is generally available<!-- 5858274 -->

DFCI is an open-source Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) framework. It allows you to securely manage the UEFI (BIOS) settings of your Windows Autopilot devices using Microsoft Intune. It also limits end-user control over firmware configurations.

Unlike traditional UEFI management, DFCI removes the need for managing third-party solutions. It also provides zero-touch firmware management by using Microsoft Intune for cloud management. DFCI also accesses the existing Windows Autopilot device information for authorization.

For more information on this feature, see [Use DFCI profiles on Windows devices in Intune](../configuration/device-firmware-configuration-interface-windows.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> DFCI policy reporting in the Intune admin center wasn't working as expected. All policies reported a "Pending" status. This behavior is fixed.

#### Use the Connect Automatically setting on Android Enterprise basic Wi-Fi profiles<!-- 6329130   -->

On Android Enterprise devices, you can create basic Wi-Fi profiles that include common Wi-Fi settings, such as the connection name. You can configure the **Connect automatically** setting that automatically connects to your Wi-Fi network when devices are in range.

To see these settings, go to [Add Wi-Fi settings for Android Enterprise dedicated and fully managed devices](../configuration/wi-fi-settings-android-enterprise.md).

- Android Enterprise Fully Managed, Dedicated, and Corporate-Owned Work Profile

#### New user experience and new Enable direct download setting on macOS devices using associated domains<!-- 7739958   -->

When you create an Associated Domain configuration profile on macOS devices, the user experience is updated (**Devices** > **Configuration** > **Create** > **macOS** for platform > **Device features** for profile > **Associated domains**). You still enter your App ID and Domains.

On macOS 11+ supervised devices enrolled with user approved device enrollment or automated device enrollment, you can use the **Enable direct download** setting. Enabling direct downloads allows domain data to downloaded directly from the devices, instead of downloading through a content delivery network (CDN).

For more information, see [Associated domains on macOS devices](../configuration/macos-device-features-settings.md#associated-domains).

Applies to:
- macOS 11+ (supervised)

#### New lockout password settings on macOS devices<!-- 7780272   -->

New settings are available when you create a macOS password profile (**Devices** > **Configuration** > **Create** > **macOS** for platform > **Device restrictions** for profile > **Password**):

- **Maximum allowed sign-in attempts**: The maximum number of times users can try to consecutively sign in before the device locks them out, is from 2-11. Set this value to a higher number. Setting this value to 2 or 3 isn't recommended, as mistakes are common.

  Applies to all enrollment types.

- **Lockout duration**: Choose how long the lockout lasts, in minutes. During a device lockout, the sign-in screen is inactive, and users can't sign in. When the lockout duration ends, user can sign in again. To use this setting, configure the **Maximum allowed sign-in attempts** setting.

  Applies to macOS 10.10 and newer, and all enrollment types.

To see these settings, go to [macOS password device restrictions](../configuration/device-restrictions-macos.md#password).

Applies to:
- macOS

#### Required password type default setting is changing on Android Enterprise devices<!-- 8092655   -->

On Android Enterprise devices, you can create a device password profile that sets the **Required password type** (**Devices** > **Configuration** > **Create** > **Android Enterprise** for platform > **Fully Managed, Dedicated, and Corporate-Owned Work Profile** > **Device restrictions** > **Device password**).

The **Required password type** setting default is changing from **Numeric** to **Device default**.

Existing profiles aren't affected. New profiles will automatically use **Device default**.

Most devices don't require a password when **Device default** is selected. If you want to require your users to set up a passcode on their devices, configure the **Required password type** setting to something more secure than **Device default**.

To see the settings you can restrict, go to [Android Enterprise device settings to allow or restrict features](../configuration/device-restrictions-android-for-work.md).

Applies to:
- Android Enterprise

#### Configure the macOS Microsoft Enterprise SSO plug-in<!-- 5627576 8278906-->

> [!IMPORTANT]
> On macOS, the Microsoft Entra SSO extension is listed in the Intune user interface, but wasn't working as expected. This feature is now working, and is available to use in public preview.

The Microsoft Entra team created a redirect single sign-on (SSO) app extension. This app extension allows macOS 10.15+ users to access Microsoft apps, organization apps, and websites that support Apple's SSO feature. It authenticates using Microsoft Entra ID, with one sign-on.

With the Microsoft Enterprise SSO plug-in release, you can configure the SSO extension with the new Microsoft Entra app extension type in Intune (**Devices** > **Configuration** > **Create** > **macOS** for platform > **Device features** for profile >  **Single sign-on app extension** > SSO app extension type > **Microsoft Entra ID**).

To get SSO with the Microsoft Entra SSO app extension type, users need to install and sign in to the Company Portal app on their macOS devices.

For more information about macOS SSO app extensions, see [Single sign-on app extension](../configuration/device-features-configure.md#single-sign-on-sso).

Applies to:
- macOS 10.15 and newer

#### Changes for Password settings in Device restriction profiles for Android device administrator<!-- 7662279  -->

Recently we added *Password complexity* as a new setting for [Device compliance](../protect/compliance-policy-create-android.md#password) policy and [Device restriction](../configuration/device-restrictions-android.md#password)
for *Android device administrator*. We've now added more changes to the UI for settings in both policy types to help Intune accommodate the password changes in Android version 10 and later. These changes help ensure settings for passwords continue to apply to devices as expected.

You'll find the following changes to the Intune UI for passwords settings for the two policy types, which won't affect existing profiles:

- Settings are reorganized into sections that are based on which device versions the setting applies to, like Android 9 and earlier, or Android 10 and later.
- Updates to labels and example text in the UI.
- Clarifications for references to PINs as *numerical* or *alphabetical*, or *alphanumeric*.

Applies to:
- Android device administrator

#### New version of the PFX Certificate Connector<!-- 8476079 -->

We've released a new version of the PFX Certificate Connector, version **6.2008.60.612**. This new connector version:

- Fixes an issue with PKCS certificate delivery to Android Enterprise Fully Managed devices. The issue required the cryptography Key Storage Provider (KSP) be a legacy provider. You can now use a Cryptographic Next Generation (CNG) Key Storage Provider as well.
- Changes to *CA Account* tab of the PFX Certificate Connector: The Username and password (credentials) that you specify are now used to issue certificates and to revoke certificates. Previously these credentials were used only for certificate revocation.

For more information about certificate connectors, including a list of connector releases for both certificate connectors, see [Certificate connectors](../protect/certificate-connectors.md).

#### Intune Security tasks include details about misconfigured settings from Microsoft Defender for Endpoint TVM <!-- 5568193   -->

Microsoft Intune Security tasks now report on and provide remediation details for misconfigurations discovered by Threat Vulnerability Management (TVM). The misconfigurations that are reported to Intune are limited to issues for which remediation guidance can be provided.

TVM is part of Microsoft Defender for Endpoint. Prior to this update, details from TVM only included details and remediation steps for Applications.

When you view Security tasks, you'll find a new column named *Remediation Type* that identifies the type of issue:
- Application – Vulnerable applications and remediation steps. This issue type has been available in Security tasks prior to this update.
- Configuration – A new category of details from TVM that identify misconfiguration and provides steps to help you remediate them.

For more information on security tasks, see [Use Intune to remediate vulnerabilities identified by Microsoft Defender for Endpoint](../protect/atp-manage-vulnerabilities.md).

#### Endpoint security Firewall policies for tenant attached devices <!--  7323417   -->

As a public preview, you can deploy endpoint security [policy for Firewalls](../protect/endpoint-security-firewall-policy.md) to devices you manage with Configuration Manager. This scenario requires you to configure a tenant attach between a supported version of Configuration Manager and your Intune subscription.

Firewall policy for tenant attached devices is supported for devices that run *Windows 10 and later*, and requires your environment to run *Configuration Manager current branch 2006* with the in-console hotfix *KB4578605*.

For more information, see the [requirements for Intune endpoint security policies](../protect/tenant-attach-intune.md#configuration-manager-version-requirements-for-intune-endpoint-security-policies) to support Tenant Attach.

#### Expanded settings to manage hardware device installation through block and allowlist<!-- 7339038      -->

In **Device control** profiles, which are part of endpoint security [Attack surface reduction policy](../protect/endpoint-security-asr-policy.md), we've revised and [expanded our settings for managing hardware device installation](../protect/endpoint-security-asr-profile-settings.md#device-control). You'll now find settings to define *blocklists* and separate *allowlists* using *device IDs*, *setup classes*, and *instance identifiers*.  The following six settings are now available:

- Allow hardware device installation by device identifiers
- Block hardware device installation by device identifiers
- Allow hardware device installation by setup class
- Block hardware device installation by setup class
- Allow hardware device installation by device instance identifiers
- Block hardware device installation by device instance identifiers

Each of these settings supports the options of *Yes*, *No*, and *Not configured*.
When you configure *Yes*, you can then define the block or allowlist for that setting.
On a device, hardware that is specified in an allowlist can install or update. However, if that same hardware is specified on a blocklist, the block overrides the allowlist and installation or update of the hardware is prevented.

#### Improvements to endpoint security Firewall rules<!-- 7732448    -->

We've made several changes to improve the experience of configuring firewall rules in the [Microsoft Defender Firewall rules profile](../protect/endpoint-security-firewall-profile-settings.md) for endpoint security Firewall policy.

Improvements include:
- Improved layout in the UI, including section headers to organize the view.
- Increasing the character limit for the description field.
- Validation of IP address entries.
- Sorting of IP address lists.
- Option to *select all* addresses when you clear entries from an IP address list.

#### Per-account VPN connection for email profiles on iOS/iPadOS devices<!-- 7759116   -->

Starting with iOS/iPadOS 14, email traffic for the native Mail app can be routed through a VPN based on the account the user is using. In Intune, you can configure the **VPN profile for per account VPN** setting (**Devices** > **Configuration** > **Create** > **iOS/iPadOS** for platform > **Email** for profile > **Exchange ActiveSync email settings**).

This feature lets you select a per-app VPN profile to use for an account-based VPN connection. The per-app VPN connection automatically turns on when users use their organization account in the Mail app.

To see this setting and the others you can configure, go to [Add e-mail settings for iOS and iPadOS devices](../configuration/email-settings-ios.md).

Applies to:
- iOS/iPadOS 14 and newer

#### Disable MAC address randomization on Wi-Fi networks on iOS/iPadOS devices<!-- 7758689   -->

Starting with iOS/iPadOS 14, by default, devices present a randomized MAC address instead of the physical MAC address when connecting to a network. This behavior is recommended for privacy, as it's harder to track a device by its MAC address. This feature also breaks functionality that relies on a static MAC address, including network access control (NAC).

You can disable MAC address randomization on a per-network basis in Wi-Fi profiles (**Devices** > **Configuration** > **Create** > **iOS/iPadOS** for platform > **Wi-Fi** for profile > **Basic** or **Enterprise** for Wi-Fi type).

To see this setting, and the others you can configure, go to [Add Wi-Fi settings for iOS and iPadOS devices](../configuration/wi-fi-settings-ios.md).

Applies to:
- iOS/iPadOS 14 and newer

#### New settings for Device control profiles <!-- 8368028 -->

We've added a pair of settings to the [*Device control* profile](../protect/endpoint-security-asr-profile-settings.md#device-control-profile) for the *Attack surface reduction* policy for devices that run Windows 10 or later:

- **Removable storage**
- **USB connections (HoloLens only)**

*Attack surface reduction* policy is part of [Endpoint security](../protect/endpoint-security-policy.md) in Intune.

#### Rename a co-managed device that is Microsoft Entra joined<!--7728043  -->

You can now rename a co-managed device that is Microsoft Entra joined. For more information, see [Rename a device in Intune](../remote-actions/device-rename.md).

#### Tenant attach: Device timeline in the admin center<!--7220536, CM7141381-->

When Configuration Manager synchronizes a device to Microsoft Intune through tenant attach, you can see a timeline of events. This timeline shows past activity on the device that can help you troubleshoot problems. For more information, see [Tenant attach: Device timeline in the admin center](../../configmgr/tenant-attach/timeline.md).

#### <a name="bkmk_hinv"></a> Tenant attach: Resource explorer in the admin center<!--IN7220536, CM6479284 -->

From the Microsoft Intune admin center, you can view hardware inventory for uploaded Configuration Manager devices by using resource explorer. For more information, see [Tenant attach: Resource explorer in the admin center](../../configmgr/tenant-attach/resource-explorer.md).

#### Tenant attach: CMPivot from the admin center<!--IN7220536, CM6024392-->

Bring the power of CMPivot to the Microsoft Intune admin center. Allow other personas, like Helpdesk, to initiate real-time queries from the cloud against an individual ConfigMgr managed device and return the results back to the admin center. This feature gives the traditional benefits of CMPivot. It allows IT Admins and other designated personas the ability to quickly assess the state of devices in their environment and take action.

For more information about CMPivot from the admin center, see [CMPivot prerequisites](../../configmgr/tenant-attach/cmpivot-start.md), [CMPivot overview](../../configmgr/tenant-attach/cmpivot-overview-attached.md), and [CMPivot sample scripts](../../configmgr/tenant-attach/cmpivot-samples-attached.md).

Bring the power of the Configuration Manager on-premises [Run scripts](../../configmgr/apps/deploy-use/create-deploy-scripts.md) feature to the Microsoft Intune admin center. Allow other personas, like Helpdesk, to run PowerShell scripts from the cloud against an individual Configuration Manager managed device in real time. This feature gives all the traditional benefits of PowerShell scripts that are already defined and approved by the Configuration Manager admin to this new environment. For more information, see [Tenant attach: Run Scripts from the admin center](../../configmgr/tenant-attach/scripts.md).

#### Tamper Protection policy for Tenant Attached devices in preview<!-- 7303958  -->

In preview, we've added a new profile to Intune endpoint security Antivirus policy that you can use to [manage Tamper Protection on tenant attached devices](../protect/endpoint-security-antivirus-policy.md#devices-managed-by-configuration-manager): **Windows Security experience (preview)**.

The new profile is found under the *Windows 10 and Windows Server (ConfigMgr)* platform when you create a new Antivirus policy.

Before you can use Intune endpoint security policies with tenant attached devices, you need to configure Configuration Manager [tenant attach](../protect/tenant-attach-intune.md), and synchronize devices with Intune.

Also be aware of the specific [prerequisites](../protect/endpoint-security-antivirus-policy.md#prerequisites-for-tamper-protection) that are required to use and support tamper protection with Intune policy.

<!-- vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv -->
### Device security

#### Microsoft Tunnel Gateway VPN solution in preview<!-- 7843124  -->

You can now deploy [Microsoft Tunnel Gateway](../protect/microsoft-tunnel-overview.md) to provide remote access to on-premises resources on iOS and Android Enterprise (Fully managed, Corporate-Owned Work Profile, Work profile) devices.

Microsoft Tunnel supports per-app and full device VPN, split tunneling, and conditional access capabilities using modern authentication.  Tunnel can support multiple gateway servers for high availability for production readiness.

#### Biometric authentication support for Android devices<!-- 5706213  -->

New Android devices are making use of a more diverse set of biometrics beyond fingerprints. When OEMs implement support for non-fingerprint biometrics, end users have the potential to use this capability for secure access and a better experience. With the 2009 release of Intune, you can allow your end users to use fingerprint or Face Unlock, depending on what the Android device supports. You can configure whether all biometric types beyond fingerprint can be used to authenticate. For more information, see [App protection experience for Android devices](../apps/app-protection-policy.md#app-protection-experience-for-android-devices).

#### New details in the Endpoint security configuration for a device<!-- 7745029     -->

You can now view more details for devices as part of a devices *Endpoint security configuration*. When you drill in to view status details about policies you've deployed to devices, you'll now find the following setting:

- **UPN** (User Principal Name): The UPN identifies which endpoint security profile is assigned to a given user on the device. This information is useful to help differentiate between multiple users on a device and multiple entries of a profile or baseline that's assigned to the device.

For more information, see [Resolve conflicts for security baselines](../protect/security-baselines-monitor.md#resolve-conflicts-for-security-baselines).

#### Expanded RBAC permissions for the Endpoint Security role<!--7312374    -->

The **Endpoint Security Manager** role for Intune has more [role-based access control (RBAC) permissions for **remote tasks**](../protect/endpoint-security.md#permissions-granted-by-the-endpoint-security-manager-role).

This role grants access to the Microsoft Intune admin center. It can be used by individuals who manage security and compliance features, including security baselines, device compliance, conditional access, and Microsoft Defender for Endpoint.

New permissions for *remote tasks* include:

- Reboot now
- Remote lock
- Rotate BitLockerKeys (Preview)
- Rotate FileVault key
- Sync devices
- Microsoft Defender
- Initiate Configuration Manger action

To view the full set of permission for any Intune RBAC role, go to (**Tenant admin** > **Intune roles** > *select a role* > **Permissions**).

#### Updates for Security Baselines<!-- 7102146, 7103916     -->
We have new versions available for the following [security baselines](../protect/security-baselines.md):

- **[MDM Security baseline (Windows 10 Security)](../protect/security-baseline-settings-mdm-all.md?pivots-mdm-sept-2020)**
- **[Microsoft Defender for Endpoint baseline](../protect/security-baseline-settings-defender.md?pivots=atp-sept-2020)**

Updated baseline versions bring support for recent settings to help you maintain the best-practice configurations recommended by the respective product teams.

To understand what's changed between versions, see [Compare baseline versions](../protect/security-baselines.md) to learn how to export a .CSV file that shows the changes.

#### Use Endpoint security configuration details to identify the source of policy conflicts for devices<!-- 7567503    -->

To aid in conflict resolution, now you can drill in through a security baseline profile to view the *Endpoint security configuration* for a selected device. Then, you can select settings that show a *Conflict* or *Error*. Continue to drill in further to view a list of details that includes the profiles and policies that are part of the conflict.

If you then select a policy that is a source of a conflict, Intune opens that policies Overview pane where you can review or modify the policies configuration.

The following policy types can be identified as a source of conflict when you drill in through a security baseline:

- Device configuration policy
- Endpoint security policies

For more information, see [Resolve conflicts for security baselines](../protect/security-baselines-monitor.md#resolve-conflicts-for-security-baselines).

#### Support for certificates with a key size of 4096 on iOS and macOS devices<!-- 7659175   -->

When you configure a *SCEP certificate* profile for iOS/iPadOS or macOS devices, you can now specify a **Key size (bits)** of **4096** bits.

Intune supports 4096-bit keys for the following platforms:
- iOS 14 and later
- macOS 11 and later

To configure SCEP certificate profiles, see [Create a SCEP certificate profile](../protect/certificates-profile-scep.md#create-a-scep-certificate-profile).

#### Android 11 deprecates deployment of trusted root certificates to device administrator enrolled devices<!--7662775  -->

Beginning with Android 11, trusted root certificates can no longer install the trusted root certificate on devices that enroll as *Android device administrator*. This limitation doesn't affect Samsung Knox devices. For non-Samsung devices, users must manually install the trusted root certificate on the device.

After the trusted root certificate is manually installed on a device, you can use SCEP to provision certificates to the device. You must still create and deploy a *trusted certificate* policy to the device, and link that policy to the *SCEP certificate* profile.

- If the trusted root certificate is on the device, the SCEP certificate profile can install successfully.
- If the trusted certificate can't be found on the device, the SCEP certificate profile will fail.

For more information, see [Trusted certificate profiles for Android device administrator](../protect/certificates-trusted-root.md#trusted-certificate-profiles-for-android-device-administrator).


#### Tri-state options for more settings in Endpoint Security Firewall policy<!-- 6586159  -->

We've added a third state of configuration to a few more settings in [Endpoint security Firewall policies for Windows 10](../protect/endpoint-security-firewall-profile-settings.md).

The following settings are updated:
- **Stateful File Transfer Protocol (FTP)** now supports *Not configured*, *Allow*, and *Disabled*.
- **Require keying modules to only ignore the authentication suites they don't support** now supports *Not configured*, *Enabled*, and *Disabled*.

#### Improved certificate deployment for Android Enterprise <!-- 6296499     -->
We've improved our support for using [S/MIME certificates for Outlook](../protect/certificates-s-mime-encryption-sign.md) for encryption and signing on Android Enterprise devices that enroll as Fully Managed, Dedicated, and Corporate-Owned Work Profiles. Previously, use of S/MIME required the device user to allow access. Now, the S/MIME certificates can be used without user interaction.

To deploy S/MIME certificates to supported Android devices, use a [PKCS imported certificate profile](../protect/certificates-imported-pfx-configure.md) or [SCEP certificate profile](../protect/certificates-profile-scep.md) for Device configuration. Create a profile for **Android Enterprise** and then select **PKCS imported certificate** from the category for *Fully Managed, Dedicated, and Corporate-Owned Work Profile*.

#### Improved status details in security baseline reports<!-- 7221051 -->

We've begun improving many of the [status details for Security baseline](../protect/security-baselines-monitor.md). You'll now see more meaningful and detailed status when viewing information about the baseline Versions you've deployed.

Specifically, when you select a baseline, select *Version*, and the select an instance of that baseline, the initial Overview displays the following information:

- **Security baseline posture** chart - This chart now displays the following status details:
  - **Matches default baseline** – This status replaces *Matches baseline* and identifies when a devices configuration matches the default (unmodified) baseline configuration.
  - **Matches custom settings** – This status identifies when a devices configuration matches the baseline that you've configured (customized) and deployed.
  - **Misconfigured** – This status is a rollup that represents three status conditions from a device: *Error*, *Pending*, or *Conflict*. These separate states are available from other views, as detailed below.
  - **Not applicable** - This status represents a device that can't receive the policy. For example, the policy updates a setting specific to the latest version of Windows, but the device runs an older (earlier) version that doesn't support that setting.
- **Security baseline posture by category** - This view is a list view that displays device status by category. The available columns mirror much of the *Security baseline posture* chart, but in place of *Misconfigured*, you see three columns for the status that make up Misconfigured:
  - **Error**: The policy failed to apply. The message typically displays with an error code that links to an explanation.
  - **Conflict**: Two settings are applied to the same device, and Intune can't sort out the conflict. An administrator should review.
  - **Pending**: The device hasn't checked in with Intune to receive the policy yet.

#### New setting for Password complexity for Android 10 and later for device administrator enrolled devices<!-- 7992114 -->

To support new options for Android 10 and later on devices enrolled as Android device administrator, we've added a new setting called **Password complexity** to both [*Device compliance*](../protect/compliance-policy-create-android.md#password) policy and [*Device restriction*](../configuration/device-restrictions-android.md#password) policy.  You use this new setting to manage a *measure* of the password strength that factors in the password type, length, and quality.

Password Complexity doesn't apply to Samsung Knox devices. On these devices, password length and type settings override Password complexity.

Password complexity supports the following options:

- **None** - No password
- **Low** - The password satisfies one of the following:
  - Pattern
  - PIN with repeating (4444) or ordered (1234, 4321, 2468) sequences
- **Medium** - The password satisfies one of the following:
  - PIN with no repeating (4444) or ordered (1234, 4321, 2468) sequences, length at least 4
  - Alphabetic, length at least 4
  - Alphanumeric, length at least 4
- **High** - The Password satisfies one of the following:
  - PIN with no repeating (4444) or ordered (1234, 4321, 2468) sequences, length at least 8
  - Alphabetic, length at least 6
  - Alphanumeric, length at least 6

This new setting remains a work in progress. In late October 2020, Password complexity will take effect on devices.

If you set *Password complexity* to something other than *None*, then you must also configure another setting. The other settings ensure that end users who use a password that doesn't meet your complexity requirements receive a warning to update their password.

- Device compliance: Set **Require a password to unlock mobile devices** to **Require**.
- Device restriction: Set **Password** to **Require**

If you don't set the other setting to Require, users with weak passwords won't receive the warning.

### App management

#### Associated licenses revoked before deletion of Apple VPP token<!--6195322  -->

When you delete an Apple VPP token in Microsoft Intune, all Intune-assigned licenses associated with that token are automatically revoked before the deletion.

#### Improvement to Update device settings page in Company Portal app for Android to shows descriptions <!-- 7414768  -->

In the Company Portal app on Android devices, the **Update device settings** page lists the settings that need updated to be compliant. Users expand the issue to see more information, and see the **Resolve** button.

This user experience is improved. The listed settings are expanded by default to show the description, and show the **Resolve** button, when applicable. Previously, the issues were collapsed by default. This new default behavior reduces the number of clicks, so users can resolve issues more quickly.

#### The Company Portal adds Configuration Manager application support<!-- 4297660 -->

The Company Portal now supports Configuration Manager applications. This feature allows end users to see both Configuration Manager and Intune deployed applications in the Company Portal for co-managed customers. This new version of the Company Portal will display Configuration Manager deployed apps for all co-managed customers. This support will help administrators consolidate their different end-user portal experiences. For more information, see [Use the Company Portal app on co-managed devices](../../configmgr/comanage/company-portal.md).

### Device configuration

#### Use NetMotion as a VPN connection type for iOS/iPadOS and macOS devices<!-- 1333631   -->

When you create a VPN profile, NetMotion is available as a VPN connection type (**Devices** > **Configuration** > **Create** > **iOS/iPadOS** or **macOS** for platform > **VPN** for profile > **NetMotion** for connection type).

For more information on VPN profiles in Intune, see [Create VPN profiles to connect to VPN servers](../configuration/vpn-settings-configure.md).

Applies to:
- iOS/iPadOS
- macOS

#### More Protected Extensible Authentication Protocol (PEAP) options for Windows 10 Wi-Fi profiles<!-- 3805024  -->

On Windows 10 devices, you can create Wi-Fi profiles using the Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) to authenticate Wi-Fi connections (**Devices** > **Configuration** > **Create** > **Windows 10 and later** for platform > **Wi-Fi** for profile > **Enterprise**).

When you select Protected EAP (PEAP), there are new settings available:
- **Perform server validation in PEAP phase 1**: In PEAP negotiation phase 1, the server is verified by the certificate validation.
  - **Disable user prompts for server validation in PEAP phase 1**: In PEAP negotiation phase 1, user prompts asking to authorize new PEAP servers for trusted certification authorities aren't shown.
- **Require cryptographic binding**: Prevents connections to PEAP servers that don't use cryptobinding during the PEAP negotiation.

To see the settings you can configure, go to [Add Wi-Fi settings for Windows 10 and later devices](../configuration/wi-fi-settings-windows.md).

Applies to:
- Windows 10 and newer

#### Prevent users from unlocking Android Enterprise work profile devices using face and iris scanning<!--6069759 idmiss -->

You can now prevent users from using face or iris scanning to unlock their work profile-managed devices, either at the device level or the work profile level. This feature can be set in **Devices** > **Configuration** > **Create** > **Android Enterprise** for platform > **Work profile > Device restrictions** for profile > **Work profile settings** and **Password** sections.

For more information, see [Android Enterprise device settings to allow or restrict features on personally owned devices using Intune](../configuration/device-restrictions-android-enterprise-personal.md).

Applies to:

#### Use SSO app extensions on more iOS/iPadOS apps with the Microsoft Enterprise SSO plug-in<!-- 7369991  -->

The [Microsoft Enterprise SSO plug-in for Apple devices](/azure/active-directory/develop/apple-sso-plugin) can be used with all apps that support SSO app extensions. In Intune, this feature means the plug-in works with mobile iOS/iPadOS apps that don't use the Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL) for Apple devices. The apps don't need to use MSAL, but they do need to authenticate with Microsoft Entra endpoints.

To configure your iOS/iPadOS apps to use SSO with the plug-in, add the app bundle identifiers in an iOS/iPadOS configuration profile (**Devices** > **Configuration** > **Create** > **iOS/iPadOS** for platform > **Device features** for profile > **Single sign-on app extension** > **Microsoft Entra ID** for SSO app extension type > **App bundle IDs**).

To see the current SSO app extension settings you can configure, go to [Single sign-on app extension](../configuration/ios-device-features-settings.md#single-sign-on-app-extension).

Applies to:
- iOS/iPadOS

#### New version of the PFX Certificate Connector and changes for PKCS certificate profile support<!--  4839686  -->

We've released a new version of the PFX Certificate Connector, version **6.2008.60.607**. This new connector version:

- Supports PKCS certificate profiles on all supported platforms except Windows 8.1

  We've consolidated all of the PCKS support in the PFX Certificate Connector.  So if you don't use SCEP in your environment, and don't use NDES for other intents, then you can remove the Microsoft Certificate Connector and uninstall NDES from your environment.

- Because the Microsoft Certificate Connector hasn't had functionality removed, you can continue to use them to support PKCS certificate profiles.
- Supports certificate revocation for Outlook S/MIME
- Requires .NET Framework 4.7.2

For more information about certificate connectors, including a list of connector release for both certificate connectors, see [Certificate connectors](../protect/certificate-connectors.md)

<!-- vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv -->
### Device security

#### Deploy endpoint security Antivirus policy to tenant attached devices (preview)<!-- 5475441  -->

As a preview, you can deploy endpoint security [policy for Antivirus](../protect/endpoint-security-antivirus-policy.md) to devices you manage with Configuration Manager. This scenario requires you to configure a tenant attach between a supported version of Configuration Manager and your Intune subscription. The following versions of Configuration Manager are supported:

- Configuration Manager current branch 2006

For more information, see the [requirements for Intune endpoint security policies](../protect/tenant-attach-intune.md#
requirements-for-intune-endpoint-security-policies) to support Tenant Attach.

#### Changes for Endpoint security Antivirus policy exclusions<!--5583940, 6018119    -->

We've introduced two changes for managing the Microsoft Defender Antivirus exclusion lists you configure as part of an [Endpoint Security Antivirus policy](../protect/endpoint-security-antivirus-policy.md). The changes help you to prevent conflicts between different policies and resolve exclusion list conflicts that might exist in your previously deployed policies.

Both of the changes apply to policy settings for the following [Microsoft Defender Antivirus Configuration Service Providers](../protect/antivirus-microsoft-defender-settings-windows.md#microsoft-defender-antivirus-exclusions) (CSPs):

- Defender/ExcludedPaths
- Defender/ExcludedExtensions
- Defender/ExcludedProcesses

The changes are:

- New profile type: **Microsoft Defender Antivirus exclusions** - Use this new profile type for Windows 10 and later to define a policy that is focused only on Antivirus exclusions. This profile helps simplify management of your exclusion lists by separating them from other policy configurations.

  The exclusions you can configure include Defender *processes*, *file extensions*, and *files* and *folders* that you don't want Microsoft Defender to scan.

- **Policy merge** – Intune now merges the list of exclusions you've defined in separate profiles into a single list of exclusions to apply to each device or user. For example, if you target a user with three separate policies, the exclusion lists from those three policies merge into a single superset of *Microsoft Defender Antivirus exclusions*, that then apply to that user.

#### Import and export lists of address ranges for Windows Firewall rules<!-- 8125400  -->

We've added support to **Import** or **Export** a list of address ranges using .csv files to the Microsoft Defender Firewall rules profile in the Firewall policy for Endpoint security. The following Windows Firewall rule settings now support import and export:

- **Local address ranges**
- **Remote address ranges**

We've also improved validation of both local and remote address range entry to help prevent duplicate or invalid entries.

For more information about these settings, see the settings for [Microsoft Defender Firewall rules](../protect/endpoint-security-firewall-profile-settings.md).

#### Set device compliance state from third-party MDM providers<!-- 6361689 -->

Intune now supports [third-party MDM solutions as a source of device compliance details](../protect/device-compliance-partners.md). This third-party compliance data can be used to enforce Conditional Access policies for Microsoft 365 apps on iOS and Android through integration with Microsoft Intune.  Intune evaluates the compliance details from the third-party provider to determine if a device is trusted, and then sets the conditional access attributes in Microsoft Entra ID.  You'll continue to create your Microsoft Entra Conditional Access policies from within the Microsoft Intune admin center or the Microsoft Entra admin center.

The following third-party MDM providers are supported with this release, as a public preview:

- VMware Workspace ONE UEM (previously known as AirWatch)

*This update is rolling out to customers globally. You should see this capability within the next week.*

### App management

#### Update to device icons in Company Portal and Intune apps on Android<!-- 6057023 -->

We have updated the device icons in the Company Portal and Intune apps on Android devices to create a more modern look and feel and to align with the Microsoft Fluent Design System. For more information, see [Update to icons in Company Portal app for iOS/iPadOS and macOS](whats-new-app-ui.md#update-to-icons-in-company-portal-app-for-iosipados-and-macos-).

#### Exchange On-Premises Connector support<!-- 7138486  -->

Intune is removing support for the Exchange On-Premises Connector feature from the Intune service beginning in the 2007 (July) release. Existing customers with an active connector can continue with the current functionality at this time. New customers and existing customers that don't have an active connector will no longer be able to create new connectors or manage Exchange ActiveSync (EAS) devices from Intune. For those customers, Microsoft recommends the use of Exchange [hybrid modern authentication (HMA)](/office365/enterprise/hybrid-modern-auth-overview) to protect access to Exchange on-premises. HMA enables both Intune App Protection Policies (also known as MAM) and Conditional Access through Outlook Mobile for Exchange on-premises.

#### S/MIME for Outlook on iOS and Android devices without enrollment<!-- 6517155 -->

You can now enable S/MIME for Outlook on iOS and Android devices using an app configuration policy for managed apps. This feature allows for policy delivery regardless of device enrollment state. In [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431), select **Apps** > **App configuration policies** > **Add** > **Managed apps**. Also, you can choose whether or not to allow users to change this setting in Outlook. However, to automatically deploy S/MIME certificates to Outlook for iOS and Android, the device must be enrolled. For general information about S/MIME, see [S/MIME overview to sign and encrypt email in Intune](../protect/certificates-s-mime-encryption-sign.md). For more information about Outlook configuration settings, see [Microsoft Outlook configuration settings](../apps/app-configuration-policies-outlook.md) and [Add app configuration policies for managed apps without device enrollment](../apps/app-configuration-policies-managed-app.md). For Outlook for iOS and Android S/MIME information, see [S/MIME scenarios](/exchange/clients-and-mobile-in-exchange-online/outlook-for-ios-and-android/outlook-for-ios-and-android-configuration-with-microsoft-intune#smime-scenarios) and [Configuration keys - S/MIME settings](/exchange/clients-and-mobile-in-exchange-online/outlook-for-ios-and-android/outlook-for-ios-and-android-configuration-with-microsoft-intune#smime-settings).

### Device enrollment

#### iOS Company Portal will support Apple's Automated Device Enrollment without user affinity<!-- 7282707 -->

The iOS Company Portal is now supported on devices enrolled using Apple's Automated Device Enrollment without requiring an assigned user. An end user can sign in to the iOS Company Portal to establish themselves as the primary user on an iOS/iPadOS device enrolled without device affinity. For more information about Automated Device Enrollment, see [Automatically enroll iOS/iPadOS devices with Apple's Automated Device Enrollment](../enrollment/device-enrollment-program-enroll-ios.md).

#### Corporate-owned, personally enabled devices (preview)<!--4442275  -->

Intune now supports Android Enterprise corporate-owned devices with a work profile for OS versions Android 8 and later. Corporate-owned devices with a work profile are one of the corporate management scenarios in the Android Enterprise solution set. This scenario is for single user devices intended for corporate and personal use. This corporate-owned, personally enabled (COPE) scenario offers:

- work and personal profile containerization
- device-level control for admins
- a guarantee for end users that their personal data and applications will remain private

The first public preview release will include a subset of the features that will be included in the generally available release. More features will be added on a rolling basis. The features that will be available in the first preview include:

- Enrollment: Admins can create multiple enrollment profiles with unique tokens that don't expire. Device enrollment can be done through NFC, token entry, QR code, Zero Touch, or Knox Mobile Enrollment.
- Device configuration: A subset of the existing fully managed and dedicated device settings.
- Device compliance: The compliance policies that are currently available for fully managed devices.
- Device Actions: Delete device (factory reset), reboot device, and lock device.
- App management: App assignments, app configuration, and the associated reporting capabilities
- Conditional Access

For more information about corporate-owned with work profile preview, see the [support blog](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/intune-customer-success/microsoft-announces-public-preview-for-android-enterprise/ba-p/1524325).

### Device management

#### Tenant attach: ConfigMgr client details in the admin center (preview)<!-- 7552762 -->

You can now see ConfigMgr client details including collections, boundary group membership, and real-time client information for a specific device in the Microsoft Intune admin center. For more information, see [Tenant attach: ConfigMgr client details in the admin center (preview)](../../configmgr/tenant-attach/client-details.md).

#### Updates to the remote lock action for macOS devices<!--7032805   -->

Changes to the remote lock action for macOS devices include:
- The recovery pin is displayed for 30 days before deletion (instead of seven days).
- If an admin has a second browser open and tries to trigger the command again from a different tab or browser, Intune lets the command go through. But the reporting status is set to failed rather than generating a new pin.
- The admin isn't allowed to issue another remote lock command if the previous command is still pending or if the device hasn't checked back in.
These changes are designed to prevent the correct pin from being overwritten after multiple remote lock commands.

#### Device actions report differentiates between wipe and protected wipe<!--7118901 -->

The **Device actions** report now differentiates between the wipe and protected wipe actions. To see the report, go to [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431) > **Devices** > **Monitor** > **Device Actions** (under **Other**).

<!-- vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv -->
### Device security

#### Microsoft Defender Firewall rule migration tool preview<!-- 6423187   -->

As a public preview, we're working on a PowerShell based tool that will migrate Microsoft Defender Firewall rules. When you install and run the tool, it automatically creates endpoint security firewall rule policies for Intune. The rules are based on the current configuration of a Windows 10 client. For more information, see [Endpoint security firewall rule migration tool overview](../protect/endpoint-security-firewall-rule-tool.md).

#### Endpoint detection and response policy for onboarding Tenant Attached devices to Microsoft Defender for Endpoint is Generally Available<!-- 7303816   -->

As part of endpoint security in Intune, the [Endpoint detection and response (EDR) policies for use with devices managed by Configuration Manager](../protect/endpoint-security-edr-policy.md) are *Generally Available*.

To use EDR policy with devices from a supported version of Configuration Manager, configure [Tenant attach for Configuration Manager](../../configmgr/tenant-attach/device-sync-actions.md). After you complete the tenant attach configuration, you can deploy EDR policies to onboard devices managed by Configuration Manager to Microsoft Defender for Endpoint.

#### Bluetooth settings are available in Device Control profiles for Endpoint security Attack surface reduction policy <!--7032084   -->

We've added settings to manage Bluetooth on Windows 10 devices to the [Device control profile](../protect/endpoint-security-asr-profile-settings.md#device-control-profile) for *Endpoint security Attack surface Reduction policy*.  These settings are the same settings that have been available in Device restriction profiles for *Device configuration*.

#### Manage source locations for definition updates with endpoint security antivirus policy for Windows 10 devices<!-- 6347801   -->

There are new settings to the *Updates* category of [endpoint security antivirus policy for Windows 10 devices](../protect/antivirus-microsoft-defender-settings-windows.md#updates). These settings can help you manage how devices get update definitions:

- *Define file shares for downloading definition updates*
- *Define the order of sources for downloading definition updates*

With the new settings, you can add UNC file shares as download source locations for definition updates, and define the order in which different source locations are contacted.

#### Improved security baselines node<!-- 7433136    -->

We've made some changes to improve the usability of the [security baseline node](../protect/security-baselines.md) in the Microsoft Intune admin center. Now when you drill in to **Endpoint security** > **Security baselines** and then select a security baseline type like the MDM Security Baseline, you're presented with the **Profiles** pane. On the Profiles pane, you view the profiles you've created for that Baseline type.  Previously the console presented an Overview pane, which included an aggregate data roll up that didn't always match the details found in the reports for individual profiles.

Unchanged, from the Profiles pane you can select a profile to drill in to view that profiles properties and various reports that are available under *Monitor*.  Similarly, at the same level as Profiles you can still select **Versions** to view the various versions of that profile type that you've deployed. When you drill in to a version, you also gain access to reports, similar to the profile reports.

#### Derived credentials support for Windows<!-- 4886090   -->

You can now use derived credentials with your Windows devices. This feature expands existing support for iOS/iPadOS and Android, and will be available for the same derived credential providers:
- Entrust
- Intercede
- DISA Purebred

Support for Widows includes use of a derived credential to authenticate to Wi-Fi or VPN profiles. For Windows devices, the derived credential is issued from the client app that's provided by the derived credential provider that you use.

#### Manage FileVault encryption for devices that were encrypted by the device user and not by Intune<!--5239424  -->

Intune can now [assume management of FileVault disk encryption on a macOS device that was encrypted by the device user](../protect/encrypt-devices-filevault.md#assume-management-of-filevault-on-previously-encrypted-devices), and not by Intune policy.  This scenario requires:
- The device to receive disk encryption policy from Intune that enables FileVault.
- The device user to use the Company Portal website to upload their personal recovery key for the encrypted device to Intune. To upload the key, they select the *Store recovery key* option for their encrypted macOS device.

After the user uploads their recovery key, Intune rotates the key to confirm the key is valid. Intune can now manage the key and encryption as if it used policy to encrypt the device directly. Should a user need to recover their device, they can access the recovery key using any device from the following locations:
- Company Portal website
- Company Portal app for iOS/iPadOS
- Company Portal app for Android
- Intune app

#### Hide the personal recovery key from a device user during macOS FileVault disk encryption<!--  5475632-->

When you use endpoint security policy to configure macOS FileVault disk encryption, use the [**Hide recovery key**](../protect/endpoint-security-disk-encryption-profile-settings.md#filevault) setting to prevent display of the *personal recovery key* to the device user, while the device is being encrypted. By hiding the key during encryption, you can help keep it secure as users won't be able to write it down while waiting for the device to encrypt.

Later, if recovery is needed, a user can use any device to view their personal recovery key through the options:

- Intune Company Portal website
- The iOS/iPadOS Company Portal app
- The Android Company Portal app
- The Intune app

#### Improved view of security baseline details for devices<!-- 5536846  -->

Now you can drill in to the details for a device to view the settings details for security baselines that apply to the device. The settings appear in a simple, flat list, which includes the setting category, setting name, and status. For more information, see [View Endpoint security configurations per device](../protect/security-baselines-monitor.md).

### Monitor and troubleshoot

#### Device compliance logs now in English<!--6014904  -->

The Intune DeviceComplianceOrg logs previously only had enumerations for ComplianceState, OwnerType, and DeviceHealthThreatLevel. Now, these logs have English information in the columns.

#### Power BI compliance report template V2.0<!-- 636958 -->

Power BI template apps enable Power BI partners to build Power BI apps with little or no coding, and deploy them to any Power BI customer. Admins can update the version of the Power BI compliance report template from V1.0 to V2.0. V2.0 includes an improved design, and changes to the calculations and data that are surfaced as part of the template. For more information, see [Connect to the Data Warehouse with Power BI](../developer/reports-proc-get-a-link-powerbi.md) and [Update a template app](/power-bi/service-template-apps-install-distribute#update-a-template-app).

In addition to creating a more modern look and feel, we reorganized the device details under a single column with defined section headers so that it's easier for users to see their device status. We also added clearer messaging and  troubleshooting steps for users whose devices fall out of compliance. For more information about Company Portal, see [How to customize the Intune Company Portal apps, Company Portal website, and Intune app](../apps/company-portal-app.md). To manually sync a device, see [Sync your iOS device manually](../user-help/sync-your-device-manually-ios.md).

#### Cloud setting for iOS/iPadOS Company Portal app<!-- 7071303  -->

A new **Cloud** setting for the iOS/iPadOS Company Portal allows users to redirect their authentication towards the appropriate cloud for your organization. By default, the setting is configured to **Automatic**, which directs authentication towards the cloud automatically detected by the user's device. If authentication for your organization must be redirected towards a cloud other than the cloud that is automatically detected (such as Public or Government), your users can manually select the appropriate cloud by selecting the **Settings** app > **Company Portal** > **Cloud**. Your users should only change the **Cloud** setting from **Automatic** if they sign in from another device and the appropriate cloud isn't automatically detected by their device.

#### Duplicate Apple VPP tokens<!-- 7101606  -->

Apple VPP tokens with the same **Token Location** are now marked as **Duplicate** and can be synced again when the duplicate token has been removed. You can still assign and revoke licenses for tokens that are marked as duplicate. However, licenses for new apps and books purchased might not be reflected once a token is marked as duplicate. To find Apple VPP tokens for your tenant, from [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431), select **Tenant administration** > **Connectors and tokens** > **Apple VPP Tokens**.

- A count of removed Apple Business Manager devices will be added to the overview page where you see the status of your devices.

#### Shared iPads for Business<!--6367326   -->

You can use Intune and Apple Business Manager to easily and securely set up Shared iPad so that multiple employees can share devices. Apple's [Shared iPad](https://developer.apple.com/education/shared-ipad/) provides a personalized experience for multiple users while preserving user data. Using a Managed Apple ID, users can access their apps, data, and settings after signing into any Shared iPad in their organization. Shared iPad works with federated identities.

To see this feature, go to [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431) > **Devices** > **iOS** > **iOS enrollment** > **Enrollment program tokens** > **choose a token** > **Profiles** > **Create profile** > **iOS**. On the **Management Settings** page, select **Enroll without User Affinity** and you see the **Shared iPad** option.

Requires: iPadOS 13.4 and later. This release added support for temporary sessions with Shared iPad so that users can access a device without a Managed Apple ID. Upon sign out, the device erases all user data so that the device is immediately ready for use, eliminating the need for a device wipe.

#### Updated user interface for Apple's Automated Device Enrollment<!--7430322 -->

The user interface has been updated to replace Apple's Device Enrollment Program to Automated Device Enrollment to reflect Apple terminology.

### Device management

#### Device remote lock pin available for macOS<!--7281557   -->

The availability for macOS device remote lock pins has been increased from 7 days to 30 days.

#### Change primary user on co-managed devices<!--7319183  -->

You can change a device's primary user for co-managed Windows devices. For more information on how to find and change it, see [Find the primary user of an Intune device](../remote-actions/find-primary-user.md). This feature will be rolling out gradually over the next few weeks.

<a name='setting-the-intune-primary-user-also-sets-the-azure-ad-owner-property--7319227---'></a>

#### Setting the Intune primary user also sets the Microsoft Entra owner property<!--7319227 -->

This new feature automatically sets the owner property on newly enrolled Microsoft Entra hybrid joined devices at the same time that the Intune primary user is set. For more information on the primary user, see [Find the primary user of an Intune device](../remote-actions/find-primary-user.md).

This behavior is a change to the enrollment process and only applies to newly enrolled devices. For existing Microsoft Entra hybrid joined devices, you must manually update the Microsoft Entra Owner property. To update, you can use the [Change primary user feature](../remote-actions/find-primary-user.md#change-a-devices-primary-user) or [a script](https://github.com/microsoftgraph/powershell-intune-samples/tree/master/ManagedDevices).

When Windows 10 devices become Microsoft Entra hybrid joined, the first user of the device becomes the primary user in Intune.  Currently, the user isn't set on the corresponding Microsoft Entra device object. This behavior causes an inconsistency when comparing the *owner* property from a Microsoft Entra admin center with the *primary user* property in Microsoft Intune admin center. The Microsoft Entra owner property is used for securing access to BitLocker recovery keys. The property isn't populated on Microsoft Entra hybrid joined devices. This limitation prevents setup of self-service of BitLocker recovery from Microsoft Entra ID. This upcoming feature solves this limitation.

<!-- vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv -->
### Device security

#### Hide the recovery key from users during FileVault 2 encryption for macOS devices<!-- 5459801  -->

We've added a new setting to the *FileVault* category within the [macOS Endpoint Protection](../protect/endpoint-protection-macos.md#filevault) template: **Hide recovery key**. This setting hides the personal key from the end user during FileVault 2 encryption.

To view the personal recovery key of an encrypted macOS device, the device user can go to any of the following locations and select *get recovery key* for the macOS device:

- The iOS/iPadOS company portal app
- The Intune app
- The company portal website
- The Android company portal app

#### Support for S/MIME signing and encryption certificates with Outlook on Android Fully Managed<!--5896415   -->

You can now use certificates for S/MIME signing and encryption with Outlook on devices that run Android Enterprise Fully Managed.

This feature expands on the support added last month for other Android versions (Support for S/MIME signing and encryption certificates with Outlook on Android). You can provision these certificates by using SCEP and PKCS imported certificate profiles.

For more information about this support, see [Sensitivity labeling and protection in Outlook for iOS and Android](/exchange/clients-and-mobile-in-exchange-online/outlook-for-ios-and-android/sensitive-labeling-and-protection-outlook-for-ios-android) in the Exchange documentation.

#### Add a link to your company portal support website to emails for noncompliance<!-- 7225498    -->

When you [configure a notification message template](../protect/actions-for-noncompliance.md#create-a-notification-message-template) for sending email notifications for noncompliance, use the new setting **Company Portal Website Link** to automatically include a link to your Company Portal website. When set to *Enable*, users with noncompliant devices who receive email based on this template can use the link to open a website to learn more about why their device isn't compliant.

#### Use Microsoft Defender for Endpoint in compliance policies for Android<!-- 4425686  -->

You can now use Intune to [onboard Android devices to Microsoft for Endpoint](../protect/advanced-threat-protection-configure.md#onboard-devices). After your enrolled devices are onboarded, your compliance policies for Android can use the *threat level* signals from Microsoft Defender for Endpoint. These signals are the same signals that you could previously use for Windows 10 devices.

#### Configure Defender for Endpoint web protection for Android devices<!-- 6185563  -->

When you use Microsoft Defender for Endpoint for Android devices, you can [configure Microsoft Defender for Endpoint web protection](../protect/advanced-threat-protection-manage-android.md) to disable the phishing scan feature, or prevent the scan from using VPN.

Depending on how your Android device enrolls with Intune, the following options are available:

- Android device administrator - Use custom OMA-URI settings to disable the web protection feature, or disable only the use of VPNs during scans.
- Android Enterprise work profile - Use an app configuration profile and the configuration designer to disable all web protection capabilities.

<!-- vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv -->
### Licensing

#### Admins no longer require an Intune license to access Microsoft Intune admin center<!--1335430 -->

You can now set a tenant-wide toggle that removes the Intune license requirement for admins to access the Intune admin center and query graph APIs. Once you remove the license requirement, you can never reinstate it.

> [!Note]
> Some actions, including the Teamviewer Connector flow, still require an Intune license to complete.

<!-- vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv -->
### Monitor and troubleshoot

#### Use Endpoint analytics to improve user productivity and reduce IT support costs<!-- 5653063 -->

During the next week, this feature will be rolled out. Endpoint analytics aims to improve user productivity and reduce IT support costs by providing insights into the user experience. The insights enable IT to optimize the end-user experience with proactive support and to detect regressions to the user experience by assessing user impact of configuration changes. For more information, see [Endpoint analytics preview](../../analytics/overview.md).

#### Proactively remediate end user device issues using script packages<!-- 5933328 -->

You can create and run script packages on end user devices to proactively find and fix the top support issues in your organization. Deploying script packages will help you reduce support calls. Choose to create your own script packages or deploy one of the script packages we've written and used in our environment to reduce support tickets. Intune allows you to see the status of your deployed script packages and to monitor the detection and remediation results. In [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431), select **Reports** > **Endpoint analytics** > **Proactive remediations**. For more information, see [Proactive remediations](../../analytics/remediations.md).

#### Auto update VPP available apps<!-- 3640511  -->
Apps that are published as Volume Purchase Program (VPP) available apps will be automatically updated when **Automatic App Updates** is enabled for the VPP token. Previously, VPP available apps did not automatically update. Instead, end-users had to go to the Company Portal and reinstall the app if a newer version was available. Required apps continue to support automatic updates.

#### Android Company Portal user experience<!-- 5736084  -->
In the 2005 release of Android Company Portal, end-users of Android devices that are issued a warning, block, or wipe by an app protection policy will see a new user experience. Instead of the current dialog experience, end-users will see a full page message describing the reason for the warn, block, or wipe and the steps to remediate the issue. For more information, see [App protection experience for Android devices](../apps/app-protection-policy.md#app-protection-experience-for-android-devices) and [Android app protection policy settings in Microsoft Intune](../apps/app-protection-policy-settings-android.md).

#### Support for multiple accounts in Company Portal for macOS<!-- 5779449  -->
The Company Portal on macOS devices now caches user accounts, making sign-in easier. Users no longer need to sign into the Company Portal every time they launch the application. Also, the Company Portal will display an account picker if multiple user accounts are cached, so that users don't have to enter their user name.

For more information, see [Deploy multiple OEMConfig profiles to Zebra devices in Microsoft Intune](../configuration/oemconfig-zebra-android-devices.md).

There is no change in OEMConfig behavior for other OEMs.

Applies to:
- Android Enterprise
- Zebra Technologies devices that support OEMConfig. For specific details on support, contact Zebra.

#### Configure system extensions on macOS devices<!-- 6255624 -->
On macOS devices, you can create a kernel extensions profile to configure settings at the kernel-level (**Devices** > **Configuration** > **macOS** for platform > **Kernel extensions** for profile). Apple is eventually deprecating kernel extensions, and replacing them with system extensions in a future release.

System extensions run in the user space, and don't have access to the kernel. The goal is to increase security and provide more end user control, while limiting attacks at the kernel level. Both kernel extensions and system extensions allow users to install app extensions that extend the native capabilities of the operating system.

In Intune, you can configure both kernel extensions and system extensions (**Devices** > **Configuration** > **macOS** for platform > **System extensions** for profile). Kernel extensions apply to 10.13.2 and newer. System extensions apply to 10.15 and newer. From macOS 10.15 to macOS 10.15.4, kernel extensions and system extensions can run side-by-side. 

To learn about these extensions on macOS devices, see [Add macOS extensions](../configuration/kernel-extensions-overview-macos.md).

Applies to:
- macOS 10.15 and newer

#### Configure app and process privacy preferences on macOS devices<!-- 2934232   --> 
With the release of macOS Catalina 10.15, Apple added new security and privacy enhancements. By default, applications and processes are unable to access specific data without user consent. If users don't provide consent, the applications and processes might fail to function. Intune is adding support for settings that enable IT administrators to allow or disallow data access consent on behalf of end-users on devices running macOS 10.14 and later. These settings will ensure that applications and processes continue to function properly, and reduce the number of prompts. 

For more information on the settings you can manage, see [macOS privacy preferences](../configuration/device-restrictions-macos.md#privacy-preferences).

Applies to:
- macOS 10.14 and newer

You can now use *DISA Purebred* as a [derived credentials](../protect/derived-credentials.md) provider on Android Enterprise fully managed devices. Support includes retrieving a derived credential for DISA Purebred. You can use a derived credential for app authentication, Wi-Fi, VPN, or S/MIME signing and/or encryption with apps that support it. 

#### Send push notifications as an action for noncompliance <!-- 1733150   -->
You can now configure an [action for noncompliance](../protect/actions-for-noncompliance.md#available-actions-for-noncompliance) that sends a push notification to a user when their device fails to meet conditions of a compliance policy. The new action is **Send push notification to end user**, and supports Android and iOS devices.

When users select the push notification on their device, the Company Portal or Intune app opens to display details about why they are noncompliant.

#### Endpoint security content and new features<!-- 5720009 5892558, 7130145, 5653324, 7140602  -->

The documentation for Intune [Endpoint Security](../protect/endpoint-security.md) is now available. In the endpoint security node of the Microsoft Intune admin center, you can:

- Create and deploy focused security policies to your managed devices
- Configure integration with Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, and manage security tasks help remediate risks for at-risk devices as identified by your Defender for Endpoint team
- Configure security baselines
- Manage device compliance and conditional access policies
- View compliance status for all your devices from both Intune and Configuration Manager when Configuration Manager is configured for client attach.

In addition to the availability of content, the following are new for Endpoint Security this month:

- [**Endpoint security policies**](../protect/endpoint-security-policy.md) **are out of** ***preview*** and are now ready to use in production environments, as *generally available*, with two exceptions:

  - In a new *public preview*, you can use the [**Microsoft Defender Firewall rules** profile](../protect/endpoint-security-firewall-policy.md#firewall-profiles) for Windows 10 Firewall policy. With each instance of this profile, you can configure up to 150 firewall rules to complement your Microsoft Defender Firewall profiles. 
  - Account protection security policy remains in preview. 

- You can now [**create a duplicate of endpoint security policies**](../protect/endpoint-security-policy.md#duplicate-a-policy). Duplicates keep the settings configuration of the original policy, but get a new name. Then new policy instance doesn't include any assignments to groups until you edit the new policy instance to add them. You can duplicate the following policies:
  - Antivirus
  - Disk encryption
  - Firewall
  - Endpoint detection and response
  - Attack surface reduction
  - Account protection

- You can now [**create a duplicate of a security baseline**](../protect/security-baselines-configure.md#duplicate-a-security-baseline). Duplicates keep the settings configuration of the original baseline, but get a new name. The new baseline instance doesn't include any assignments to groups until you edit the new baseline instance to add them.

- A new report for endpoint security antivirus policy is available: [**Windows 10 unhealthy endpoints**](../protect/endpoint-security-antivirus-policy.md#unhealthy-endpoints). This report is a new page you can select when your viewing your endpoint security antivirus policy. The report displays the antivirus status of your MDM-managed Windows 10 devices.  

#### Support for S/MIME signing and encryption certificates with Outlook on Android<!-- 7207474  -->

- Android Enterprise Work Profile
- Android Device Administrator

Support for Android Enterprise Fully Managed devices is coming soon.

For more information about this support, see [Sensitivity labeling and protection in Outlook for iOS and Android](/exchange/clients-and-mobile-in-exchange-online/outlook-for-ios-and-android/sensitive-labeling-and-protection-outlook-for-ios-android) in the Exchange documentation.

#### Use Endpoint detection and response policy to onboard devices to Defender for Endpoint<!-- 7130165  -->

Use endpoint security [policy for Endpoint detection and response](../protect/endpoint-security-edr-policy.md) (EDR) to onboard and configure devices for your deployment of Microsoft Defender for Endpoint. EDR supports policy for Windows devices managed by Intune (MDM), and a separate policy for Windows devices managed by Configuration Manager. 

To use the policy for Configuration Manager devices, you must [set up Configuration Manager to support the EDR policy](../protect/tenant-attach-intune.md). Set up includes:

- Configure your Configuration manager for *tenant attach*.
- Install an in-console update for Configuration Manager to enable support for the EDR policies. This update applies only to hierarchies that have enabled *tenant attach*.
- Synchronize your device collections from your hierarchy to the Microsoft Intune admin center.

Users who are assigned Microsoft 365 for macOS in Microsoft Intune will now receive Microsoft Teams in addition to the existing Microsoft 365 apps (Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, and OneNote). Intune will recognize the existing Mac devices that have the other Office for macOS apps installed. Then, it will attempt to install Microsoft Teams the next time the device checks in with Intune. In the [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431), you can find the **Office 365 Suite** for macOS by selecting **Apps** > **macOS** > **Add**. For more information, see [Assign Office 365 to macOS devices with Microsoft Intune](../apps/apps-add-office365-macos.md).

#### Update to Android app configuration policies<!-- 6113334  -->
Android app configuration policies have been updated to allow admins to select the device enrollment type before creating an app config profile. The functionality is being added to account for certificate profiles that are based on enrollment type (Work profile or Device Owner).

With this update:

1. If a new profile is created and Work Profile and Device Owner Profile are selected for device enrollment type, then you can't associate a certificate profile with the app config policy.
2. If a new profile is created and Work Profile only is selected, then Work Profile certificate policies created under Device Configuration can be utilized.
3. If a new profile is created and Device Owner only is selected, then Device Owner certificate policies created under Device Configuration can be utilized. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Existing policies created prior to the release of this feature (April 2020 release - 2004) that don't have any certificate profiles associated with the policy will default to Work Profile and Device Owner Profile for device enrollment type. Also, existing policies created prior to the release of this feature that have certificate profiles associated with them will default to Work Profile only.

Also, we are adding Gmail and Nine email configuration profiles that will work for both Work Profile and Device Owner enrollment types, including the use of certificate profiles on both email configuration types.  Any Gmail or Nine policies that you have created under Device Configuration for Work Profiles will continue to apply to the device. You don't to move them to app configuration policies.

In the [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431), you can find app configuration policies by selecting **Apps** > **App configuration policies**. For more information about app configuration policies, see [App configuration policies for Microsoft Intune](../apps/app-configuration-policies-overview.md).

#### Push notification when device ownership type is changed<!-- 5575875 -->
You can configure a push notification to send to both your Android and iOS Company Portal users when their device ownership type has been changed from Personal to Corporate as a privacy courtesy. This push notification is set to off by default. The setting can be found in the Microsoft Intune admin center by selecting **Tenant administration** > **Customization**. To learn more about how device ownership affects your end-users, see [Change device ownership](../enrollment/corporate-identifiers-add.md#change-device-ownership).

#### Group targeting support for Customization pane<!-- 4722837  -->
You can target the settings in the **Customization** pane to user groups. To find these settings in Intune, navigate to the [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431), select **Tenant administration** > **Customization**. For more information about customization, see [How to customize the Intune Company Portal apps, Company Portal website, and Intune app](../apps/company-portal-app.md).

### Device configuration

#### Multiple "Evaluate each connection attempt" on-demand VPN rules supported on iOS, iPadOS, and macOS<!-- 6424615  -->
The Intune user experience allows multiple on-demand VPN rules in the same VPN profile with the **Evaluate each connection attempt** action (**Devices** > **Configuration** > **Create** > **iOS/iPadOS** or **macOS** for platform > **VPN** for profile > **Automatic VPN** > **On-demand**).

It only honored the first rule in the list. This behavior is fixed, and Intune evaluates all rules in the list. Each rule is evaluated in the order it appears in the on-demand rules list.

> [!NOTE]
> If you have existing VPN profiles that use these on-demand VPN rules, the fix applies the next time you change the VPN profile. For example, make a minor change, such as change the connection the name, and then save the profile.
>
> If you're using SCEP certificates for authentication, this change causes the certificates for this VPN profile to be re-issued.

Applies to:
- iOS/iPadOS
- macOS

For more information on VPN profiles, see [Create VPN profiles](../configuration/vpn-settings-configure.md).

#### More options in SSO and SSO app extension profiles on iOS/iPadOS devices<!-- 6504155   -->

On iOS/iPadOS devices, you can:
- In SSO profiles (**Devices** > **Configuration** > **Create** > **iOS/iPadOS** for platform > **Device features** for profile > **Single sign-on**), set the Kerberos principal name to be the Security Account Manager (SAM) account name in SSO profiles. 
- In SSO app extension profiles (**Devices** > **Configuration** > **Create** > **iOS/iPadOS** for platform > **Device features** for profile > **Single sign-on app extension**), configure the iOS/iPadOS Microsoft Entra extension with fewer clicks by using a new SSO app extension type. You can enable the Microsoft Entra extension for devices in shared device mode and send extension-specific data to the extension.

Applies to:

### Device enrollment

#### Delete Apple Automated Device Enrollment token when default profile is present<!--6393220 -->
Previously, you couldn't delete a default profile, which meant that you couldn't delete the Automated Device Enrollment token associated with it. Now, you can delete the token when:
- no devices are assigned to the token
- a default profile is present
To do so, delete the default profile, and then delete the associated token.
For more information, see [Delete an ADE token from Intune](../enrollment/device-enrollment-program-enroll-ios.md#delete-an-automated-device-enrollment-token-from-intune).

#### Scaled up support for Apple Automated Device Enrollment and Apple Configurator 2 devices, profiles, and tokens<!--3542402 -->
To help distributed IT departments and organizations, Intune now supports up to 1000 enrollment profiles per token, 2000 Automated Device Enrollment (formerly known as DEP) tokens per Intune account, and 75,000 devices per token. There is no specific limit for devices per enrollment profile, below the maximum number of devices per token.

Intune now supports up to 1000 Apple Configurator 2 profiles.

For more information, see [Limits](../enrollment/device-enrollment-program-enroll-ios.md#limits).

#### All devices page column entry changes<!--6967616 -->
On the **All devices** page, the entries for the **Managed by** column have changed:
- *Intune* is now displayed instead of *MDM*
- *Co-managed* is now displayed instead of *MDM/ConfigMgr Agent*

The export values are unchanged.

<!-- vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv -->
### Device management

#### Trusted Platform Manager (TPM) Version information now on Device Hardware page<!--6224914 idmiss -->

You can now collect logs for improved troubleshooting of scripts assigned to macOS devices. You can collect logs up to 60 MB (compressed) or 25 files, whichever occurs first. For more information, see [Troubleshoot macOS shell script policies using log collection](../apps/macos-shell-scripts.md#troubleshoot-macos-shell-script-policies-using-log-collection).
 
<!-- vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv -->
### Security

#### Derived credentials to provision Android Enterprise Fully Managed devices with certificates<!--4839592    -->
Intune now supports use of [derived credentials](../protect/derived-credentials.md) as an authentication method for Android devices. Derived credentials are an implementation of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) 800-157 standard for deploying certificates to devices. Our support for Android expands on our support for devices that run iOS/iPadOS.

Derived credentials rely on the use of a Personal Identity Verification (PIV) or Common Access Card (CAC) card, like a smart card. To get a derived credential for their mobile device, users start in the Microsoft Intune app and follow an enrollment workflow that is unique to the provider you use. Common to all providers is the requirement to use a smart card on a computer to authenticate to the derived credential provider. That provider then issues a certificate to the device that's derived from the user's smart card.

You can use derived credentials as the authentication method for device configuration profiles for VPN and WiFi. You can also use them for app authentication, and S/MIME signing and encryption for applications that support it.

Intune now supports the following derived credential providers with Android:
- Entrust
- Intercede

A third provider, DISA Purebred, will be available for Android in a future release.

#### Microsoft Edge security baseline is now Generally Available<!--6586139 -->

A new version of the [Microsoft Edge security baseline](../protect/security-baselines.md#available-security-baselines) is now available, and is released as generally available (GA). The previous Microsoft Edge baseline was in Preview.  The new baseline version is April 2020 (Microsoft Edge version 80 and later). 

With the release of this new baseline, you'll no longer be able to create profiles based on the previous baseline versions, but you can continue to use profiles you created with those versions. You can also choose to [update your existing profiles to use the latest baseline version](../protect/security-baselines-configure.md).

You can add and deploy scripts to macOS devices. This support extends your ability to configure macOS devices beyond what is possible using native MDM capabilities on macOS devices. For more information, see [Use shell scripts on macOS devices in Intune](../apps/macos-shell-scripts.md).

#### macOS and iOS Company Portal updates<!-- 5779439, 5780234  -->
The Profile pane of the macOS and iOS Company Portal has been updated to include the sign-out button. Also, UI improvements have been made to the Profile pane in the macOS Company Portal. For more information about the Company Portal, see [How to configure the Microsoft Intune Company Portal app](../apps/company-portal-app.md).

#### Retarget web clips to Microsoft Edge on iOS devices<!-- 5455276   -->
Newly deployed web clips (pinned web apps) on iOS devices that are required to open in a protected browser, will open in Microsoft Edge rather than the Intune Managed Browser. You must retarget pre-existing web clips to ensure they open in Microsoft Edge rather than the Managed Browser. For more information, see [Manage web access by using Microsoft Edge with Microsoft Intune](../apps/manage-microsoft-edge.md) and [Add web apps to Microsoft Intune](../apps/web-app.md).

#### Use the Intune diagnostic tool with Microsoft Edge for Android<!-- 4735244  -->
Microsoft Edge for Android is now integrated with the Intune diagnostic tool. Similarly to the experience on Microsoft Edge for iOS, entering "about:intunehelp" into the URL bar (the address box) of Microsoft Edge on the device will start the Intune diagnostic tool. This tool will provide detailed logs. Users can be guided to collect and send these logs to their IT department, or view MAM logs for specific apps.

#### Updates to Intune branding and customization<!-- 5236032  -->
We have updated the Intune pane that was named "Branding and customization" with improvements, including:

- Renaming the pane to **Customization**.

- Improving the settings text and tooltips.

To find these settings in Intune, navigate to the [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431), select **Tenant administration** > **Customization**. For information about existing customization, see [How to configure the Microsoft Intune Company Portal app](../apps/company-portal-app.md).

#### User's personal encrypted recovery key<!-- 6273943  -->
A new Intune feature is available that enables users to retrieve their personal encrypted **FileVault** recovery key for Mac devices through the Android Company Portal application or through the Android Intune application. There is a link in both the Company Portal application and Intune application that will open a Chrome browser to the Web Company Portal where the user can see the **FileVault** recovery key needed to access their Mac devices. For more information about encryption, see [Use device Encryption with Intune](../protect/encrypt-devices.md).

#### Optimized dedicated device enrollment <!-- 6114580  -->
We're optimizing the enrollment for Android Enterprise dedicated devices and making it easier for SCEP certificates associated with Wi-Fi to apply to dedicated devices enrolled prior to November 22, 2019. For new enrollments, the Intune app will continue to install, but end-users will no longer need to perform the **Enable Intune Agent** step during enrollment. Installment will happen in the background automatically and SCEP certificates associated with Wi-Fi can be deployed and set without end-user interaction.  

These changes roll out in phases throughout the month of March as the Intune service backend deploys. All tenants will have this new behavior by the end of March. For more information, see [Support for SCEP certificates in Android Enterprise dedicated devices](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/intune-customer-success/support-for-scep-certificates-in-android-enterprise-dedicated/ba-p/928147).

### Device configuration

#### New user experience when creating administrative templates on Windows devices<!--5096036 -->
Based on customer feedback, and our move to the new Azure full screen experience, we've rebuilt the Administrative Templates profile experience with a folder view. We haven't made changes to any settings or existing profiles. So, your existing profiles will stay the same, and will be usable in the new view. You can still navigate all settings options by selecting **All Settings**, and using search. The tree view is split by Computer and User configurations. You will find Windows, Office, and Microsoft Edge settings in their associated folders.  

Applies to:
- Windows 10 and newer

#### VPN profiles with IKEv2 VPN connections can use always on with iOS/iPadOS devices<!-- 1947932   -->
On iOS/iPadOS devices, you can create a VPN profile that uses an IKEv2 connection (**Devices** > **Configuration** > **Create** > **iOS/iPadOS** for platform > **VPN** for profile type). Now, you can configure always-on with IKEv2. When configured, IKEv2 VPN profiles connect automatically, and stay connected (or quickly reconnect) to the VPN. It stays connected even when moving between networks or restarting devices.

On iOS/iPadOS, always-on VPN is limited to IKEv2 profiles.

To see the IKEv2 settings you can configure, go to [Add VPN settings on iOS devices in Microsoft Intune](../configuration/vpn-settings-ios.md#ikev2-settings).

Applies to:

#### Configure the iOS/iPadOS Microsoft Entra SSO app extension<!-- 5672534   -->
The Microsoft Entra team created a redirect single sign-on (SSO) app extension to allow iOS/iPadOS 13.0+ users to gain access to Microsoft apps and websites with one sign-on. All apps that previously had brokered authentication with the Microsoft Authenticator app will continue to get SSO with the new SSO extension. With the Microsoft Entra SSO app extension release, you can configure the SSO extension with the redirect SSO app extension type (**Devices** > **Configuration** > **Create** > **iOS/iPadOS** for platform > **Device features** for profile type > **Single sign-on app extension**).

Applies to:
- iOS 13.0 and newer
- iPadOS 13.0 and newer

For more information about iOS SSO app extensions, see [Single sign-on app extension](../configuration/device-features-configure.md#single-sign-on-sso).

#### Enterprise app trust settings modification setting is removed from iOS/iPadOS device restriction profiles<!-- 6225131   -->
On iOS/iPadOS devices, you create a device restrictions profile (**Devices** > **Configuration** > **Create** > **iOS/iPadOS** for platform > **Device restrictions** for profile type). The **Enterprise app trust settings modification** setting is removed by Apple, and is removed from Intune. If you currently use this setting in a profile, it has no impact, and is removed from existing profiles. This setting is also removed from any reporting in Intune.

We've updated the UI for [creating compliance policies](../protect/create-compliance-policy.md#create-the-policy) in the Microsoft Intune admin center (**Devices** > **Compliance policies** > **Policies** > **Create Policy**). We've a new user experience that includes the same settings and details you've used previously. The new experience follows a wizard-like process to create the compliance policy. It includes a page where you can add *Assignments* for the policy, and a *Review + Create* page where you can review your configuration before creating the policy.

#### Retire noncompliant devices<!-- 1827291       -->
We've added a new action for noncompliant devices that you can add to any policy, to  [retire the noncompliant device](../protect/actions-for-noncompliance.md#add-actions-for-noncompliance).  The new action, **Retire the noncompliant device**, results in removal of all company data from the device, and also removes the device from being managed by Intune.  This action runs when the configured value in days is reached and at that point the device becomes eligible to be retired. The minimum value is 30 days.  Explicit IT admin approval will be required to retire the devices by using  the *Retire Non-compliant devices* section, where admins can retire all eligible devices.

#### Support for WPA and WPA2 in iOS Enterprise Wi-Fi profiles<!--6215273   -->
[Enterprise Wi-Fi profiles for iOS](../configuration/wi-fi-settings-ios.md#enterprise-profiles) now support the *Security type* field. For *Security type*, you can select either of **WPA Enterprise** or **WPA/WPA2 Enterprise**, and then specify a selection for the *EAP type*.  (**Devices** > **Configuration** > **Create** and select **iOS/iPadOS** for *Platform* and then **Wi-Fi** for *Profile*). 

The new Enterprise options are like those that have been available for a Basic Wi-Fi profile for iOS.

You won't need to modify existing configurations with the new experience.

- Derived credential
- Email
- PKCS certificate
- PKCS imported certificate
- SCEP certificate
- Trusted certificate
- VPN
- Wi-Fi

### Device management

#### New Android report on Android Devices overview page<!-- 5435435   -->
We've added a report to the Microsoft Intune admin center in the Android Devices overview page that displays how many Android devices have been enrolled in each device management solution. This chart (like the same chart already in the Azure console) shows work profile, fully managed, dedicated, and device administrator enrolled device counts. To see the report, choose **Devices** > **Android** > **Overview**.

#### Guide users from Android device administrator management to work profile management<!--5857738   -->
We're releasing a new compliance setting for the Android device administrator platform. This setting lets you make a device noncompliant if it's managed with device administrator.

On these noncompliant devices, on the **Update device settings** page users will see the **Move to new device management setup** message. If they tap the **Resolve** button, they'll be guided through:

1. Unenrolling from device administrator management
2. Enrolling in work profile management
3. Resolving compliance issues 
 
Google is decreasing device administrator support in new Android releases to move to modern, richer, and more secure device management with Android Enterprise.  Intune can only provide full support for device administrator-managed Android devices running Android 10 and later through Q2 CY2020. Device administrator-managed devices (except Samsung) that are running Android 10 or later after this time won't be able to be entirely managed. In particular, affected devices won't receive new password requirements.

For more information about this setting, see [Move Android devices from device administrator to work profile management](../enrollment/android-move-device-admin-work-profile.md). 

#### New URL for the Microsoft Intune admin center<!-- 3704810 -->

- Co-management

<!-- vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv -->
### Security

#### Use a preview of security administrator focused policies as part of Endpoint security<!--6131401  -->
As a public preview, we've added several new policy groups under the Endpoint security node in the Microsoft Intune admin center. As a security admin you can use these new policies to focus on specific aspects of device security to manage discrete groups of related settings without the overhead of the larger Device Configuration policy body.

Except for the new *Antivirus policy for Microsoft Defender Antivirus* (see below), the settings in each new of these new preview policies and profiles are the same settings that you might already configure through [Device configuration profiles](../configuration/device-profile-create.md) today.

The following are the new policy types that are all in preview, and their available profile types:

- **Antivirus (Preview)**:
  - macOS:
    - **Antivirus** - Manage [Antivirus policy settings](../protect/antivirus-microsoft-defender-settings-macos.md) for macOS to manage [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint for Mac](/windows/security/threat-protection/microsoft-defender-atp/microsoft-defender-atp-mac).

  - Windows 10 and later:
    - **Microsoft Defender Antivirus** - Manage [Antivirus policy settings](../protect/antivirus-microsoft-defender-settings-windows.md) for cloud protection, Antivirus exclusions, remediation, scan options, and more.

      The Antivirus profile for *Microsoft Defender Antivirus* is an exception that introduces a new instance of settings that are found as part of a device restriction profile. These new Antivirus settings:

        - Are the same settings as found in device restrictions, but support a third option for configuration that's not available when configured as a device restriction.
        - Apply to devices that are co-managed with Configuration Manager, when the [co-management workload slider](/configmgr/comanage/how-to-switch-workloads) for Endpoint Protection is set to Intune.

     Plan to use the new *Antivirus* > *Microsoft Defender Antivirus* profile in place of configuring them through a device restriction profile.

  - **Windows Security experience** - Manage the Windows Security settings that end users can view in the Microsoft Defender Security center and the notifications they receive. These settings are unchanged from the settings available as a Device configuration Endpoint Protection profile.

- **Disk encryption (Preview)**:
  - macOS:
    - **FileVault**
  - Windows 10 and later:
    - **BitLocker**
- **Firewall (Preview)**:
  - macOS:
    - **macOS firewall**
  - Windows 10 and later:
    - **Microsoft Defender Firewall**
- **Endpoint detection and response (Preview)**:
  - Windows 10 and later:
    -**Windows 10 Intune**
- **Attack surface reduction (Preview)**:
  - Windows 10 and later:
    - **App and browser isolation**
    - **Web protection**
    - **Application control**
    - **Attack surface reduction rules**
    - **Device control**
    - **Exploit protection**
- **Account protection (Preview)**:
  - Windows 10 and later:
    - **Account protection**

<!-- vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv -->
### Device security

#### Improved Intune reporting experience<!-- 3791418   -->
Intune now provides an improved reporting experience. There are new report types, better report organization, more focused views, improved report functionality, and more consistent and timely data. The reporting experience will move from public preview to GA (general availability). Also, the GA release will provide localization support, bug fixes, design improvements, and aggregate device compliance data on tiles in the [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431).

New report types focus on the following information:

- **Operational** - Provides fresh records with a negative health focus. 
- **Organizational** - Provides a broader summary of the overall state.
- **Historical** - Provides patterns and trends over a period of time.
- **Specialist** - Allows you to use raw data to create your own custom reports.

The first set of new reports focuses on device compliance. For more information, see [Blog - Microsoft Intune reporting framework](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Intune-Customer-Success/New-Reporting-Framework-Coming-to-Intune/ba-p/1009553) and [Intune reports](reports.md).

#### Consolidated the location of security baselines in the UI<!-- 6177074   -->
We've consolidated the paths to find [security baselines](../protect/security-baselines.md) in the Microsoft Intune admin center by removing *Security baselines* from several UI locations. To find security baselines, you now use the following path:  **Endpoint security** > **Security baselines**.

#### Expanded support for imported PKCS certificates<!-- 6044197  -->
We've expanded support for using [imported PKCS certificates](../protect/certificates-imported-pfx-configure.md#supported-platforms) to support *Android Enterprise fully managed devices*. Generally, importing PFX certificates is used for S/MIME encryption scenarios, where a user's encryption certificates are required on all of their devices so that email decryption can occur.

The following platforms support import of PFX certificates:

- Android - Device Administrator
- Android Enterprise - Fully Managed
- Android Enterprise - Work profile
- iOS
- Mac
- Windows 10

#### View the endpoint security configuration for devices<!-- 6206460  -->
We've updated the name of the option in the Microsoft Intune admin center, for viewing [endpoint security configurations that apply to a specific device](../protect/security-baselines-monitor.md). This option is renamed to **Endpoint security configuration** because it shows applicable security baselines and other policies created outside of security baselines. Previously, this option was named *Security baselines*.

<!-- vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv -->
### Role-based access control

#### Intune Roles user interface changes coming<!--5801612   -->
The user interface for [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431) > **Tenant administration** > **Roles** has been improved to a more user-friendly and intuitive design. This experience provides the same settings and details that you use now, however the new experience employs a wizard-like process.

However, end users will continue to see all user-licensed VPP apps within the Company Portal. For more information about VPP apps, see [How to manage iOS and macOS apps purchased through Apple Volume Purchase Program with Microsoft Intune](../apps/vpp-apps-ios.md).

#### Notice - Windows 10 1703 (RS2) will be moving out of support <!-- 5026679 -->
Starting October 9, 2018, Windows 10 1703 (RS2) moved out of Microsoft platform support for Home, Pro, and Pro for Workstations editions. For Windows 10 Enterprise and Education editions, Windows 10 1703 (RS2) moved out of platform support on October 8, 2019. Starting December 26, 2019, we will be updating the minimum version of the Windows Company Portal application to Windows 10 1709 (RS3). Computers running versions prior to 1709 will no longer receive updated versions for the application from the Microsoft Store. We have previously communicated this change to customers who are managing older versions of Windows 10 via the message center. For more information, see [Windows lifecycle fact sheet](https://support.microsoft.com/help/13853/windows-lifecycle-fact-sheet).

<!-- vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv -->
### App management

#### Migrating to Microsoft Edge for managed browsing scenarios<!-- 5173762 -->
As we move closer to the retirement of the Intune Managed Browser, we made changes to app protection policies to simplify the steps needed to move your users over to Edge. We have updated the options for the app protection policy setting **Restrict web content transfer with other apps** to be one of the following:

- Any app
- Intune Managed Browser
- Microsoft Edge
- Unmanaged browser 

When you select **Microsoft Edge**, your end users will see conditional access messaging notifying them that Microsoft Edge is required for managed browsing scenarios. They will be prompted to download and sign in to Microsoft Edge with their Microsoft Entra accounts, if they haven't signed already.  This behavior will be the equivalent to having targeted your MAM-enabled apps with the app config setting `com.microsoft.intune.useEdge` set to **True**. Existing app protection policies that used the **Policy managed browsers** setting will now have **Intune Managed Browser** selected, and you will see no change in behavior. So, your users will see messaging to use Microsoft Edge if you've set the **useEdge** app configuration setting to **True**. We encourage all customers using managed browsing scenarios to update their app protection policies with **Restrict web content transfer with other apps** to ensure users are seeing the proper guidance to transition to Microsoft Edge, no matter which app they are launching links from. 

#### Configure app notification content for organization accounts<!-- 2576686  -->
Intune app protection policies (APP) on Android and iOS devices allow you to control app notification content for Org accounts. You can select an option (Allow, Block org Data, or Blocked) to specify how notifications for org accounts are shown for the selected app. This feature requires support from applications and might not be available for all APP enabled applications. Outlook for iOS version 4.15.0 (or later) and Outlook for Android 4.83.0 (or later) will support this setting. The setting is available in the console, but the functionality will begin to take effect after December 16, 2019. For more about APP, see [What are app protection policies?](../apps/app-protection-policy.md).

#### Microsoft app icons update<!--4677605  -->
The icons used for Microsoft apps in the app targeting pane for App protection policies and App configuration policies have been updated.

#### Require use of approved keyboards on Android<!--4761794  -->
As part of an app protection policy, you can specify the setting [**Approved keyboards**](../apps/app-protection-policy-settings-android.md#data-protection) to manage which Android keyboards can be used with managed Android apps. When a user opens the managed app and doesn't already use an approved keyboard for that app, they are prompted to switch to one of the approved keyboards already installed on their device. If needed, they're presented with a link to download an approved keyboard from the Google Play Store, which they can install and set up. The user can only edit text fields in a managed app when their active keyboard isn't one of the approved keyboards.

<!-- vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv -->
### Device configuration

#### Updates to Administrative Templates for Windows 10 devices <!-- 5941568 -->

You can use ADMX templates in Microsoft Intune to control and manage settings for Microsoft Edge, Office, and Windows. Administrative Templates in Intune made the following policy setting updates:

- Added support for Microsoft Edge versions 78 and 79.
- Includes the November 11, 2019 ADMX files in [Administrative Template files (ADMX/ADML) and Office Customization Tool for Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise, Office 2019, and Office 2016](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=49030).

For more information on ADMX templates in Intune, see [Use Windows 10 templates to configure group policy settings in Microsoft Intune](../configuration/administrative-templates-windows.md).

Applies to:

- Windows 10 and later

#### Updated single sign-on experience for apps and websites on your iOS, iPadOS, and macOS devices<!-- 4999578  -->
Intune has added more single sign-on (SSO) settings for iOS, iPadOS, and macOS devices. You can now configure redirect SSO app extensions written by your organization or by your identity provider. Use these settings to configure a seamless single sign-on experience for apps and websites that use modern authentication methods, such as OAuth and SAML2. 

These new settings expand on the previous settings for SSO app extensions and Apple's built-in Kerberos extension (**Devices** > **Configuration** > **Create** > **iOS/iPadOS** or **macOS** for platform type > **Device features** for profile type). 

To see the full range of SSO app extension settings you can configure, go to [SSO on iOS](../configuration/ios-device-features-settings.md#single-sign-on-app-extension) and [SSO on macOS](../configuration/macos-device-features-settings.md#single-sign-on-app-extension).

Applies to:

- iOS/iPadOS
- macOS

#### We have updated two device restriction settings for iOS and iPadOS devices to correct their behavior<!-- 5701352    -->
For iOS devices, you can create device restriction profiles that **Allow over-the-air PKI updates** and **Blocks USB Restricted mode** (**Devices** > **Configuration** > **Create** > **iOS/iPadOS** for platform > **Device restrictions** for profile type). Prior to this release, the UI settings and descriptions for the following settings were incorrect, and they have now been corrected. Beginning with this release, the settings behavior is as follows:

**Block over-the-air PKI updates**: **Block** prevents your users from receiving software updates unless the device is connected to a computer. **Not configured** (default): allows a device to receive software updates without being connected to a computer.
- Previously, this setting let you configure it as: **Allow**, which let your users receive software updates without connecting their devices to a computer.
**Allow USB accessories while device is locked**: **Allow** lets USB accessories exchange data with a device that's been locked for over an hour. **Not configured** (default) doesn't update USB Restricted mode on the device, and USB accessories will be blocked from transferring data from the device if locked for over an hour.
- Previously, this setting let you configure it as: **Block** to disable USB Restricted mode on supervised devices.

For more information on the setting you can configure, see [iOS and iPadOS device settings to allow or restrict features using Intune](../configuration/device-restrictions-ios.md).

This feature applies to:

- OS/iPadOS

#### Block users from configuring certificate credentials in the managed keystore on Android Enterprise device owner devices<!-- 3311998 -->
On Android Enterprise device owner devices, you can configure a new setting that blocks users from configuring their certificate credentials in the managed keystore (**Devices** > **Configuration** > **Create** > **Android Enterprise** for platform > **Device Owner Only > Device Restrictions** for profile type > **Users + Accounts**).

#### New Microsoft Configuration Manager co-management licensing<!--5027281-->
Configuration Manager customers with Software Assurance can get Intune co-management for Windows 10 PCs without having to purchase another Intune license for co-management. Customers no longer need to assign individual Intune/EMS licenses to their end users for co-managing Windows 10.
- Devices managed by Configuration Manager and enrolled into co-management have almost the same rights as Intune Standalone MDM-managed PCs. However, after resetting they can't be re-provisioned by using Autopilot.
- Windows 10 devices enrolled into Intune by using other means require full Intune licenses.
- Devices on other platforms still require full Intune licenses.

For more information, see [Licensing terms](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/Licensing/product-licensing/products).

### Device management

#### Protected wipe action now available<!--51150000 -->
You now can use the Wipe device action to perform a protected wipe of a device. Protected wipes are the same as standard wipes, except that they can't be circumvented by powering off the device. A protected wipe will keep trying to reset the device until successful. In some configurations, this action might leave the device unable to reboot. For more information, see [Retire or wipe devices](../remote-actions/devices-wipe.md).

#### Device Ethernet MAC address added to device's Overview page<!--5562275 -->
You can now see a device's Ethernet MAC address on the device details page (**Devices** > **All devices** > choose a device > **Overview**.

<!-- vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv -->
### Device security

#### Improved experience on a shared device when device-based conditional access policies are enabled<!-- 1734096  -->
We improved the experience on a shared device with multiple users who are targeted with device-based conditional access policy by checking the latest compliance evaluation for the user when enforcing policy. 
For more information, see  the following overview articles:
- [Azure overview for Conditional Access](/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/overview)
- [Intune device compliance overview](../protect/device-compliance-get-started.md)

#### Use PKCS certificate profiles to provision devices with certificates<!-- 2317124, 2317130, 2317139, 2340517, 2340528, 2340529  -->
You can now use PKCS certificate profiles to issue certificates to *devices* that run Android for Work, iOS/iPadOS, and Windows, when associated with profiles like those for Wi-Fi and VPN. Previously those three platforms supported only user-based certificates, with device-based support being limited to macOS.

> [!NOTE]
> PKCS certificate profiles are not supported with Wi-Fi profiles. Instead, use SCEP certificate profiles when you use an [EAP type](../configuration/wi-fi-settings-windows.md#enterprise-profile).

To use a device-based certificate, while [creating a PKCS certificate profile](../protect/certificates-pfx-configure.md#create-a-pkcs-certificate-profile) for the supported platforms, select **Settings**. You'll now see the setting for **Certificate type**, which supports the options for Device, or User.

### App management

#### UI update when selectively wiping app data<!-- 4102028 -->
The UI to selectively wipe app data in Intune has been updated. UI changes include:
- A simplified experience by using a wizard-style format condensed within one pane.
- An update to the create flow to include assignments.
- A summarized page of all things set when viewing properties, prior to creating a new policy or when editing a property. Also, when editing properties, the summary will only show a list of items from the category of properties being edited.

For more information, see [How to wipe only corporate data from Intune-managed apps](../apps/apps-selective-wipe.md).

#### iOS and iPadOS third party keyboard support<!-- 4922950 -->
In March  2019, we announced the removal of support for the iOS App protection policy setting **Third party keyboards**. The feature is returning to Intune with both iOS and iPadOS support. To enable this setting, visit the **Data protection** tab of a new or existing iOS/iPadOS app protection policy and find the **Third party keyboards** setting under **Data Transfer**.

The behavior of this policy setting differs slightly from the previous implementation. In multi-identity apps using SDK version 12.0.16 and later, targeted by app protection policies with this setting configured to **Block**, end users will be unable to opt for third party/partner keyboards in both their organization and personal accounts. Apps using SDK versions 12.0.12 and earlier will continue to exhibit the behavior documented in our blog post title, [Known issue: Third party keyboards are not blocked in iOS for personal accounts](https://aka.ms/3rdparty_iOS_Intune).


#### Improved macOS enrollment experience in Company Portal <!-- 5074349  -->  
The Company Portal for macOS enrollment experience has a simpler enrollment process that aligns more closely with the Company Portal for iOS enrollment experience. Device users now see:  

- A sleeker user interface.  
- An improved enrollment checklist.  
- Clearer instructions about how to enroll their devices.

#### Windows 10 feature updates (public preview)<!-- 2384877 -->
You can now deploy [Windows 10 feature updates](../protect/windows-10-feature-updates.md) to Windows 10 devices. Windows 10 feature updates are a new software update policy that sets the version of Windows 10 that you want devices to install and remain at. You can use this new policy type along with your existing Windows 10 update rings.

Devices that receive Windows 10 feature updates policy install the specified version of Windows, and then remain at that version until the policy is edited or removed. Devices that run a later version of Windows remain at their current version. Devices that are held at a specific version of Windows can still install quality and security updates for that version from Windows 10 update rings.

This new type of policy begins rolling out to tenants this week. If this policy isn't available for your tenant yet, it will be soon.

#### Add and change key information in plist files for macOS applications<!-- 4736278 -->
On macOS devices, you can now create a device configuration profile that uploads a property list file (.plist) associated with an app or with the device (**Devices** > **Configuration** > **Create** > **macOS** for platform > **Preference File** for profile type).

Only some apps support managed preferences, and these apps might not allow you to manage all settings. Be sure to upload a property list file that configures device channel settings, not user channel settings.

For more information on this feature, see [Add a property list file to macOS devices using Microsoft Intune](../configuration/preference-file-settings-macos.md).

#### Android Company Portal enforced minimum app version<!-- 2378776 -->
By using the **Min Company Portal version** setting of an app protection policy, you can specify a specific minimum defined version of the Company Portal that is enforced on an end user device. This conditional launch setting allows you to **Block access**, **Wipe data**, or **Warn** as possible actions when the value isn't met. The possible formats for this value follow the *[Major].[Minor]*, *[Major].[Minor].[Build]*, or *[Major].[Minor].[Build].[Revision]* pattern.

The **Min Company Portal version** setting, if configured, will affect any end user who gets version 5.0.4560.0 of the Company Portal and any future versions of the Company Portal. This setting will have no effect on users using a version of Company Portal that is older than the version that this feature is released with. End users using app auto-updates on their device will likely not see any dialogs from this feature, given that they will likely be on the latest Company Portal version. This setting is Android only with app protection for enrolled and unenrolled devices. For more information, see [Android app protection policy settings - Conditional launch](../apps/app-protection-policy-settings-android.md#conditional-launch).

#### Add Mobile Threat Defense apps to unenrolled devices<!-- 3005337 -->
You can create an Intune app protection policy that can block, or selectively wipe the users corporate data based on the health of a device. The health of the device is determined using your chosen Mobile Threat Defense (MTD) solution. This capability exists today with Intune enrolled devices as a device compliance setting. With this new feature, we extend the threat detection from a Mobile Threat Defense vendor to function on unenrolled devices. On Android, this feature requires the latest Company Portal on the device. On iOS, this feature will be available for use when apps integrate the latest Intune SDK (v 12.0.15+). We'll update the What's New article when the first app adopts the latest Intune SDK. The remaining apps will become available on a rolling basis. For more information, see [Create Mobile Threat Defense app protection policy with Intune](../protect/mtd-app-protection-policy.md).

####   Derived Credentials to provision iOS mobile devices with certificates<!--  1736036, 1736037, 1772050, 2777333         -->  
Intune supports use of [derived credentials](../protect/derived-credentials.md) as an authentication method and for S/MIME signing and encryption for iOS devices. Derived credentials are an implementation of the *National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) 800-157* standard for deploying certificates to devices.  

Derived credentials rely on the use of a Personal Identity Verification (PIV) or Common Access Card (CAC) card, like a smart card. To get a derived credential for their mobile device, users start in the Company Portal app and follow an enrollment workflow that is unique to the provider you use.  Common to all providers is the requirement to use a smart card on a computer to authenticate to the derived credential provider. That provider then issues a certificate to the device that's derived from the user's smart card.  

Intune supports the following derived credential providers:
- DISA Purebred
- Entrust
- Intercede

You use derived credentials as the authentication method for device configuration profiles for VPN, Wi-Fi, and email. You can also use them for app authentication, and S/MIME signing and encryption.  

For more information about the standard, see [Derived PIV Credentials](https://www.nccoe.nist.gov/projects/building-blocks/piv-credentials) at www.nccoe.nist.gov.

#### Use Graph API to specify an on-premises User Principal Name as a variable for SCEP certificates<!--  5437939        -->  
When you use the [Intune Graph API](/graph/api/resources/intune-graph-overview?view=graph-rest-1.0&preserve-view=true), you can specify onPremisesUserPrincipalName as a variable for the Subject Alternative Name (SAN) for SCEP certificates.

### App management

#### Managed Google Play private LOB apps<!-- 1464182  -->'
Intune now allows IT admins to publish private Android LOB apps to Managed Google Play via an iframe embedded in the Intune console.  Previously, IT admins needed to publish LOB apps directly to Google's Play publishing console, which required several steps and was time consuming. This new feature allows for easy publishing of LOB apps with a minimal set of steps, without needing to leave the Intune console.  Admins will no longer need to manually register as a developer with Google, and will no longer need to pay the Google $25 registration fee.  Any of the Android Enterprise management scenarios that use Managed Google Play can take advantage of this feature (work profile, dedicated, fully managed, and non-enrolled devices). From Intune, select **Client apps** > **Apps** > **Add**. Then, select **Managed Google Play** from the **App type** list. For more information about Managed Google Play apps, see [Add Managed Google Play apps to Android Enterprise devices with Intune](../apps/apps-add-android-for-work.md).

#### Windows Company Portal experience<!-- 1473353, 3598357 -->
The Windows Company Portal is being updated. You can use multiple filters on the Apps page within the Windows Company Portal. The Device Details page is also being updated with an improved user experience. We are in the process of rolling out these updates to all customers and expect to be completed by the end of next week.

#### macOS support for web apps<!-- 3174427 -->
Web apps, which allow you to add a shortcut to a URL on the web, can be installed to the Dock using the macOS Company Portal. End users can access the **Install** action from the app details page for a web app in the macOS Company Portal. For more information about the **Web link** app type, see [Add apps to Microsoft Intune](../apps/apps-add.md) and [Add web apps to Microsoft Intune](../apps/web-app.md).

#### macOS support for VPP apps<!-- 3173501  -->
macOS apps purchased using Apple Business Manager, are displayed in the console when Apple VPP tokens are synced in Intune. You can assign, revoke and reassign device and user-based licenses for groups using the Intune console. Microsoft Intune helps you manage VPP apps purchased for use at your company by:

- Reporting license information from the app store.
- Tracking how many of the licenses you have used.
- Helping you prevent installation of more copies of the app than your organization owns.

For more information about Intune and VPP, see [Manage volume-purchased apps and books with Microsoft Intune](../apps/vpp-apps.md).

#### Managed Google Play iframe support<!-- 2871756  -->
Intune now provides support for adding and managing web links directly in the  Intune console via the Managed Google Play iframe.  This feature lets IT admins submit a URL and icon graphic, and then deploy those links to devices just like regular Android apps. Any of the Android Enterprise management scenarios that use Managed Google Play can take advantage of this feature (work profile, dedicated, fully managed, and non-enrolled devices). From Intune, select **Client apps** > **Apps** > **Add**. Then, select **Managed Google Play** from the **App type** list. For more information about Managed Google Play apps, see [Add Managed Google Play apps to Android Enterprise devices with Intune](../apps/apps-add-android-for-work.md).

#### Silently install Android LOB apps on Zebra devices<!-- 4252734  -->
When installing Android line-of-business (LOB) apps on [Zebra devices](../configuration/android-zebra-mx-overview.md), rather than being prompted to both download and install the LOB app, you can install the app silently. In Intune, select **Client apps** > **Apps** > **Add**. In the **Select app type** pane, select **Line-of-business app**. For more information, see [Add an Android line-of-business app to Microsoft Intune](../apps/lob-apps-android.md).

Currently, after the LOB app is downloaded, a **download success** notification will appear on the user's device. The notification can only be dismissed by tapping **Clear All** in the notification shade. This notification issue will be fixed in an upcoming release, and the installation will be silent with no visual indicators.

#### Read and write Graph API operations for Intune apps<!-- 5031704  -->
Applications can call the Intune Graph API with both read and write operations using app identity without user credentials. For more information about accessing the Microsoft Graph API for Intune, see [Working with Intune in Microsoft Graph](/graph/api/resources/intune-graph-overview?view=graph-rest-1.0&preserve-view=true).

#### Protected data sharing and encryption for Intune App SDK for iOS<!-- 3586942  -->
The Intune App SDK for iOS will use 256-bit encryption keys when encryption is enabled by App Protection Policies. All apps will need to have an SDK version 8.1.1 to allow protected data sharing.

#### Updates to Microsoft Intune app<!-- 4997846 -->
The Microsoft Intune app for Android has been updated with the following improvements:

#### Deadlines replace Engaged restart settings for Windows Update rings<!-- 4464404        -->
To align with recent [Windows servicing changes](/windows/whats-new/whats-new-windows-10-version-1903#servicing), Intune's Windows 10 Update rings now [support settings for deadlines](../protect/windows-update-settings.md). *Deadlines* determine when a device installs feature and security updates.  On devices that run Windows 10 1903 or later, *deadlines* supersede configurations for *engaged restart*.  In the future, *deadlines* will supersede *engaged restart* on earlier versions of Windows 10 as well.  

When you don't' configure *deadlines*, devices continue to use their *engaged restart* settings, however Intune will deprecate support for engaged restart settings in a future update.  

Plan to use *deadlines* for all your Windows 10 devices. After settings for *deadlines* are in place, you can change your Intune configurations for *engaged restart* to be Not configured. When set to Not configured, Intune stops managing those settings on devices but doesn't remove the last configurations for the setting from the device. Therefore, the last configurations that were set for *engaged restart* remain active and in use on devices until those settings are modified by a method other than Intune. Later, when the devices version of Windows changes or when Intune support for *deadlines* expands to the devices Windows version, the device will begin to use the new settings, which are already in place.

#### Support for multiple Microsoft Intune Certificate Connectors<!--   4704642      -->
Intune now supports install and use of multiple [Microsoft Intune Certificate Connectors for PKCS operations](../protect/certificates-pfx-configure.md). This change supports load balancing and high availability of the connector. Each connector instance can process certificate requests from Intune.  If one connector is unavailable, other connectors continue to process requests.

To use multiple connectors, you don't need to upgrade to the latest version of the connector software.  

#### New settings, and changes to existing settings to restrict features on iOS and macOS devices<!-- 4867699 4867709   -->
You can create profiles to restrict settings on devices running iOS and macOS (**Devices** > **Configuration** > **Create** > **iOS** or **macOS** for platform type > **Device restrictions**). This update includes the following features:

### Device enrollment

#### Updates for Enrollment Restrictions<!-- 2871968 -->
Enrollment Restrictions for new tenants have been updated so that Android Enterprise work profiles are allowed by default. Existing tenants will experience no change. To use Android Enterprise work profiles, you still need to [connect your Intune account to your Managed Google Play account](../enrollment/connect-intune-android-enterprise.md).

#### UI updates for Apple enrollment and enrollment restrictions<!--4089575, 4089579  -->
Both of the following processes use a wizard-style user interface:
- Apple device enrollment. For more information, see [Automatically enroll iOS devices with Apple's Device Enrollment Program](../enrollment/device-enrollment-program-enroll-ios.md).
- Enrollment restriction creation. For more information, see [Set enrollment restrictions](../enrollment/enrollment-restrictions-set.md).

#### Handling pre-configuration of corporate device identifiers for Android Q devices<!-- 4711509   -->
In Android Q (v10), Google will remove the ability for MDM agents on legacy-managed (device administrator) Android devices to collect device identifier information. Admins can [pre-configure a list of device serial numbers or IMEIs](../enrollment/corporate-identifiers-add.md#identify-corporate-owned-devices-with-imei-or-serial-number) that automatically tags these devices as corporate-owned. This feature won't work for Android Q devices that are device admin-managed.  Regardless of whether the serial number or IMEI for the device is uploaded, it will always be considered to be personal during Intune enrollment.  You can manually switch ownership to corporate after enrollment.  This behavior affects new enrollments only, and existing enrolled devices are not affected. This change doesn't affect Android devices managed with work profiles, and they continue working as they do today.  Also, Android Q devices enrolled as device administrator will no longer be able to report serial number or IMEI in the Intune console as device properties.

#### Icons have changed for Android Enterprise enrollments (work profile, dedicated devices, and fully managed devices)<!-- 4977730 -->
The icons for Android Enterprise enrollment profiles have changed. To see the new icons, go to **Intune** > **Enrollment** > **Android enrollment** > look under **Enrollment profiles**.

#### Windows Diagnostic Data collection change<!-- 4113859 -->
The default value for diagnostic data collection has changed for devices running Windows 10, version 1903 and later. Starting with Windows 10 1903, diagnostic data collection is enabled by default. Windows diagnostic data is vital technical data from Windows devices about the device and how Windows and related software are performing. For more information, see [Configure Windows diagnostic data in your organization](/windows/privacy/configure-windows-diagnostic-data-in-your-organization). Autopilot devices are also opted into "Full" telemetry unless otherwise set in the Autopilot profile with [System/AllowTelemetry](/windows/client-management/mdm/policy-csp-system#system-allowtelemetry).

#### Windows Autopilot reset removes the device's primary user<!-- 4156123 -->
When Autopilot reset is used on a device, the device's primary user will be removed. The next user who signs in after the reset will be set as the primary user. This feature will be rolled out to all customers over the next few days.

Rules can specify inbound and outbound behavior to applications, network addresses, and ports. 

#### Updated UI for managing security baselines<!-- 4091125     -->
We've updated the [create and edit experience](../protect/security-baselines-configure.md) in the Intune console for our security baselines. Changes include:

A simpler wizard-style format that's been condensed to a single blade. within one blade. This new design does away with blade sprawl that requires IT Pros to drill down into several separate panes.  
You can now create Assignments as part of the create and edit experience, instead of having to return later to assign baselines. 
We've added a summarization of settings you can view prior to creating a new baseline and when editing an existing one. When editing, the summary only shows the list of items set within the one category of properties being edited.

### App management

#### Reporting for potentially harmful apps on Android devices<!-- 4223162 -->
Intune now provides more reporting information about potentially harmful apps on Android devices. 

#### Windows Company Portal app<!-- 3316993 -->
The Windows Company Portal app will now have a new page labeled **Devices**. The **Devices** page will show end users all of their enrolled devices. Users will see this change in the Company Portal when they use version 10.3.4291.0 and later. For information about the configuring the Company Portal, see [How to configure the Microsoft Intune Company Portal app](../apps/company-portal-app.md).

#### Intune policies update authentication method and Company Portal app installation<!-- 1927359  -->
On devices already enrolled via Setup Assistant through one of Apple's corporate device enrollment methods, Intune doesn't support the Company Portal when the app is manually installed from the app store. This change is only relevant when you authenticate with Apple Setup Assistant during enrollment. This change also only affects iOS devices enrolled through:  
* Apple configurator
* Apple Business Manager
* Apple School Manager
* Apple Device Enrollment Program (DEP)

If users install the Company Portal app from the App store, and then try to enroll these devices through it, they will receive an error. These devices will be expected to only use the Company Portal when it's been pushed, automatically, by Intune during enrollment. Enrollment profiles in Intune in the Azure portal will be updated so that you can specify how devices authenticate and if they receive the Company Portal app. If you want your DEP device users to have the Company Portal, you will need to specify your preferences in an enrollment profile. 

In addition, the **Identify your device** screen in the iOS Company Portal is being removed. Therefore, admins who want to enable Conditional Access or deploy company apps must update the DEP enrollment profile. This requirement only applies if the DEP enrollment is authenticated with Setup Assistant. In that case, you must push the Company Portal onto the device. To do so, choose **Intune** > **Device enrollment** > **Apple enrollment** > **Enrollment program tokens** > choose a token > **Profiles** > choose a profile > **Properties** > set **Install Company Portal** to **Yes**.

To install the Company Portal on already-enrolled DEP devices, you will need to go to Intune > Client apps, and push it as a managed app with app configuration policies. 

#### Configure how end users update a line-of-business (LOB) app using an app protection policy<!-- 3568384 -->
You can now configure where your end users can get an updated version of a line-of-business (LOB) app. End users will see this feature in the **min app version** conditional launch dialog, which will prompt end users to update to a minimum version of the LOB app. You must provide these update details as part of your LOB app protection policy (APP). This feature is available on iOS and Android. On iOS, this feature requires the app to be integrated (or wrapped using the wrapping tool) with the Intune SDK for iOS v. 10.0.7 or later. On Android, this feature would require the latest Company Portal. To configure how an end user updates a LOB app, the app needs a managed app configuration policy sent to it with the key, `com.microsoft.intune.myappstore`. The value sent will define which store the end user will download the app from. If the app is deployed via the Company Portal, the value must be `CompanyPortal`. For any other store, you must enter a complete URL.

#### Intune management extension PowerShell scripts<!-- 3734186  -->
You can configure PowerShell scripts to run with the user's admin privileges on the device. For more information, see [Use PowerShell scripts on Windows 10 devices in Intune](../apps/intune-management-extension.md) and [Win32 app management](../apps/app-management.md).

#### Android Enterprise app management<!-- 4459905 -->
To make it easier for IT admins to configure and use Android Enterprise management, Intune will automatically add four common Android Enterprise related apps to the Intune admin center. The four Android Enterprise apps are the following apps:

- **[Microsoft Intune](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.microsoft.intune)** - Used for Android Enterprise fully managed scenarios.
- **[Microsoft Authenticator](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.azure.authenticator)** - Helps you sign in to your accounts if you use two-factor verification.
- **[Intune Company Portal](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.microsoft.windowsintune.companyportal)** - Used for App Protection Policies (APP) and Android Enterprise work profile scenarios.
- [Managed Home Screen](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.microsoft.launcher.enterprise) - Used for Android Enterprise dedicated/kiosk scenarios.

Previously, IT admins would need to manually find and approve these apps in the [Managed Google Play store](https://play.google.com/store/apps) as part of setup. This change removes those previously manual steps to make it easier and faster for customers to use Android Enterprise management.

Admins will see these four apps automatically added to their Intune apps list at the time that they first connect their Intune tenant to managed Google Play. For more information, see [Connect your Intune account to your Managed Google Play account](../enrollment/connect-intune-android-enterprise.md). For tenants that have already connected their tenant or who already use Android Enterprise, there is nothing admins need to do. Those four apps will automatically show up within 7 days of the completion of the May 2019 service rollout.

#### Expanded support for Android Enterprise fully managed devices  (Preview)<!--   3903241, 3903244, 3903246   -->
Still in a public preview, we've expanded our support of Android Enterprise fully managed devices first announced in January of 2019 to include:

- On fully managed and dedicated devices, you can create [compliance policies](../protect/compliance-policy-create-android-for-work.md) to include password rules and operating system requirements (**Device compliance** > **Policies** > **Create policy** > **Android Enterprise** for platform > **Device owner** for profile type).

  On dedicated devices, the device might show as **Not compliant**. Conditional Access isn't available on dedicated devices. Be sure to complete any tasks or actions to get dedicated devices compliant with your assigned policies.

- [Conditional Access](../protect/conditional-access.md) - Conditional Access policies that apply to Android also apply to Android Enterprise fully managed devices. Users can now register their fully managed device in Microsoft Entra ID using the **Microsoft Intune app**. Then, see and resolve any compliance issues to access organizational resources.

- New end-user app (Microsoft Intune app) - There is a new end-user app for Android fully managed devices called **Microsoft Intune**. This new app is light-weight and modern, and provides similar functionally as the Company Portal app, but for fully managed devices. For more information, see [Microsoft Intune app on Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.microsoft.intune).

To set up Android fully managed devices, go to **Device enrollment** > **Android enrollment** > **Corporate-owned, fully managed user devices**. Support for fully managed Android devices remains in preview, and some Intune features might not be fully functional.  

To learn more about this preview, see our blog, [Microsoft Intune - Preview 2 for Android Enterprise Fully Managed devices](https://aka.ms/preview2_AE_fullymanaged).

#### Use Compliance Manager to create assessments for Microsoft Intune<!-- 4404750 -->

[Compliance Manager](https://servicetrust.microsoft.com/ComplianceManager) (opens another Microsoft site) is a workflow-based risk assessment tool in the Microsoft Service Trust Portal. It enables you to track, assign, and verify your organization's regulatory compliance activities related to Microsoft services. You can create your own compliance assessment with Microsoft 365, Azure, Dynamics, Professional Services, and Intune. Intune has two assessments available - FFIEC and GDPR.

Compliance Manager helps you focus your efforts by breaking down controls - controls managed by Microsoft, and controls managed by your organization. You can complete the assessments, and then export and print the assessments.

[Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC)](https://www.microsoft.com/trustcenter/compliance/FFIEC) (opens another Microsoft site) compliance is a set of standards for online banking issued by FFIEC. It's the most requested assessment for financial institutions that use Intune. It interprets how Intune helps meet FFIEC cybersecurity guidelines related to public cloud workloads. Intune's FFIEC assessment is the second FFIEC assessment in Compliance Manager.

In the following example, you can see the breakdown for FFIEC controls. Microsoft covers 64 controls. You're responsible for the remaining 12 controls.

![See a sample Intune assessment for FFIEC, including the customer actions and Microsoft actions](./media/whats-new/intune-ffiec-assessment-status.png)

[General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)](https://www.microsoft.com/trustcenter/privacy/gdpr/gdpr-overview) (opens another Microsoft site) is a European Union (EU) law that helps protect the rights of individuals and their data. GDPR is the most requested assessment to help comply with privacy regulations. 

In the following example, you see the breakdown for GDPR controls. Microsoft covers 49 controls. You're responsible for the remaining 66 controls.

### App management
#### Intune macOS Company Portal Dark Mode<!-- 3300524  -->
The Intune macOS Company Portal now supports Dark Mode for macOS. When you enable Dark Mode on a macOS 10.14+ device, the Company Portal will adjust its appearance to colors that reflect that mode.

#### Intune will use Google Play Protect APIs on Android devices<!-- 2577355   -->
Some IT admins are faced with a BYOD landscape where end users root or jailbreak their mobile phone. This behavior, while sometimes not ill-intentioned, results in a bypass of many Intune policies that are set in order to protect the organization's data on end-user devices. Thus, Intune provides root and jailbreak detection for both enrolled and unenrolled devices. With this release, Intune will now use Google Play Protect APIs to add to our existing root detection checks for unenrolled devices. While Google does not share the entirety of the root detection checks that occur, we expect these APIs to detect users who have rooted their devices for any reason from device customization to being able to get newer OS updates on older devices. These users can then be blocked from accessing corporate data, or their corporate accounts can be wiped from their policy enabled apps.

For more value, the IT admin will now have several reporting updates within the Intune App Protection blade. The "Flagged Users" report will show which users are detected via Google Play Protect's SafetyNet API scan. The "Potentially Harmful Apps" report will show which apps are detected via Google's Verify Apps API scanning. This feature is available on Android.

#### Win32 app information available in Troubleshooting blade<!-- 2617342   -->
You can now collect failure log files for a Win32 app installation from the Intune app **Troubleshooting** blade. For more information about app installation troubleshooting, see [Troubleshoot app installation issues](/troubleshoot/mem/intune/troubleshoot-app-install) and [Troubleshoot Win32 app issues](/troubleshoot/mem/intune/troubleshoot-app-install#win32-app-installation-troubleshooting).

#### App status details for iOS apps<!-- 3761235   -->

- Failure to install system apps with MDM provider
- Failure to install apps when device is in lost mode or kiosk mode
- Failure to install app when user is not signed in to the App Store

In Intune, select **Client apps** > **Apps** > "App name" > **Device install status**. New error messages will be available in the **Status details** column.

#### New App categories screen in the Company Portal app for Windows 10<!-- 3834780  -->
A new screen called **App categories** has been added to improve the app browsing and selection experience in Company Portal for Windows 10. Users will now see their apps sorted under categories such as **Featured**, **Education**, and **Productivity**. This change appears in Company Portal versions 10.3.3451.0 and later. To view the new screen, see [What's new in the app UI](whats-new-app-ui.md). For more information about apps in the Company Portal, see [Install and share apps on your device](../user-help/install-apps-cpapp-windows.md).

#### Use Microsoft-recommended settings with Security Baselines (Public Preview)<!-- 2055484   -->

Intune integrates with other services that focus on security, including Windows Defender for Endpoint and Office 365 Defender for Endpoint. Customers are asking for a common strategy and a cohesive set of end-to-end security workflows across the Microsoft 365 services. Our goal is to align strategies to build solutions that bridge security operations and common administrator tasks. 
In Intune, we aim to accomplish this goal by publishing a set of Microsoft recommended "Security baselines" (**Intune** > **Security baselines**).  An administrator can create security policies directly from these baselines, and then deploy them to their users. You can also customize the best practice recommendations to meet the needs of your organization. Intune makes sure that devices stay in compliance with these baselines, and notifies administrators of users or devices that aren't in compliance.

This feature is in public preview so any profiles created now will not move over to security baseline templates that are generally available (GA). You shouldn't plan to use these preview templates in your production environment.

To learn more about security baselines, see [Create a Windows 10 security baseline in Intune](../protect/security-baselines-monitor.md).

This feature applies to:
Windows 10 and later

When you enable BitLocker settings on Windows 10 devices (**Devices** > **Configuration** > **Create** > **Windows 10 and later** for platform > **Endpoint protection** for profile type > **Windows Encryption**), you add BitLocker settings.

This update includes a new BitLocker setting to allow standard users (non-administrators) to enable encryption.

To see the settings, go to [Endpoint protection settings for Windows 10](../protect/endpoint-protection-windows-10.md#windows-encryption).

#### Check for Configuration Manager compliance<!-- 2192052  eepublished  -->
This update includes a new Configuration Manager compliance setting (**Device compliance** > **Policies** > **Create policy** > **Windows 10 and later** > **Configuration Manager Compliance**). Configuration Manager sends signals to Intune compliance. Using this setting, you can require all Configuration Manager signals to return **compliant**.

For example, you require all software updates to be installed on devices. In Configuration Manager, this requirement has the "Installed" state. If any programs on the device are in unknown state, then the device is noncompliant in Intune.

[Configuration Manager Compliance](../protect/compliance-policy-create-windows.md#configuration-manager-compliance) describes this setting.

Applies to: 
Windows 10 and later

#### Customize wallpaper on supervised iOS devices using a device configuration profile<!-- 2809324   -->
When you create a device configuration profile for iOS devices, you can customize some features (**Devices** > **Configuration** > **Create** > **iOS** for platform > **Device features** for profile type).

### Device Management
#### Preview of support for Android corporate-owned, fully managed devices<!-- 1574342  -->
Intune now supports fully managed Android devices, a corporate-owned "device owner" scenario where devices are tightly managed by IT and are affiliated with individual users. This feature allows admins to manage the entire device, enforce an extended range of policy controls unavailable to work profiles, and restricts users to installing apps from managed Google Play only. For more information, see [Set up Intune enrollment of Android fully managed devices](../enrollment/android-fully-managed-enroll.md) and [Enroll your dedicated devices or fully managed devices](../enrollment/android-dedicated-devices-fully-managed-enroll.md).

This feature is in preview. Some Intune capabilities, such as certificates, compliance, and Conditional Access, are not currently available with Android fully managed user devices.

#### Selective wipe support for WIP Without Enrollment devices<!-- 1434452 -->
Windows Information Protection Without Enrollment (WIP-WE) allows customers to protect their corporate data on Windows 10 devices without the need for full MDM enrollment. Once documents are protected with a WIP-WE policy, the protected data can be selectively wiped by an Intune administrator. By selecting the user and device, and sending a wipe request, all data that was protected via the WIP-WE policy will become unusable. From the Intune in the Azure portal, select **Mobile app** > **App selective wipe**.


<!-- vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv -->
### Monitor and troubleshoot

#### Tenant Status dashboard<!-- 1124854 -->
The new [Tenant Status page](tenant-status.md) provides a single location where you can view status and related details for your tenant.  The dashboard is divided into four areas:
- **Tenant Details** - Displays information that includes your Tenant name and location, your MDM Authority, the total enrolled devices in your tenant, and your license counts. This section also lists the current service release for your tenant.
- **Connector Status** - Displays information about available connectors you have configured and can also list the connectors that aren't enabled yet.  
   Based on the current state of each connector,  they are flagged as Healthy, Warning, or Unhealthy. Select a connector to drill through and view details or configure more information for it.
- **Intune Service Health** - Displays details about active incidents or outages for your tenant. The information in this section is retrieved directly from the Office Message Center.
- **Intune News** - Displays active messages for your tenant. Messages include things like notifications when your tenant receives the latest Intune features.  The information in this section is retrieved directly from the Office Message Center.

#### New help and support experience in Company Portal for Windows 10<!-- 1488939-->
The new Company Portal Help & support page helps users troubleshoot and request help for app and access problems. From the new page, they can email error and diagnostic log details and find their organization's Helpdesk details. They'll also find a FAQ section with links to the relevant Intune documentation.

#### New Help and Support experience for Intune<!-- #3307080 -->
We are rolling out the new Help and Support experience to all tenants over the next few days. This new experience is available for Intune and can be accessed when using the Intune blades in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
The new experience lets you describe your problem in your own words and receive troubleshooting insight and web-based remediation content. These solutions are offered via a rule-based machine learning algorithm, driven by user inquires.
In addition to issue-specific guidance, you use the new case creation workflow to open a support case by email or phone. 

This new experience replaces the previous Help and Support experience. It was a static set of pre-selected options that are based on the area of the console you're in when you open Help and Support.

For more information, see [How to get support for Microsoft Intune](../../get-support.md).

#### New operational logs, and ability to send logs to Azure Monitor services<!-- 3762211  -->
Intune has built-in audit logging that tracks events as changes are made. This update includes new logging features, including: 
- Operational logs (preview) that show details on users and devices that enrolled, including success and failed attempts.
- The audit logs and operational logs can be sent to Azure Monitor, including storage accounts, event hubs, and log analytics. These services allow you to store, use analytics such as Splunk and QRadar, and get visualizations of your logging data.

[Send log data to storage, event hubs, or log analytics in Intune](review-logs-using-azure-monitor.md) provides more information on this feature.

#### Skip more Setup Assistant screens on an iOS DEP device<!-- 2687509  -->
In addition to the screens you can currently skip, you can set iOS DEP devices to skip the following screens in the Setup Assistant when a user enrolls the device: Display Tone, Privacy, Android Migration, Home Button, iMessage & FaceTime, Onboarding, Watch Migration, Appearance, Screen Time, Software Update, SIM Setup.
To choose which screens to skip, go to **Device enrollment** > **Apple enrollment** > **Enrollment program tokens** > choose a token > **Profiles** > choose a profile > **Properties** > **Setup Assistant customization** > choose **Hide** for any screens that you want to skip > **OK**.
If you create a new profile or edit a profile, the selected skip screens need to sync with the Apple MDM server. Users can issue a manual sync of the devices so that there is no delay in picking up the profile changes.

#### Android Enterprise APP-WE app deployment<!-- 1171203 -->
For Android devices in a non-enrolled App Protection Policy Without Enrollment (APP-WE) deployment scenario, you can now use managed Google Play to deploy store apps and LOB apps to users. Specifically, you can provide end users with an app catalog and installation experience that no longer requires end users to loosen the security posture of their devices by allowing installations from unknown sources. In addition, this deployment scenario will provide an improved end user experience.

<!-- vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv -->
### Role-based access control

#### Scope tags for apps<!-- 1081941 -->
You can create scope tags to limit access for roles and apps. You can add a scope tag to an app so that only people with roles also assigned that scope tag have access to the app. Currently, apps added to Intune from managed Google Play or apps purchased using Apple Volume Purchase Program (VPP) can't be assigned scope tags (future support is planned). For more information, see [Use scope tags to filter policies](scope-tags.md).

#### Require non-biometric PIN after a specified timeout<!-- 1506985 -->
By requiring a non-biometric PIN after an admin-specified timeout, Intune provides improved security for Mobile Application Management (MAM) enabled apps by restricting the use of biometric identification for access to corporate data. The settings affect users who rely on Touch ID (iOS), Face ID (iOS), Android Biometric, or other future biometric authentication methods to access their APP/MAM-enabled applications. These settings enable Intune admins to have more granular control over user access, eliminating cases where a device with multiple fingerprints or other biometric access methods can reveal corporate data to an incorrect user. In the Azure portal, open **Microsoft Intune**. Select **Client apps** > **App protection policies** > **Add a policy** > **Settings**. Locate the **Access** section for specific settings. For information about access settings, see [iOS settings](../apps/app-protection-policy-settings-ios.md#access-requirements) and [Android settings](../apps/app-protection-policy-settings-android.md#access-requirements).

#### Intune APP data transfer settings on iOS MDM enrolled devices<!-- 2244713 -->
You can separate the control of Intune APP data transfer settings on iOS MDM enrolled devices from specifying the enrolled user's identity, also known as the User Principal Name (UPN). Admins not using the IntuneMAMUPN will not observe a behavior change. When this functionality is available, admins using the IntuneMAMUPN to control data transfer behavior on enrolled devices should review the new settings and update their APP settings as needed.

#### Windows 10 Win32 apps<!-- 2617325 -->
You can configure your Win32 apps to be installed in user context for individual users, versus installing the app for all users of the device.

With this update, you can also enter multiple **DNS suffixes** in Intune. When using DNS suffixes, you can search for a network resource using its short name, instead of the fully qualified domain name (FQDN). This update also lets you change the order of the DNS suffixes in Intune.
[Windows 10 VPN settings](../configuration/vpn-settings-windows-10.md#dns-settings) lists the current DNS settings.
Applies to: Windows 10 devices

#### Support for always-on VPN for Android enterprise work profiles<!-- 1333705 -->
In this update, you can use Always-on VPN connections on Android enterprise devices with managed work profiles. Always-on VPN connections stay connected, or immediately reconnect when the user unlocks their device, when the device restarts, or when the wireless network changes. You can also put the connection in "lockdown" mode, which blocks all network traffic until the VPN connection is active.
You can enable Always-on VPN in **Devices** > **Configuration** > **Create** > **Android enterprise** for platform > **Device restrictions** > **Connectivity** settings.

#### Issue SCEP certificates to user-less devices<!-- 1744554 -->
Currently, certificates are issued to users. With this update, SCEP certificates can be issued to devices, including user-less devices such as kiosks (**Devices** > **Configuration** > **Create** > **Windows 10 and later** for platform > **SCEP certificate** for profile). 
Other updates include:
- The **Subject** property in an SCEP profile is now a custom textbox and can include new variables. 
- The **Subject alternative name (SAN)** property in an SCEP profile is now a table format and can include new variables. In the table, an admin can add an attribute and fill out the value in a custom textbox. The SAN will support the following attributes: 
  - DNS
  - Email address
  - UPN

  These new variables can be added with static text in a custom value textbox. For example, the DNS attribute can be added as `DNS = {{AzureADDeviceId}}.domain.com`.

  > [!NOTE]
  > Curly brackets, semicolons, and pipe symbols " { } ; | " will not work in the static text of the SAN. Curly brackets must only enclose one of the new device certificate variables to be accepted for either `Subject` or `Subject alternative name`. 

New device certificate variables:  

```
"{{AAD_Device_ID}}",
"{{Device_Serial}}",
"{{Device_IMEI}}",
"{{SerialNumber}}",
"{{IMEINumber}}",
"{{AzureADDeviceId}}",
"{{WiFiMacAddress}}",
"{{IMEI}}",
"{{DeviceName}}",
"{{FullyQualifiedDomainName}}",
"{{MEID}}",
```

> [!NOTE]
> - `{{FullyQualifiedDomainName}}` only works for Windows and domain-joined devices. 
> - When specifying device properties such as IMEI, Serial Number, and Fully Qualified Domain Name in the subject or SAN for a device certificate, be aware that these properties could be spoofed by a person with access to the device.

- Currently, you can create multiple kiosk profiles on the same device. With this update, Intune will support only one kiosk profile per device. If you still need multiple kiosk profiles on a single device, you can use a Custom URI.
- In a **Multi-app kiosk** profile, you can select the application tile size and order for the **Start menu layout** in the application grid. If you prefer more customization, you can continue to upload an XML file.
- The Kiosk Browser settings are moving into the **Kiosk** settings. Currently, the **Kiosk web browser** settings have their own category in the Azure portal.
Applies to: Windows 10 and later

#### PIN prompt when you change fingerprints or face ID on an iOS device <!-- 2637704  -->
Users are now prompted for a PIN after making biometric changes on their iOS device. This feature includes changes to registered fingerprints or face ID. The timing of the prompt depends on how the configuration of the *Recheck access requirements after (minutes)* timeout.  When no PIN is set, the user is prompted to set one. 
 
This feature is only available for iOS, and requires the participation of applications that integrate the Intune APP SDK for iOS, version 9.0.1 or later. Integration of the SDK is necessary so that the behavior can be enforced on the targeted applications. This integration happens on a rolling basis and is dependent on the specific application teams. Some apps that participate include WXP, Outlook, Managed Browser, and Viva Engage.

#### Network access control support on iOS VPN clients<!-- 1333693 -->
With this update, there's a new setting to enable Network Access Control (NAC) when you create a VPN configuration profile for Cisco AnyConnect, F5 Access, and Citrix SSO for iOS. This setting allows the NAC ID of the device to be included in the VPN profile. Currently, there aren't any VPN clients or NAC partner solutions that support this new NAC ID. We will keep you informed through our [support blog post](https://aka.ms/iOS12_and_vpn) when they do.

To use NAC, you'll need to:
1. Opt in to allow Intune to include device IDs in VPN profiles
2. Update your NAC provider software/firmware, using guidance directly from your NAC provider

For information on this setting within an iOS VPN profile, see [Add VPN settings on iOS devices in Microsoft Intune](../configuration/vpn-settings-ios.md). For more information on network access control, see [Network access control (NAC) integration with Intune](../protect/network-access-control-integrate.md).

For more information, see [Windows Autopilot for existing devices](/autopilot/enrollment-autopilot#windows-autopilot-for-existing-devices).

#### Intune app protection policies<!-- 2984657 -->
Intune app protection policies allow you to configure various data protection settings for Intune protected apps, such as Microsoft Outlook and Microsoft Word. We've change the look and feel of these settings for both [iOS](../apps/app-protection-policy-settings-ios.md) and [Android](../apps/app-protection-policy-settings-android.md) to make it easier to find individual settings. There are three categories of policy settings:
- **Data relocation** - This group includes the data loss prevention (DLP) controls, like cut, copy, paste, and save-as restrictions. These settings determine how users interact with data in the apps.
- **Access requirements** - This group contains the per-app PIN options that determine how the end user accesses the apps in a work context.  
- **Conditional launch** - This group holds settings like the minimum OS settings, jailbreak and rooted device detection, and offline grace periods.  
  
The functionality of the settings doesn't change, but it will be easier to find them when you work in the policy authoring flow.

#### Restricts apps, and block access to company resources on Android devices<!-- 2451462  -->  
In **Device compliance** > **Policies** > **Create policy** > **Android** > **System Security**, there is a new setting under the *Device Security* section, named **Restricted apps**.

### App management

#### Line-of-business (LOB) app support for macOS<!-- 1895847 -->
Microsoft Intune allows macOS LOB apps to be deployed as **Required** or **Available with enrollment**. End users can get apps deployed as **Available** using the Company Portal for macOS or the [Company Portal website](https://portal.manage.microsoft.com).

#### iOS built-in app support for kiosk mode<!-- 2051098 -->
In addition to Store Apps and Managed Apps, you can now select a Built-In App (such as Safari) that runs in kiosk mode on an iOS device.

#### Edit your Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise app deployments<!-- 2150145 -->
As the Microsoft Intune admin, you have greater ability to edit your Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise app deployments. Also, you no longer have to delete your deployments to change any of the suite's properties. In the Azure portal, select **Microsoft Intune** > **Client apps** > **Apps**. From the list of apps, select your Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise suite.  

#### Updated Intune App SDK for Android is now available<!-- 2744271-->
An updated version of the Intune App SDK for Android is available to support the Android P release. If you're an app developer and use the Intune SDK for Android, you must install the updated version of the Intune app SDK to ensure that Intune functionality within your Android apps continue to work as expected on Android P devices. This version of the Intune App SDK provides a built-in plugin that performs the SDK updates. You don't need to rewrite any existing code that's integrated. For details, see [Intune SDK for Android](https://github.com/msintuneappsdk/ms-intune-app-sdk-android). If you're using the old badging style for Intune, we recommend that you use the briefcase icon. For branding details, see [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/msintuneappsdk/intune-app-partner-badge).

#### More opportunities to sync in the Company portal app for Windows  
The Company Portal app for Windows now lets you initiate a sync directly from the Windows taskbar and Start menu. This feature is especially useful if your only task is to sync devices and get access to corporate resources. To access the new feature, right-click the Company portal icon that's pinned to your taskbar or Start menu. In the menu options (also referred to as a jump list), select **Sync this device**. The Company Portal will open to the **Settings** page and initiate your sync. For a look at the new functionality, see [What's new in the UI](whats-new-app-ui.md).

#### New browsing experiences in the Company portal app for Windows  
Now when browsing or searching for apps in the Company Portal app for Windows, you can toggle between the existing **Tiles** view and the newly added **Details** view. The new view lists application details such as name, publisher, publication date and installation status.  

The **Apps** page's **Installed** view lets you see details about completed and in-progress app installations. To see what the new view looks like, see [What's new in the UI](whats-new-app-ui.md).  

#### Improved Company Portal app experience for device enrollment managers  
When a device enrollment manager (DEM) signs in to the Company Portal app for Windows, the app will now only list the DEM's current, running device. This improvement will reduce timeouts that previously occurred when the app tried to show all DEM-enrolled devices.  

#### Block app access based on unapproved device vendors and models <!-- 1425689 ! -->
The Intune IT admin can enforce a specified list of Android manufacturers, and/or iOS models through Intune App Protection Policies. The IT admin can provide a semicolon separated list of manufacturers for Android policies and device models for iOS policies. Intune App Protection Policies are for Android and iOS only. There are two separate actions that can be performed on this specified list:
- A block from app access on devices that are not specified.
- Or, a selective wipe of corporate data on devices that are not specified. 

The user will be unable to access the targeted application if the requirements through the policy are not met. Based on settings, the user might either be blocked, or selectively wiped of their corporate data within the app. On iOS devices, this feature requires the participation of applications (such as WXP, Outlook, Managed Browser, Viva Engage) to integrate the Intune APP SDK for this feature to be enforced with the targeted applications. This integration happens on a rolling basis and is dependent on the specific application teams. On Android, this feature requires the latest Company Portal. 

On end-user devices, the Intune client will take action based on a simple matching of the strings specified in the Intune blade for Application Protection Policies. This behavior depends entirely on the value that the device reports. As such, the IT administrator is encouraged to ensure that the intended behavior is accurate. To check accuracy, test this setting based on different device manufacturers and models targeted to a small user group. In Microsoft Intune, select **Client apps** > **App protection policies** to view and add app protection policies. For more information about app protection policies, see [What are app protection policies](../apps/app-protection-policy.md) and [Selectively wipe data using app protection policy access actions](../apps/app-protection-policies-access-actions.md).

#### Access to macOS Company Portal pre-release build<!-- 1734766 -->
Using Microsoft AutoUpdate, you can sign up to receive builds early by joining the Insider program. Signing up will enable you to use the updated Company Portal before it's available to your end users. For more information, see the [Microsoft Intune blog](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/intunesupport/2018/07/13/use-microsoft-autoupdate-for-early-access-to-the-macos-company-portal-app/).

### Intune apps

#### Improved troubleshooting for app installation<!-- 928990 -->
On Microsoft Intune MDM-managed devices, sometimes app installations can fail. When these app installs fail, it can be challenging to understand the failure reason or troubleshoot the issue. We're shipping a Public Preview of our App Troubleshooting features. You will notice a new node under each individual device called **Managed Apps**. This node lists the apps that have been delivered via Intune MDM. Inside the node, there's a list of app install states. If you select an individual app, there's the troubleshooting view for that specific app. In the troubleshooting view, you see the end-to-end lifecycle of the app, such as when the app was created, modified, targeted, and delivered to a device. Also, if the app install was not successful, you'll be presented with the error code and a helpful message about the cause of the error. 

#### Intune app protection policies and Microsoft Edge<!-- 1818968 -->
The Microsoft Edge browser for mobile devices (iOS and Android) now supports Microsoft Intune app protection policies. Users of iOS and Android devices who sign in with their corporate Microsoft Entra accounts in the Microsoft Edge application will be protected by Intune.

### App management

#### Configuring your app protection policies<!-- 2144597 Part 2 -->

In the Azure portal, instead of going to the Intune App Protection service blade, you now just go to Intune. There is now only one location for app protection policies within Intune. All of your app protection policies are on the **Mobile app** blade in Intune under **App protection policies**. This integration helps to simplify your cloud management administration. Remember, all app protection policies are already in Intune and you can modify any of your previously configured policies. Intune App Policy Protection (APP) and Conditional Access (CA) policies are now under **Conditional Access**, which can be found under the **Manage** section in the **Microsoft Intune** blade or under the **Security** section in the **Microsoft Entra ID** blade. For more information about modifying Conditional Access policies, see [Conditional Access in Microsoft Entra ID](/azure/active-directory/active-directory-conditional-access-azure-portal). For more information, see [What are app protection policies?](../apps/app-protection-policy.md)

<!-- ########################## -->
## April 2018

### App management

#### Passcode support for MAM PIN on Android<!-- 1438086 -->

Intune admins can set an application launch requirement to enforce a passcode instead of a numeric MAM PIN. If configured, the user is required to set and use a passcode when prompted before getting access to MAM-enlightened applications. A passcode is defined as a numeric PIN with at least one special character or upper/lowercase alphabet. Intune supports passcode in a similar way to the existing numeric PIN... being able to set a minimum length, allowing repeat characters and sequences through the Intune admin center. This feature requires the latest version of Company Portal on Android. This feature is already available for iOS.

#### Line-of-business (LOB) app support for macOS<!-- 1473977 -->
Microsoft Intune will provide the capability to install macOS LOB apps from the Azure portal. You can add a macOS LOB app to Intune after it has been pre-processed by the tool available in GitHub.

#### Intune will reinstall required apps that are uninstalled by users<!-- 1947010 -->
If an end user uninstalls a required app, Intune automatically reinstalls the app within 24 hours rather than waiting for the 7-day re-evaluation cycle.

#### Update where to configure your app protection policies<!-- 2144597 -->

In the Azure portal within the Microsoft Intune service, we're going to temporarily redirect you from the **Intune App Protection** service blade to the **Mobile app** blade. All of your app protection policies are already on the **Mobile app** blade in Intune under app configuration. Instead of going to Intune App Protection, you'll just go to Intune. In April 2018, we will stop the redirection and fully remove the **Intune App Protection** service blade, so that there's only one location for app protection policies within Intune. 

**How does this affect me?**
This change will affect both Intune standalone customers and hybrid (Intune with Configuration Manager) customers. This integration will help simplify your cloud management administration.

**What do I need to do to prepare for this change?**
Tag **Intune** as a favorite instead of the **Intune App Protection** service blade and ensure you're familiar with the App protection policy workflow in the **Mobile** app blade within Intune. We'll redirect for a short period of time and then remove the **App Protection** blade. Remember, all app protection policies are already in Intune and you can modify any of your Conditional Access policies. For more information about modifying Conditional Access policies, see [Conditional Access in Microsoft Entra ID](/azure/active-directory/active-directory-conditional-access-azure-portal). For more information, see [What are app protection policies?](../apps/app-protection-policy.md) 

### Device configuration

#### Device profile chart and status list show all devices in a group<!-- 1449153 -->
When you configure a device profile (**Devices** > **Configuration**), you choose the device profile, such as iOS. You assign this profile to a group that includes iOS devices and non-iOS devices. The graphical chart count shows that the profile is applied to the iOS *and* the non-iOS devices (**Devices** > **Configuration** > select an existing profile > **Overview**). When you select the graphical chart in the **Overview** tab, the **Device status** lists all the devices in the group, instead of only the iOS devices. 

With this update, the graphical chart (**Devices** > **Configuration** > select an existing profile > **Overview**) only shows the count for the specific device profile. For example, if the configuration device profile applies to iOS devices, the chart only lists the count of the iOS devices. Selecting the graphical chart, and opening the **Device status** only lists the iOS devices.

While this update is being made, the graphical user chart is temporarily removed. 

#### Always On VPN for Windows 10<!--1333666 -->

Currently, [Always On](/windows/security/identity-protection/vpn/vpn-auto-trigger-profile#always-on) can be used on Windows 10 devices by using a custom virtual private network (VPN) profile created using OMA-URI.

With this update, admins can enable Always On for Windows 10 VPN profiles directly in Intune in the Azure portal. Always On VPN profiles will automatically connect when:

- Users sign into their devices
- The network on the device changes
- The screen on the device turns back on after being turned off

#### New printer settings for education profiles<!-- 1308900 -->

For education profiles, new settings are available under the **Printers** category: **Printers**, **Default printer**, **Add new printers**.

#### Show caller ID in personal profile - Android Enterprise work profile<!--1098984 -->
When using a personal profile on a device, end users might not see the caller ID details from a work contact. 

With this update, there is a new setting in **Android Enterprise** > **Device restrictions** > **Work profile settings**:
- Display work contact caller-id in personal profile

When enabled (not configured), the work contact caller details are displayed in the personal profile. When blocked, the work contact caller number isn't displayed in the personal profile. 

Applies to: Android work profile devices on Android OS v6.0 and newer

#### New Windows Defender Credential Guard settings added to endpoint protection settings<!--1102252 --><!--from 1802 and 1804-->

With this update, [Windows Defender Credential Guard](/windows/access-protection/credential-guard/credential-guard) (**Devices** > **Configuration** > **Endpoint protection**) includes the following settings: 

- **Windows Defender Credential Guard**: Turns on Credential Guard with virtualization-based security. Enabling this feature helps protect credentials at the next reboot when **Platform Security Level with Secure Boot** and **Virtualization Based Security** are both enabled. Options include:
  - **Disabled**: If Credential Guard was previously turned on with the **Enabled without lock**" option, then it turns off Credential Guard remotely.

  - **Enabled with UEFI lock**: Ensures that Credential Guard cannot be disabled using a registry key or using Group Policy. To disable Credential Guard after using this setting, you must set the Group Policy to **Disabled**. Then, remove the security functionality from each computer, with a physically present user. These steps clear the configuration persisted in UEFI. As long as the UEFI configuration persists, Credential Guard is enabled.

  - **Enabled without lock**: Allows Credential Guard to be disabled remotely using Group Policy. The devices that use this setting must be running at least Windows 10 (Version 1511).

The following dependent technologies are automatically enabled when configuring Credential Guard: 

- **Enable Virtualization-based Security (VBS)**: Turns on virtualization-based security (VBS) at next reboot. Virtualization-based security uses the Windows Hypervisor to provide support for security services, and requires Secure Boot.
- **Secure Boot with Direct Memory Access (DMA)**: Turns on VBS with Secure Boot and direct memory access. DMA protection requires hardware support, and is only enabled on properly configured devices. 

#### Use a custom subject name on SCEP certificate<!-- 2064190 -->
You can use the **OnPremisesSamAccountName** the common name in a custom subject on an SCEP certificate profile. For example, you can use `CN={OnPremisesSamAccountName})`.

#### Block camera and screen captures on Android Enterprise work profiles<!-- 1098977 -->
Two new properties are available to block when you configure device restrictions for Android devices: 
- Camera: Blocks access to all cameras on the device
- Screen capture: Blocks the screen capture, and also prevents the content from being shown on display devices that don't have a secure video output

Applies to Android Enterprise work profiles.

#### Use Cisco AnyConnect client for iOS<!-- 1333708 -->

When you create a new VPN profile for iOS, there are now two options: **Cisco AnyConnect** and **Cisco Legacy AnyConnect**. Cisco AnyConnect profiles support 4.0.7x and newer versions. Existing iOS Cisco AnyConnect VPN profiles are labeled **Cisco Legacy AnyConnect**, and continue to work with Cisco AnyConnect 4.0.5x and older versions, as they do today.

> [!NOTE]
> This change only applies to iOS. There continues to be only one Cisco AnyConnect option for Android, Android Enterprise work profiles, and macOS platforms.


### Device enrollment

#### New enrollment steps for users on devices with macOS High Sierra 10.13.2+<!--1734567 -->
macOS high Sierra 10.13.2 introduced the concept of "User Approved" MDM enrollment. Approved enrollments allow Intune to manage some security-sensitive settings. For more information, see Apple's support documentation here: https://support.apple.com/HT208019.

Devices enrolled using the macOS Company Portal are considered "Not User Approved" unless the end user opens System Preferences and manually provides approval. To this end, the macOS Company Portal now directs users on macOS 10.13.2 and later to go and manually approve their enrollment at the end of the enrollment process. The Intune admin center will report on if an enrolled device is user approved.

#### Jamf-enrolled macOS devices can now register with Intune<!-- 2370684 -->
Versions 1.3 and 1.4 of the macOS company portal did not successfully register Jamf devices with Intune. Version 1.4.2 of the macOS portal fixes this issue.

#### Updated help experience in Company Portal app for Android<!-- 1631531 -->
We've updated the help experience in the Company Portal app for Android to align with best practices for the Android platform. Now when users encounter a problem in the app, they can tap **Menu** > **Help** and:
- Upload diagnostic logs to Microsoft.
- Send an email that describes the problem and incident ID to a company support person.  

To check out the updated help experience, see [Report a problem in Company Portal or Intune app for Android](../user-help/send-logs-to-your-it-admin-by-email-android.md).  


#### New enrollment failure trend chart and failure reasons table<!-- 1471783 -->
On the Enrollment Overview page, you can view the trend of enrollment failures and the top five causes of failures. By selecting on the chart or table, you can drill into details to find troubleshooting advice and remediation suggestions.


### Device management

#### Defender for Endpoint and Intune are fully integrated<!-- 1629303 -->

[Defender for Endpoint](/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-defender-atp/dashboard-windows-defender-advanced-threat-protection) shows the risk level of Windows 10 devices. In Windows Defender Security Center, you can create a connection to Microsoft Intune. Once created, an Intune compliance policy is used to determine an acceptable threat level. If the threat level is exceeded, a Microsoft Entra Conditional Access policy can then block access to different apps within your organization.

This feature allows Defender for Endpoint to scan files, detect threats, and report any risk on your Windows 10 devices.

See [Enable Defender for Endpoint with Conditional Access in Intune](../protect/advanced-threat-protection.md).

#### Support for user-less devices<!-- 1637553 -->
Intune supports the ability to evaluate compliance on a user-less device, such as the Microsoft Surface Hub. Compliance policy can target specific devices. So compliance (and noncompliance) can be determined for devices that don't have an associated user.

#### Delete Autopilot devices<!-- 1713650 -->
Intune admins can [delete Autopilot devices](/autopilot/add-devices#delete-autopilot-devices).

#### Improved device deletion experience<!--1832333 -->
You're no longer be required to remove company data or factory reset a device before [deleting a device from Intune](../remote-actions/devices-wipe.md#delete-devices-from-the-intune-admin-center).

To see the new experience, sign in to Intune and select **Devices** > **All devices** > the name of the device > **Delete**.

If you still want the wipe/retire confirmation, you can use the standard device lifecycle route by issuing a **Remove company data** and **Factory Reset** prior to **Delete**. 

#### Play sounds on iOS when in Lost mode<!-- 1947769 -->
When supervised iOS devices are in Mobile Device Management (MDM) [Lost mode](../remote-actions/device-lost-mode.md), you can [play a sound](../remote-actions/device-locate.md#activate-lost-device-sound-alert) (**Devices** > **All devices** > select an iOS device > **Overview** > **More**). The sound continues to play until the device is removed from Lost mode, or a user disables sound on the device. Applies to iOS devices 9.3 and newer.

#### Block or allow web results in searches made on an Intune device<!--1972804-->

Admins can now block web results from searches made on a device.

#### Improved error messaging for Apple MDM Push Certificate upload failure<!-- 2172331 -->

The error message explains that the same Apple ID must be used when renewing an existing MDM certificate.

#### Test the Company Portal for macOS on virtual machines<!-- 2216679 -->

We've published guidance to help IT admins test the Company Portal app for macOS on virtual machines in Parallels Desktop and VMware Fusion. Find out more in [enroll virtual macOS machines for testing](../enrollment/macos-enroll.md#enroll-virtual-macos-machines-for-testing).

### Intune apps

#### User experience update for the Company Portal app for iOS<!--1412866 -->
We've released a major user experience update to the Company Portal app for iOS. The update features a complete visual redesign that includes a modernized look and feel. We've maintained the functionality of the app, but increased its usability and accessibility.  

You'll also see:
- Support for iPhone X.
- Faster app launch and loading responses, to save users time.
- More progress bars to provide users with the most up-to-date status information.
- Improvements to the way users upload logs, so if something goes wrong, it's easier to report.  

To see the updated look, go to [What's new in the app UI](whats-new-app-ui.md).

#### Protect on-premises Exchange data using Intune APP and CA<!-- 1056954 -->
You can now use Intune App Policy Protection (APP) and Conditional Access (CA) to protect access to on-premises Exchange data with Outlook Mobile. To add or modify an app protection policy within the Azure portal, select **Microsoft Intune** > **Client apps** > **App protection policies**. Before using this feature, make sure you meet the [Outlook for iOS and Android requirements](/Exchange/clients/outlook-for-ios-and-android/use-hybrid-modern-auth?view=exchserver-2019&preserve-view=true).


### User interface

#### Improved device tiles in the Windows 10 Company Portal<!--2213364 -->

The tiles have been updated to be more accessible to low-vision users and to perform better for screen reading tools.

#### Send diagnostic reports in Company Portal app for macOS<!-- 2216677 -->
The Company Portal app for macOS devices was updated to improve how users report Intune-related errors. From the Company Portal app, your employees can:

- Upload diagnostic reports directly to the Microsoft developer team.
- Email an incident ID to your company's IT support team.

For more information, see [Send errors for macOS](../user-help/send-errors-macos.md).

#### Intune adapts to Fluent Design System in the Company Portal app for Windows 10<!-- 1195010 -->
The Intune Company Portal app for Windows 10 has been updated with the [Fluent Design System's navigation view](/windows/uwp/design/basics/navigation-basics). Along the side of the app, you'll notice a static, vertical list of all top-level pages. Select any link to quickly view and switch between pages. This feature is the first of several updates that are part of an ongoing effort to create a more adaptive, empathetic, and familiar experience in Intune. To see the updated look, go to [What's new in the app UI](whats-new-app-ui.md).

<!-- ########################## -->
## March 2018

### App management

#### Alerts for expiring iOS line-of-business (LOB) apps for Microsoft Intune<!-- 748789 -->

In the Azure portal, Intune alerts you to iOS line-of-business apps that are about to expire. Upon uploading a new version of the iOS line-of-business app, Intune removes the expiration notification from the app list. This expiration notification will only be active for newly uploaded iOS line-of-business apps. A warning appears 30 days before the iOS LOB app provisioning profile expires. When it expires, the alert changes to Expired.

#### Customize your Company Portal themes with hex codes<!--1049561 -->

You can customize theme color in the Company Portal apps using hex codes. When you enter your hex code, Intune determines the text color that provides the highest level of contrast between the text color and the background color. You can preview both the text color and your company logo against the color in **Client apps** > **Company Portal**.

### Including and excluding app assignment based on groups for Android Enterprise<!-- 1813081 -->

Android Enterprise (formerly known as Android for Work) supports including and excluding groups, but does not support the pre-created **All Users** and **All Devices** built-in groups. For more information, see [Include and exclude app assignments in Microsoft Intune](../apps/apps-inc-exl-assignments.md).


### Device management

### Export all devices into CSV files in IE, Microsoft Edge, or Chrome<!-- 2258071 -->
In **Devices** > **All devices**, you can **Export** the devices into a CSV formatted list. Internet Explorer (IE) users with >10,000 devices can successfully export their devices into multiple files. Each file has up to 10,000 devices.

Microsoft Edge and Chrome users with >30,000 devices can successfully export their devices into multiple files. Each file has up to 30,000 devices.

[Manage devices](../remote-actions/device-management.md) provides more details on what you can do with devices you manage.

#### New security enhancements in the Intune service <!-- 1637539 -->   

We've introduced a toggle in Intune on Azure that Intune standalone customers can use to treat devices without any policy assigned as **Compliant** (security feature off) or treat these devices as **Not compliant** (security feature on). This feature will ensure access to resources only after device compliance has been evaluated.

This feature affects you differently depending on whether you already have compliance policies assigned or not.

- If you're a new or existing account, and don't have any compliance policies assigned to your devices, then the toggle is automatically set to **Compliant**. The feature is off as a default setting in the console. There is no end-user impact.
- If you're an existing account, and you have any devices with a compliance policy assigned to them, then the toggle is automatically set to **Not compliant**. The feature is on as a default setting, as the March update rolls out.

If you use compliance policies with Conditional Access (CA), and have the feature turned on, any devices without at least one compliance policy assigned are blocked by CA. End-users associated with these devices, who were previously allowed access to email, lose their access unless you assign at least one compliance policy to all devices.   

Although the default toggle status is displayed in the UI immediately with the Intune service March updates, this toggle status isn't enforced right away. Any changes you make to the toggle will not affect device compliance until we flight your account to have a working toggle. We'll inform you via the Message center when we finish flighting your account. The flighting can take a few days after your Intune service is updated for March.

For more information, go to [https://aka.ms/compliance_policies](https://aka.ms/compliance_policies).

#### Enhanced jailbreak detection<!-- 846515 -->

Enhanced jailbreak detection is a new compliance setting that improves how Intune evaluates jailbroken devices. The setting causes the device to check in with Intune more frequently, which uses the device's location services and affects battery usage.

#### Reset passwords for Android O devices<!-- 1238299 -->
You can reset the passwords for enrolled Android 8.0 devices with Work profiles. When you send a "Reset password" request to an Android 8.0 device, it sets a new device unlock password or a managed profile challenge to the current user. The password or challenge is sent and immediately takes effect.

#### Targeting compliance policies to devices in device groups<!--1307012 -->

You can target compliance policies to users in user groups. With this update, you can target compliance policies to devices in device groups. Devices targeted as part of device groups will not receive any compliance actions.

#### New Management name column<!-- 1333586 -->
 A new column named **Management name** is available on the devices blade. This column is an auto-generated, non-editable name assigned per device, based on the following formula:
- Default name for all devices: `&#9001;username&#9002;&#9001;em&#9002;&#9001;devicetype&#9002;&#9001;/em&#9002;&#9001;enrollmenttimestamp&#9002;`
- For bulk added devices: `&#9001;PackageId/ProfileId&#9002;&#9001;em&#9002;&#9001;DeviceType&#9002;&#9001;/em&#9002;&#9001;EnrollmentTime&#9002;`

This column is optional in the devices blade. It isn't available by default and you can only access it by using the column selector. The device name isn't affected by this new column.

#### iOS devices are prompted for a PIN every 15 minutes<!--1550837 -->
After a compliance or configuration policy is applied to an iOS device, users are prompted to set a PIN every 15 minutes. Users are continually prompted until a PIN is set.

#### Schedule your automatic updates<!--1805514 -->
Intune gives you control on installing automatic updates using [Windows Update Ring settings](../protect/windows-update-for-business-configure.md). With this update, you can schedule reoccurring updates, including the week, the day, and the time.

#### Use fully distinguished name as subject for SCEP certificate<!--2221763 -->
When you create a SCEP certificate profile, you enter the Subject Name. With this update, you can use the fully distinguished name as the subject. For **Subject Name**,  select **Custom**, and then enter `CN={{OnPrem_Distinguished_Name}}`. To use the `{{OnPrem_Distinguished_Name}}` variable, be sure to sync the `onpremisesdistingishedname` user attribute using [Microsoft Entra Connect](/azure/active-directory/connect/active-directory-aadconnect) to your Microsoft Entra ID.

### Device configuration

#### Enable Bluetooth contact sharing - Android for Work<!--1098983 -->
By default, Android prevents contacts in the work profile from syncing with Bluetooth devices. As a result, work profile contacts are not displayed on caller ID for Bluetooth devices.

With this update, there is a new setting in **Android for Work** > **Device restrictions** > **Work profile settings**:
- Contact sharing via Bluetooth

The Intune administrator can configure these settings to enable sharing. This feature is useful when pairing a device with a car-based Bluetooth device that displays caller ID for hands-free usage. When enabled, work profile contacts are displayed. When not enabled, work profile contacts won't display.

#### Configure Gatekeeper to control macOS app download source<!-- 1690459 -->

You can configure Gatekeeper to protect your devices from apps by controlling where the apps can be downloaded from. You can configure the following download sources: **Mac App Store**, **Mac App Store and identified developers**, or **Anywhere**. You can configure whether users can install an app using control-click to override these Gatekeeper controls.

These settings can be found under **Devices** > **Configuration** > **Create** > **macOS** > **Endpoint protection**.

#### Configure the Mac application firewall<!-- 1690461 -->

You can configure the Mac application firewall. You can use application firewall to control connections on a per-application basis, rather than on a per-port basis. This feature makes it easier to get the benefits of firewall protection, and helps prevent undesirable apps from taking control of network ports open for legitimate apps.

This feature can be found under **Devices** > **Configuration** > **Create** > **macOS** > **Endpoint protection**.

Once you enable the Firewall setting, you can configure the firewall using two strategies:

- Block all incoming connections

   You can block all incoming connections for the targeted devices. If you choose to do this, incoming connections are blocked for all apps.

- Allow or block specific apps

   You can allow or block specific apps from receiving incoming connections. You can also enable stealth mode to prevent responses to probing requests.

#### Detailed error codes and messages<!-- 1376342 -->

In your Device Configuration, there are more detailed error codes and error messages available to see. This improved reporting shows the settings, the state of these settings, and details on troubleshooting.

##### More information

- Block all incoming connections

   This setting blocks all sharing services (such as File Sharing and Screen Sharing) from receiving incoming connections. The system services that are still allowed to receive incoming connections are:
  - configd - implements DHCP and other network configuration services
  - mDNSResponder - implements Bonjour
  - racoon - implements IPSec

    To use sharing services, ensure **Incoming connections** is set to **Not configured** (not **Block**).

- Stealth mode

   Enable this setting to prevent the computer from responding to probing requests. The computer still answers incoming requests for authorized apps. Unexpected requests, such as ICMP (ping), are ignored.

#### Disable checks on device restart<!--1805490 -->
Intune gives you control to [manage software updates](../protect/windows-update-for-business-configure.md). With this update, the <strong>Restart checks</strong> property is available, and enabled by default. To skip the typical checks that occur when you restart a device (such as active users, battery levels, and so on), select <strong>Skip</strong>.

#### New Windows 10 Insider Preview channels available for deployment rings<!-- 1746293 -->
You can now select the following Windows 10 Insider Preview servicing channels when you create a Windows 10 deployment ring:
- Windows Insider build &#8208; Fast
- Windows Insider build &#8208; Slow
- Release Windows Insider build 

For more information about these channels, see [Manage Insider Preview Builds](https://insider.windows.com/en-us/for-business-getting-started/#explore).

### Intune apps

<a name='azure-active-directory-web-sites-can-require-the-intune-managed-browser-app-and-support-single-sign-on-for-the-managed-browser-public-preview---710595---'></a>

### Microsoft Entra web sites can require the Intune Managed Browser app and support single sign-on for the Managed Browser (Public Preview)<!-- 710595 -->

Using Microsoft Entra ID, you can now restrict access to web sites on mobile devices to the Intune Managed Browser app. In the Managed Browser, web site data will remain secure and separate from end-user personal data. In addition, the Managed Browser will support single sign-on capabilities for sites protected by Microsoft Entra ID. Signing in to the Managed Browser, or using the Managed Browser on a device with another app managed by Intune, allows the Managed Browser to access corporate sites protected by Microsoft Entra ID. End users don't have to enter their credentials.

This functionality applies to sites like Outlook Web Access (OWA) and SharePoint Online, and other corporate sites like intranet resources accessed through the Azure App Proxy. For more information, see [Access controls in Microsoft Entra Conditional Access](/azure/active-directory/active-directory-conditional-access-controls).

#### Company Portal app for Android visual updates<!--976944 -->

  - Allows the CPU to offload graphics rendering to the vGPU.
  - Can improve performance when working with graphics intense websites or watching video within the container.

- **SaveFilestoHost**: Administrators can enable files to pass from Microsoft Edge running in the container to the host file system. Turning this setting on allows users to download files from Microsoft Edge in the container to the host file system.

#### MAM protection policies targeted based on management state<!-- 1665993 -->
You can target MAM policies based on the management state of the device:
- **Android devices** - You can target unmanaged devices, Intune managed devices, and Intune managed Android Enterprise Profiles (formerly Android for Work).
- **iOS devices** - You can target unmanaged devices (MAM only) or Intune managed devices.

    > [!NOTE]
    > - iOS support for this functionality is rolling out throughout April 2018.

For more information, see [Target app protection policies based on device management state](../apps/app-protection-policies.md).

#### Improvements to the language in the Company Portal app for Windows<!-- 1683758 -->
We've improved the language in the Company Portal for Windows 10 to be more user-friendly and specific to your company. To see some sample images of what we've done, see [what's new in app UI](whats-new-app-ui.md).

#### New additions to our docs about user privacy<!-- 1440709 -->

<!-- ########################## -->
## February 2018

### Device enrollment

#### Intune support for multiple Apple DEP / Apple School Manager accounts<!-- 747685 -->

Intune now supports enrolling devices from up to 100 different [Apple Device Enrollment Program (DEP)](../enrollment/device-enrollment-program-enroll-ios.md) or [Apple School Manager](../enrollment/apple-school-manager-set-up-ios.md) accounts. Each token uploaded can be managed separately for enrollment profiles and devices. A different enrollment profile can be automatically assigned per DEP/School Manager token uploaded. If multiple School Manager tokens are uploaded, only one can be shared with Microsoft School Data Sync at a time.

After migration, the beta Graph APIs and published scripts for managing Apple DEP or ASM over Graph will no longer work. New beta Graph APIs are in development and will be released after the migration.

#### See enrollment restrictions per user<!-- 1634444 eeready wnready -->
On the **Troubleshoot** blade, you can now see the [enrollment restrictions](../enrollment/enrollment-restrictions-set.md) that are in effect for each user by selecting **Enrollment restrictions** from the **Assignments** list.

#### New option for user authentication for Apple bulk enrollment<!-- 747625 eeready -->

> [!NOTE]
> New tenants see this right away. For existing tenants, this feature is being rolled out through April. Until this roll out is complete, you might not have access to these new features.

Intune now gives you the option to authenticate devices by using the Company Portal app for the following enrollment methods:

- Apple Device Enrollment Program
- Apple School Manager
- Apple Configurator Enrollment

When using the Company Portal option, Microsoft Entra multifactor authentication can be enforced without blocking these enrollment methods.

When using the Company Portal option, Intune skips user authentication in the iOS Setup Assistant for user affinity enrollment. This feature means that the device is initially enrolled as a userless device, and so doesn't receive configurations or policies of user groups. It only receives configurations and policies for device groups. However, Intune will automatically install the Company Portal app on the Device. The first user to launch and sign in to the Company Portal app will be associated with the device in Intune. At this point, the user will receive configurations and policies of their user groups. The user association cannot be changed without re-enrollment.

#### Intune support for multiple Apple DEP / Apple School Manager accounts<!-- 747685 eeready -->

Intune now supports enrolling devices from up to 100 different Apple Device Enrollment Program (DEP) or Apple School Manager accounts. Each token uploaded can be managed separately for enrollment profiles and devices. A different enrollment profile can be automatically assigned per DEP/School Manager token uploaded. If multiple School Manager tokens are uploaded, only one can be shared with Microsoft School Data Sync at a time.

After migration, the beta Graph APIs and published scripts for managing Apple DEP or ASM over Graph will no longer work. New beta Graph APIs are in development and will be released after the migration.

### Remote printing over a secure network<!-- 1709994  -->
PrinterOn's wireless mobile printing solutions will enable users to remotely print from anywhere at any time over a secure network. PrinterOn will integrate with the Intune APP SDK for both iOS and Android. You can target app protection policies to this app through the Intune **App protection policies** blade in the Intune admin center. End users can download the app 'PrinterOn for Microsoft' through the Play Store or iTunes to use within their Intune ecosystem.

### macOS Company Portal support for enrollments that use the Device Enrollment Manager<!-- 1352411 -->

Users can now use the Device Enrollment Manager when enrolling with the macOS Company Portal.

### Device management

#### Windows defender health status and threat status reports<!--854704 -->

Understanding Windows Defender's health and status is key to managing Windows PCs.  With this update, Intune adds new reports and actions to the status and health of the Windows Defender agent. Using a status roll-up report in the [Device Compliance workload](../protect/compliance-policy-monitor.md), you can see devices that need any of the following actions:
- signature update
- Restart
- manual intervention
- full scan
- other agent states requiring intervention

A drill-in report for each status category lists the individual PCs that need attention, or the PCs that report as **Clean**.

#### New privacy settings for device restrictions<!--1308926 -->
[Two new privacy settings](../configuration/device-restrictions-windows-10.md#privacy) are now available for devices:
- **Publish user activities**: When set **Block**, this setting prevents shared experiences and discovery of recently used resources in the task switcher.
- **Local activities only**: When set **Block**, this setting prevents shared experiences and discovery of recently used resources in task switcher based only on local activity.

#### New settings for the Microsoft Edge browser<!--1469166 -->
[Two new settings](../configuration/device-restrictions-windows-10.md#microsoft-edge-legacy-version-45-and-older) are now available for devices with the Microsoft Edge browser version 45 and older: **Path to favorites file** and **Changes to Favorites**.

### App management

#### Protocol exceptions for applications<!--1035509 -->

You can now create exceptions to the Intune Mobile Application Management (MAM) data transfer policy to open specific unmanaged applications. Such applications must be trusted by IT. Other than the exceptions you create, data transfer is still restricted to applications that are managed by Intune when your data transfer policy is set to **managed apps only**. You can create the restrictions by using protocols (iOS) or packages (Android).

For example, you can add the Webex package as an exception to the MAM data transfer policy. The exception allows Webex links in a managed Outlook email message to open directly in the Webex application. Data transfer will still be restricted in other unmanaged applications. For more information, see [Data transfer policy exceptions for apps](../apps/app-protection-policies-exception.md).

#### Windows Information Protection (WIP) encrypted data in Windows search results<!-- 1469193 -->
A setting in the Windows Information Protection (WIP) policy now allows you to control whether WIP-encrypted data is included in Windows search results. Set this app protection policy option by selecting **Allow Windows Search Indexer to search encrypted items** in the **Advanced settings** of the Windows Information Protection policy. The app protection policy must be set to the *Windows 10* platform and the app policy **Enrollment state** must be set to **With enrollment**. For more information, see [Allow Windows Search Indexer to search encrypted items](../apps/windows-information-protection-policy-create.md#allow-windows-search-indexer-to-search-encrypted-items).

#### Configuring a self-updating mobile MSI app<!-- 1740840 -->
You can configure a known self-updating mobile MSI app to ignore the version check process. This capability is useful to avoid getting into a race condition. For instance, this type of race condition could occur when the app is auto-updated by the app developer is being updated by Intune. Both could try to enforce a version of the app on a Windows client, which could create a conflict. For these automatically updated MSI apps, you can configure the **Ignore app version** setting in the **App information** blade. When this setting is switched to **Yes**, Microsoft Intune will ignore the app version installed on the Windows client.

#### Related sets of app licenses supported in Intune<!-- 1864117 -->
Intune in the Azure portal now supports related sets of app licenses as a single app item in the UI. In addition, any Offline Licensed apps synced from Microsoft Store for Business will be consolidated into a single app entry and any deployment details from the individual packages will be migrated over to the single entry. To view related sets of app licenses in the Azure portal, select **App licenses** from the **Client apps** blade.

### Device configuration
#### Windows Information Protection (WIP) file extensions for automatic encryption<!-- 1463582 -->
A setting in the Windows Information Protection (WIP) policy now lets you specify which file extensions are automatically encrypted when copying from a Server Message Block (SMB) share within the corporate boundary, as defined in the WIP policy.

#### Configure resource account settings for Surface Hubs

You can now remotely configure resource account settings for Surface Hubs.

The resource account is used by a Surface Hub to authenticate against Skype/Exchange so it can join a meeting.
You will want to create a unique resource account so the Surface Hub can show up in the meeting as the conference room.
For example, a resource account such as **Conference Room B41/6233**.

> [!NOTE]
> - If you leave fields blank you will override previously configured attributes on the device.
>
> - Resource Account properties can change dynamically on the Surface Hub. For example, if password rotation is on. So, it's possible that the values
in the Azure console will take some time to reflect the reality on the device.
>
>   To understand what is currently configured on the Surface Hub, the Resource Account information can be included in hardware inventory
(which already has a 7 day interval) or as read-only properties. To enhance the accuracy after the remote action has taken place, you can get the state
of the parameters immediately after running the action to update the account/parameters on the Surface Hub.

#### Additions to System Security settings for Windows 10 and later compliance policies<!--1704133-->

Additions to the Windows 10 compliance settings are now available, including requiring Firewall and Windows Defender Antivirus.

### Intune apps

#### Support for offline apps from the Microsoft Store for Business<!--1222672-->
Offline apps that you purchased from the Microsoft Store for Business are now synchronized to the Azure portal. You can deploy these apps to device groups or user groups. Offline apps are installed by Intune, not by the store.

#### Prevent end users from manually adding or removing accounts in the work profile<!-- 1728700 -->

When you deploy the Gmail app into an Android for Work profile, you can now prevent end users from manually adding or removing accounts in the work profile by using the **Add and remove accounts** setting in the Android for Work Device restrictions profile.

<!-- ########################## -->
## January 2018

### Device enrollment

#### Alerts for expired tokens and tokens that will soon expire<!-- 1639263 -->
The overview page now shows alerts for expired tokens and tokens that will soon expire. When you select an alert for a single token, you'll go to the token's details page.  If you select an alert with multiple tokens, you'll go to a list of all tokens with their status. Admins should renew their tokens before the expiration date.

### Device management

#### Remote "Erase" command support for macOS devices<!-- 1438084 -->

Admins can issue an Erase command remotely for macOS devices.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The erase command can't be reversed and should be used with caution.

The erase command removes all data, including the operating system, from a device. It also removes the device from Intune management. No warning is issued to the user and the erasure occurs immediately upon issuing the command.

You must configure a 6-digit recovery PIN. This PIN can be used to unlock the erased device, at which point reinstallation of the operating system will begin. After erasure has started, the PIN appears in a status bar on the device's overview blade in Intune. The PIN will remain as long as the erasure is underway. After erasure is complete, the device disappears entirely from Intune management. Be sure to record the recovery PIN so that whoever is restoring the device can use it.

#### Revoke licenses for an iOS Volume Purchasing Program token<!-- 820870 -->
You can revoke the license of all iOS Volume Purchasing Program (VPP) apps for a given VPP Token.

### App management

#### Revoking iOS Volume-Purchase Program apps <!-- 820863 -->
For a given device that has one or more iOS Volume-Purchase Program (VPP) apps, you can revoke the associated device-based app license for the device. Revoking an app license will not uninstall the related VPP app from the device. To uninstall a VPP app, you must change the assignment action to **Uninstall**. For more information, see [How to manage iOS apps purchased through a volume-purchase program with Microsoft Intune](../apps/vpp-apps-ios.md).

#### Assign Microsoft 365 mobile apps to iOS and Android devices using built-in app type<!-- 1332318 -->
The **Built-in** app type makes it easier for you to create and assign Microsoft 365 apps to the iOS and Android devices that you manage. These apps include Microsoft 365 apps such as Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and OneDrive. You can assign specific apps to the app type and edit the app information configuration.

#### Including and excluding app assignment based on groups<!-- 1406920 -->

During app assignment and after selecting an assignment type, you can select the groups to include, and the groups to exclude.

### Device configuration

#### You can assign an application configuration policy to groups by including and excluding assignments <!-- 1480316 -->

You can assign an application configuration policy to a group of users and devices by using a combination of including and excluding assignments. Assignments can be chosen as either a custom selection of groups or as a virtual group. A virtual group can include **All users**, **All Device**, or **All Users + All Devices**.

#### Support for Windows 10 edition upgrade policy  <!-- 903672(archived), 1119689 -->  
You can create a Windows 10 edition upgrade policy that upgrades Windows 10 devices to Windows 10 Education, Windows 10 Education N, Windows 10 Professional, Windows 10 Professional N, Windows 10 Professional Education, and Windows 10 Professional Education N.

For details about Windows 10 edition upgrades, see [How to configure Windows 10 edition upgrades](../configuration/edition-upgrade-configure-windows-10.md).

#### Conditional Access policies for Intune is only available from the Azure portal <!-- 1737088 1634311 -->

Starting with this release, you must configure and manage your Conditional Access policies in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) from **Microsoft Entra ID** > **Conditional Access**. For your convenience, you can also access this blade from Intune in the Azure portal at **Intune** > **Conditional Access**.

#### Updates to compliance emails<!--1637547 -->

When an email is sent to report a noncompliant device, details about the noncompliant device are included.

### Intune apps

#### New functionality for the "Resolve" action for Android devices<!--1583480-->

The Company Portal app for Android is expanding the "Resolve" action for **Update device settings** to resolve [device encryption issues](../user-help/encrypt-your-device-android.md).

#### Remote lock available in Company Portal app for Windows 10<!--676506-->
End users can now remotely lock their devices from the Company Portal app for Windows 10. This feature will not be displayed for the local device they're actively using.

#### Easier resolution of compliance issues for the Company Portal app for Windows 10<!--676546-->
End users with Windows devices can tap the noncompliance reason in the Company Portal app. When possible, this feature will take them directly to the correct location in the settings app to fix the issue.

<!-- ########################## -->
## 2017

<!-- ########################## -->
### December 2017

#### New automatic redeployment setting<!-- 1469168 -->
The **Automatic redeployment** setting allows users with administrative rights to delete all user data and settings using **CTRL + Win + R** at the device lock screen. The device is automatically reconfigured and reenrolled into management. This setting can be found under Windows 10 > Device restrictions > General > Automatic redeployment. For details, see [Intune device restriction settings for Windows 10](../configuration/device-restrictions-windows-10.md#general).

#### Support for other source editions in the Windows 10 edition upgrade policy <!-- 903672,  1119689 -->
You can now use the Windows 10 edition upgrade policy to upgrade from other Windows 10 editions (Windows 10 Pro, Windows 10 Pro for Education, Windows 10 Cloud, etc.). Prior to this release, the supported edition upgrade paths were more limited. For details, see [How to configure Windows 10 edition upgrades](../configuration/edition-upgrade-configure-windows-10.md).

#### New Windows Defender Security Center (WDSC) device configuration profile settings<!-- 1335507 -->

Intune adds a new section of device configuration profile settings under the Endpoint protection named **Windows Defender Security Center**. IT admins can configure which pillars of the Windows Defender Security Center app end users can access. If an IT admin hides a pillar in the Windows Defender Security Center app, all notifications related to the hidden pillar don't display on the user's device.

Admins can use these pillars to hide from the Windows Defender Security Center device configuration profile settings:
- Virus and threat protection
- Device performance and health
- Firewall and network protections
- App and browser control
- Family options

IT admins can also customize which notifications users receive. For example, you can configure whether the users receive all notifications generated by visible pillars in the WDSC, or only critical notifications. Non-critical notifications include periodic summaries of Windows Defender Antivirus activity and notifications when scans have completed. All other notifications are considered critical. Also, you can also customize the notification content itself, for example, you can provide the IT contact information to embed in the notifications that appear on the users' devices.

#### Multiple connector support for SCEP and PFX certificate handling<!-- 1361755 -->

Customers who use the on-premises NDES connector to deliver certificates to devices can now configure multiple connectors in a single tenant.

This new capability supports the following scenario:

- **High availability**

Each NDES connector pulls certificate requests from Intune.  If one NDES connector goes offline, the other connector can continue to process requests.

#### Customer subject name can use AAD_DEVICE_ID variable <!-- 1468599 -->

When you create a SCEP certificate profile in Intune, you can now use the AAD_DEVICE_ID variable when you build the custom subject name.   When the certificate is requested using this SCEP profile, the variable is replaced with the Microsoft Entra device ID of the device making the certificate request.

#### Manage Jamf-enrolled macOS devices with Intune's device compliance engine<!-- 1592747 -->
You can now use Jamf to send macOS device state information to Intune, which will then evaluate it for compliance with policies defined in the Intune console. Based on the device compliance state and other conditions (such as location, user risk, etc.), Conditional Access will enforce compliance for macOS devices accessing cloud and on-premises applications connected with Microsoft Entra ID, including Microsoft 365. Find out more about [setting up Jamf integration](../protect/conditional-access-integrate-jamf.md) and [enforcing compliance for Jamf-managed devices](../protect/conditional-access-assign-jamf.md).

#### New iOS device action  <!-- 1424701 -->

You can now shut down iOS 10.3 supervised devices. This action shuts down the device immediately without warning to the end user. The **Shut down (supervised only)** action can be found at the device properties when you select a device in the **Device** workload.

#### Disallow date/time changes to Samsung Knox devices<!-- 1468103 -->

We've added a new feature that allows you to block date and time changes on Samsung Knox devices. You can find this feature in **Devices** > **Configuration** > **Device restrictions (Android)** > **General**.

#### Surface Hub resource account supported<!-- 1566442  -->

A new device action has been added so administrators can define and update the resource account associated with a Surface Hub.

The resource account is used by a Surface Hub to authenticate with Skype/Exchange so it can join a meeting. You can create a unique resource account so the Surface Hub appears in the meeting as the conference room. For example, the resource account might appear as *Conference Room B41/6233*. The resource account (known as the device account) for the Surface Hub typically needs to be configured for the conference room location and when other resource account parameters need to be changed.

When administrators want to update the resource account on a device, they must provide the current Active Directory/Microsoft Entra credentials associated with the device. If password rotation is on for the device, administrators must go to Microsoft Entra ID to find the password.

> [!NOTE]
> All fields get sent down in a bundle and overwrite all fields that were previously configured. Empty fields also overwrite existing fields.

The following are the settings administrators can configure:

- **Resource account**
  - **Active Directory user**

    Domainname\username or User Principal Name (UPN): user@domainname.com

  - **Password**

- **Optional resource account parameters** (must be set using the specified resource account)

  - **Password rotation period**

    Ensures the account password is updated automatically by the Surface Hub every week for security reasons. To configure any parameters after setting has been enabled, the account in Microsoft Entra ID must have the password reset first.

  - **SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) address**

    Only used when autodiscovery fails.

  - **Email**

    Email address of the device/resource account.

  - **Exchange server**

    Only required when autodiscovery fails.

  - **Calendar sync**

    Specifies whether calendar sync and other Exchange server services are enabled. For example: meeting sync.

#### Install Office apps on macOS devices<!-- 1494311 -->
You will now be able to install Office apps on macOS devices. This new app type allows you to install Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, and OneNote. These apps also come with the Microsoft AutoUpdate (MAU), to help keep your apps secure and up-to-date.


#### Delete an iOS  Volume Purchasing Program token<!-- 820879 -->
You can delete the iOS Volume Purchasing Program (VPP) token using the console. This feature might be necessary when you have duplicate instances of a VPP token.

#### A new entity collection named Current User is limited to currently active user data<!-- 1667026 -->

The **Users** entity collection contains all the Microsoft Entra users with assigned licenses in your enterprise. For example, a user might be added to Intune and then removed during the last month. While this user isn't present at the time of the report, the user and state are present in the data. You could create a report that would show the duration of the user's historic presence in your data.

In contrast, the new **Current User** entity collection only contains users who have not been removed. The **Current User** entity collection only contains currently active users. For information about the **current user** entity collection, see [Reference for current user entity](../developer/reports-ref-data-model.md).

### Updated Graph APIs<!-- 1736360 -->

In this release, we've updated a few of the Graph APIs for Intune that are in beta. Review the monthly [Graph API changelog](/graph/changelog) for more information.


#### Intune supports Windows Information Protection (WIP) denied apps<!-- 1479103 -->
You can specify denied apps in Intune. If an app is denied, the app is blocked from accessing corporate information, effectively the opposite of the allowed apps list. For more information, see [Recommended blocklist for Windows Information Protection](/windows/client-management/mdm/applocker-csp?f=255&MSPPError=-2147217396#recommended-deny-list-for-windows-information-protection).

<!-- ########################## -->
### November 2017

#### Troubleshoot enrollment issues <!-- 746324 -->

The **Troubleshoot** workspace now shows user enrollment issues. Details about the issue and suggested remediation steps can
help administrators and help desk operators troubleshoot problems. Certain enrollment issues aren't captured and some errors
might not have remediation suggestions.

#### Group-assigned enrollment restrictions<!-- 747598 -->

As an Intune administrator, you can now [create custom Device Type and Device Limit enrollment restrictions for user groups](../enrollment/enrollment-restrictions-set.md).

The Intune Azure portal lets you create up to 25 instances of each restriction type, which can then be assigned to user groups. Group-assigned restrictions override the default restrictions.

All the instances of a restriction type are maintained in a strictly ordered list. This order defines a priority value for conflict resolution. A user affected by more than one restriction instance is only restricted by the instance with the highest priority value. You can change a given instance's priority by dragging it to a different position in the list.

This functionality will be released with the migration of Android for Work settings from the Android For Work enrollment menu to the Enrollment Restrictions menu. Since this migration can take several days, your account might be upgraded for other parts of the November release before you see group assignment become enabled for Enrollment Restrictions.

#### Support for multiple Network Device Enrollment Service (NDES) connectors<!-- 1528104 -->

NDES allows mobile devices running without domain credentials to obtain certificates based on the Simple Certificate Enrollment Protocol (SCEP).
With this update, multiple NDES connectors are supported.

#### Manage Android for Work devices independently from Android devices<!-- 1490731 EEready-->

Intune supports managing enrollment of Android for Work devices independently from the Android platform. These settings are managed under **Device Enrollment** > **Enrollment restrictions** > **Device Type Restrictions**. (They were previously located under **Device Enrollment** > **Android for Work Enrollment** > **Android for Work Enrollment Settings**.)

By default, your Android for Work devices settings are the same as your settings for your Android devices. However, after you change your Android for Work settings that will no longer be the case.

If you block personal Android for Work enrollment, only corporate Android devices can enroll as Android for Work.

When working with the new settings, consider the following points:

#### If you have never previously onboarded Android for Work enrollment

The new Android for Work platform is blocked in the default Device Type Restrictions. After you onboard the feature, you can allow devices to enroll with Android for Work. To do so, change the default or create a new Device Type Restriction to supersede the default Device Type Restriction.

#### If you have onboarded Android for Work enrollment

If you've previously onboarded, your situation depends on the setting you chose:

| Setting | Android for Work status in default Device Type Restriction | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Manage all devices as Android** | Blocked | All Android devices must enroll without Android for Work. |
| **Manage supported devices as Android for Work** | Allowed | All Android devices that support Android for Work must enroll with Android for Work. |
| **Manage supported devices for users only in these groups as Android for Work** | Blocked | A separate Device Type Restriction policy was created to override the default. This policy defines the groups you previously selected to allow Android for Work enrollment. Users within the selected groups will continue to be allowed to enroll their Android for Work devices. All other users are restricted from enrolling with Android for Work. |

In all cases, your intended regulation is preserved. No action is required on your part to maintain the global or per-group allowance of Android for Work in your environment.

#### Google Play Protect support on Android<!-- 908720 -->

With the release of Android Oreo, Google introduces a suite of security features called Google Play Protect that allow users and organizations to run secure apps and secure Android images. Intune now supports Google Play Protect features, including SafetyNet remote attestation. Admins can set compliance policy requirements that require Google Play Protect to be configured and healthy.

The **SafetyNet device attestation** setting requires the device to connect with a Google service to verify that the device is healthy and isn't compromised. Admins can also set a configuration profile setting for Android for Work to require that installed apps are verified by Google Play services. If a device is noncompliant with Google Play Protect requirements, Conditional Access might block users from accessing corporate resources.

- Learn [How to create a device compliance policy to enable Google Play Protect](../protect/compliance-policy-create-android.md).

#### Text protocol allowed from managed Apps<!-- 1414050  -->

Apps managed by the Intune App SDK can send SMS messages.


#### App install report updated to include Install Pending status<!-- 1249446 -->  

The **App install status** report, accessible for each app through the **App** list in the **Client apps** workload, now contains an **Install Pending** count for Users and Devices.

#### iOS 11 app inventory API for Mobile Threat Detection<!-- 1391759 -->

Intune collects app inventory information from both personal and corporate-owned devices and makes it available for Mobile Threat Detection (MTD) providers to fetch, such as Lookout for Work. You can collect an app inventory from the users of iOS 11+ devices.

**App inventory**  
Inventories from both corporate-owned iOS 11+ and personally owned devices are sent to your MTD service provider. Data in the app inventory includes:

- App ID
- App Version
- App Short Version
- App Name
- App Bundle Size
- App Dynamic Size
- App is validated or not
- App is managed or not

#### Migrate hybrid MDM users and devices to Intune standalone<!-- 1463747 wnready -->
New processes and tools are now available for moving users and their devices from hybrid MDM to Intune in the Azure portal, allowing you to do the following tasks:
- Copy policies and profiles from the Configuration Manager console to Intune in the Azure portal
- Move a subset of users to Intune in the Azure portal, while keeping the rest in hybrid MDM
- Migrate devices to Intune in the Azure portal without needing to re-enroll them

#### On-premises Exchange connector high availability support <!-- 676614 -->
After the Exchange connector creates a connection to Exchange using the specified Client Access Server (CAS), the connector now has the ability to discovery other CASs. If the primary CAS becomes unavailable, the connector will fail over to another CAS, if available, until the primary CAS becomes available. For details, see [On-premises Exchange connector high availability support](../protect/exchange-connector-install.md#on-premises-intune-exchange-connector-high-availability-support).

#### Remotely restart iOS device (supervised only)<!-- 1424595 -->

You can now trigger a supervised iOS 10.3+ device to restart using a device action. For more information on using the device restart action, see [Remotely restart devices with Intune](../remote-actions/device-restart.md).

> [!Note]
> This command requires a supervised devices and the **Device Lock** access right. The device restarts immediately. Passcode-locked iOS devices will not rejoin a Wi-Fi network after restart; after restart, they might not be able to communicate with the server.

#### Single Sign-on support for iOS<!-- 1333645 -->  

You can use Single Sign-on for iOS users. The iOS apps that are coded to look for user credentials in the Single Sign-on payload are functional with this payload configuration update. You can also use UPN and Intune Device ID to configure the Principal Name and Realm. For details, see [Configure Intune for iOS device single sign-on](../configuration/ios-device-features-settings.md#single-sign-on).

#### Add "Find my iPhone" for personal devices<!--1427287-->
You can now view whether iOS devices have Activation Lock turned on. This feature previously could be found in the Intune in the classic portal.

#### Remotely lock managed macOS device with Intune<!-- 1437691 -->

You can lock a lost macOS device, and set a 6-digit recovery PIN. When locked, the **Device overview** blade displays the PIN until another device action is sent.

For more information, see [Remotely lock managed devices with Intune](../remote-actions/device-remote-lock.md).

#### New SCEP profile details supported<!-- 1559808 -->

Administrators are now able to set more settings when creating a SCEP profile on Windows, iOS, macOS, and Android platforms.  Administrators can set IMEI, serial number, or common name including email in the subject name format.

#### Windows Defender Application Guard helps protect devices from untrusted websites, as defined by your organization<!-- 958257 -->   
Admins can define sites as "trusted" or "corporate" using a Windows Information Protection workflow or the new "Network boundary" profile under device configurations. If they are viewed with Microsoft Edge, any sites that aren't listed in on a 64-bit Windows 10 device's trusted network boundary open instead in a browser within a Hyper-V virtual computer.

Application Guard can be found in the device configuration profiles, in the "Endpoint protection" profile. From there, admins can configure interaction between the virtualized browser and the host machine, nontrusted sites and trusted sites, and storing data generated in the virtualized browser. To use Application Guard on a device, a network boundary first must be configured. It's important to define only one network boundary for a device.  

#### Windows Defender Application Control on Windows 10 Enterprise provides mode to trust only authorized apps<!-- 1031096 -->    
With thousands of new malicious files created every day, using antivirus signature-based detection to fight against malware might no longer provide an adequate defense against new attacks. Using Windows Defender Application Control on Windows 10 Enterprise, you can change device configuration from a mode where apps are trusted unless blocked by an antivirus or other security solution, to a mode where the operating system trusts only apps authorized by your enterprise. You assign trust to apps in Windows Defender Application Control.

Using Intune, you can configure the application control policies either in "audit only" mode or enforce mode. Apps aren't blocked when running in "audit only" mode. "Audit only" mode logs all events in local client logs. You can also configure whether only Windows components and Microsoft Store apps are allowed to run, Or, configure if other apps with good reputations as defined by the Intelligent Security Graph are allowed to run.

#### Window Defender Exploit Guard is a new set of intrusion prevention capabilities for Windows 10<!-- 1063615 -->   
Window Defender Exploit Guard includes custom rules to reduce the exploitability of applications, prevents macro and script threats, automatically blocks network connections to low reputation IP addresses, and can secure data from ransomware and unknown threats. Windows Defender Exploit Guard consists of the following components:

- **Attack Surface Reduction** provides rules that allow you to prevent macro, script, and email threats.
- **Controlled Folder access** automatically blocks access to content to protected folders.
- **Network Filter** blocks outbound connection from any app to low rep IP/domain
- **Exploit Protection** provides memory, control flow, and policy restrictions that can be used to protect an application from exploits.

#### Windows 10 kiosk mode device restrictions<!-- 1308872 -->   
You can restrict Windows 10 device users to kiosk mode, which limits users to a set of predefined apps.  To do so, create a Windows 10 device restriction profile and set the Kiosk settings.

Kiosk mode supports two modes: **single app** (allows a user to run just one app) or **multi app** (permits access to a set of apps).  You define the user account and device name, which determines the supported apps).  When the user is logged in, they're limited to the defined apps.  To learn more, see [AssignedAccess CSP](/windows/client-management/mdm/assignedaccess-csp). 

Kiosk mode requires:

- Intune must be the MDM authority.
- The apps must already be installed on the target device.
- The device must be [properly provisioned](/windows/configuration/set-up-a-kiosk-for-windows-10-for-desktop-editions).

#### New device configuration profile for creating network boundaries<!-- 1311967 -->   
A new device configuration profile called **Network boundary** can be found with your other device configuration profiles. Use this profile to define online resources that you want to be considered corporate and trusted. You must define a network boundary for a device *before* features such as Windows Defender Application Guard and Windows Information Protection can be used on the device. It's important to define only one network boundary for each device.

You can define enterprise cloud resources, IP address ranges, and internal proxy servers that you want to be considered trusted. Once defined, the network boundary can be consumed by other features such as Windows Defender Application Guard and Windows Information Protection.

#### Two new settings for Windows Defender Antivirus<!-- 1338409 -->  
**File blocking level**

| Setting | Details |
|---|---|
| Not Configured | **Not Configured** uses the default Windows Defender Antivirus blocking level and provides strong detection without increasing the risk of detecting legitimate files. |
| High | **High** applies a strong level of detection.
| High +  | **High +** provides the High level with more protection measures that might affect client performance.
| Zero tolerance  | **Zero tolerance** blocks all unknown executables. |

While unlikely, setting to **High** can cause some legitimate files to be detected.
We recommend you set File blocking level to the default, **Not configured**.

**Time out extension for file scanning by the cloud**  

| Setting | Detail |
|--|--|
| Number of seconds (0-50) | Specify the maximum amount of time that Windows Defender Antivirus should block a file while waiting for a result from the cloud. The default amount is 10 seconds: any additional time specified here (up to 50 seconds) is added to those 10 seconds. In most cases, the scan takes much less time than the maximum. Extending the time allows the cloud to thoroughly investigate suspicious files. We recommend that you enable this setting and specify at least 20 additional seconds. |

#### Citrix VPN added for Windows 10 devices<!-- 1512457 -->  
You can configure Citrix VPN for their Windows 10 devices. You can choose the Citrix VPN in the *Select a connection type* list in the **Base VPN** blade when configuring a VPN for Windows 10 and later.

> [!Note]
> Citrix configuration existed for iOS and Android.

#### Wi-Fi connections support pre-shared keys on iOS<!-- 1550823 -->
Customers can configure Wi-Fi profiles to use pre-shared keys (PSK) for WPA/WPA2 Personal connections on iOS devices. These profiles are pushed to user's device when the device is enrolled into Intune.

When the profile has been pushed to the device, the next step depends on the profile configuration.  If set to connect automatically, it does so when the network is next needed.  When the profile is connects manually, the user must activate the connection manually.  

#### Access to managed app logs for iOS<!-- 1469920 -->

### Push notifications for end users on the Company Portal app for Android Oreo<!--1475932-->

End users see more notifications to indicate to them when the Company Portal app for Android Oreo is performing background tasks, such as retrieving policies from the Intune service. This feature:

- Increases transparency for end users about when the Company Portal is performing administrative tasks on their device.
- Is part of the overall [optimization of the Company Portal UI](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/intunesupport/2017/08/21/android-8-0-o-behaviour-changes-and-microsoft-intune) for the Company Portal app for Android Oreo

There are further optimizations for new UI elements that are enabled in Android Oreo.  End users see more notifications that will indicate to them when Company Portal is performing background tasks such as retrieving policy from the Intune service.  This increases transparency for end users about when Company Portal is performing administrative tasks on the device.

#### New behaviors for the Company Portal app for Android with work profiles<!-- 1485783 -->

When you enroll an Android for Work device with a work profile, it's the Company Portal app in the work profile that performs management tasks on the device. 

Unless you're using a MAM-enabled app in the personal profile, the Company Portal app for Android no longer serves any use. To improve the work profile experience, Intune will automatically hide the personal Company Portal app after a successful work profile enrollment.

The Company Portal app for Android can be enabled at any time in the personal profile by browsing for [Company Portal in the Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.microsoft.windowsintune.companyportal) and tapping **Enable**.

#### Company Portal for Windows 8.1 and Windows Phone 8.1 moving to sustaining mode<!--1428681-->

Beginning in October 2017, the Company Portal apps for Windows 8.1 and Windows Phone 8.1 will move to sustaining mode. Apps and existing scenarios, such as enrollment and compliance, will continue to be supported for these platforms. These apps will continue to be available for download through existing release channels, such as the Microsoft Store. 

Once in sustaining mode, these apps will only receive critical security updates. There will be no other updates or features released for these apps. For new features, we recommend that you update devices to Windows 10 or Windows 10 Mobile. 


#### Block unsupported Samsung Knox device enrollment <!-- 1490695 -->

The Company Portal app only attempts to enroll supported Samsung Knox devices. To avoid Knox activation errors that prevent MDM enrollment, device enrollment is only attempted if the device appears in the [list of devices published by Samsung](https://www.samsungknox.com/knox-supported-devices/knox-workspace). Samsung devices can have model numbers that support Knox while others that don't. Verify Knox compatibility with your device reseller before purchase and deployment. You can find the full list of verified devices in the [Android and Samsung Knox Standard policy settings](supported-devices-browsers.md#intune-supported-web-browsers).

#### End of support for Android 4.3 and lower<!-- 1171126, 1326920 -->
Managed apps and the Company Portal app for Android will require Android 4.4 and higher to access company resources. By December, all enrolled devices will be force-retired in December, resulting in loss of access to company resources. If you're using app protection policies without MDM, apps will not receive updates, and the quality of their experience will diminish over time.

#### Inform end users what device information can be seen on enrolled devices<!--1165314-->
We are adding **Ownership Type** to the Device Details screen on all Company Portal apps. This feature:

- Allows users to find out more about privacy directly from the [What information can your company see?](../user-help/what-info-can-your-company-see-when-you-enroll-your-device-in-intune.md) article.
- Will be rolling out across all Company Portal apps soon. We announced this information for iOS in [September](#september-2017).

<!-- ########################## -->
### September 2017

#### Intune supports iOS 11<!--1428975-->
Intune supports iOS 11. This support was previously announced on the [Intune Support blog](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/intunesupport/2017/09/12/support-tip-intune-support-for-ios-11/).

#### End of support for iOS 8.0<!-- 1164477 -->
Managed apps and the Company Portal app for iOS will require iOS 9.0 and higher to access company resources. Devices that aren't updated before this September will no longer be able to access the Company Portal or those apps. 

#### Refresh action added to the Company Portal app for Windows 10<!--1132468-->
The Company Portal app for Windows 10 allows users to refresh the data in the app by either pulling to refresh or, on desktops, pressing F5.

#### Inform end users what device information can be seen for iOS<!--739894-->

We have added **Ownership Type** to the Device Details screen on the Company Portal app for iOS. This feature allows users to find out more about privacy directly from this page from the Intune end user docs. They will also be able to locate this information on the About screen.

#### Allow end users to access the Company Portal app for Android without enrollment<!--1169910-->

End users will soon not have to enroll their device to access the Company Portal app for Android. End users at organizations that are using App Protection Policies will no longer receive prompts to enroll their device when they open the Company Portal app. End users will also be able to install apps from the Company Portal without enrolling the device. 


#### Easier-to-understand phrasing for the Company Portal app for Android<!--1396349-->  

The enrollment process for the Company Portal app for Android has been simplified with new text to make it easier for end users to enroll. If you have custom enrollment documentation, you will want to update it to reflect the new screens. You can find sample images on our [UI updates for Intune end user apps](whats-new-app-ui.md#week-of-september-11-2017) page.

#### Windows 10 Company Portal app added to Windows Information Protection allow policy<!-- 677129 -->

The Windows 10 Company Portal app has been updated to support Windows Information Protection (WIP). The app can be added to the WIP allow policy. With this change, the app no longer has to be added to the **Exempt** list.


<!-- ########################## -->
### August 2017

#### Improvements to device overview<!-- 1404453 -->  
Improvements to the device overview now display enrolled devices but excludes devices managed by Exchange ActiveSync. Exchange ActiveSync devices don't have the same management options as enrolled devices. To view the number of enrolled devices and number of enrolled devices by platform in Intune in the Azure portal, go **Devices** > **Overview**.

#### Improvements to device inventory collected by Intune
<!-- 961134, 1104426, 1281327, 1333543 -->
In this release, we've made the following improvements to the inventory information collected by devices you manage:
 
- For Android devices, you can now add a column to device inventory that shows the latest patch level for each device. Add the **Security patch level** column to your device list to see the patch level.
- When you filter the device view, you can now filter devices by their enrollment date. For example, you could display only devices that were enrolled after a date you specify.
- We've made improvements to the filter used by the **Last Check-in Date** item.
- In the device list, you can now display the phone number of corporate-owned devices.
Also, you can use the filter pane to search for devices by phone number.

For more information about device inventory, see [How to view Intune device inventory](../remote-actions/device-inventory.md).

#### Conditional Access support for macOS devices 
<!-- 720172 -->
You can now set a Conditional Access policy that requires Mac devices to be enrolled into Intune and compliant with its device compliance policies. For example, users can download the Intune Company Portal app for macOS and enroll their Mac devices into Intune. Intune evaluate whether the Mac device is compliant or not with requirements like PIN, encryption, OS version, and System Integrity.

- Learn more about [Conditional Access support for macOS devices](/azure/active-directory/active-directory-conditional-access-azure-portal).

#### Company Portal app for macOS is in public preview<!--1484796-->
The Company Portal app for macOS is now available as part of the public preview for Conditional Access in Enterprise Mobility + Security. This release supports macOS 10.11 and later. Get it at [https://aka.ms/macOScompanyportal](https://aka.ms/macOScompanyportal). 


#### New device restriction settings for Windows 10    
<!--1063965, 1308850  -->
In this release, we've added new settings for the [Windows 10 device restriction profile](/intune/device-restrictions-windows-10) in the following categories:

- Windows Defender SmartScreen
- App store

#### Updates to the Windows 10 endpoint protection device profile for BitLocker settings
<!--1459533 -->    
In this release, we've made the following improvements to how BitLocker settings work in a Windows 10 endpoint protection device profile:
 
- Under **BitLocker OS drive settings**, for the setting **BitLocker with non-compatible TPM chip**, when you select **Block**, previously, this value would cause BitLocker to actually be allowed. Now, it blocks BitLocker when it's selected.
- Under **BitLocker OS drive settings**, for the setting **Certificate-based data recovery agent**, you can now explicitly block the certificate-based data recovery agent. By default, however, the agent is allowed.
- Under **BitLocker fixed data-drive settings**, for the setting **Data recovery agent**, you can now explicitly block the data recovery agent.
For more information, see [Endpoint protection settings for Windows 10 and later](../protect/endpoint-protection-windows-10.md).


#### New signed-in experience for Android Company Portal users and App Protection Policy users<!-- 621669 -->
End users can now browse apps, manage devices, and view IT contact information using the Android Company Portal app without enrolling their Android devices. In addition, if an end user already uses an app protected by Intune App Protection Policies and launches the Android Company Portal, the end user no longer receive a prompt to enroll the device.

#### New setting in the Android Company Portal app to toggle battery optimization<!--1405990-->
The **Settings** page in the Company Portal app for Android has a new setting that easily lets users turn off battery optimization for Company Portal and Microsoft Authenticator apps. The app name shown in the setting will vary depending on which app manages the work account. We recommend that users turn battery optimization off for better performance of work apps that sync email and data. 

#### Multi-identity support for OneNote for iOS<!-- 1234281 -->
End users can now use different accounts (work and personal) with Microsoft OneNote for iOS. App protection policies can be applied to corporate data in work notebooks without affecting their personal notebooks. For example, a policy can allow a user to find information in work notebooks, but will prevent the user from copying and pasting and corporate data from the work notebook to a personal notebook.
 
- Learn more about the apps that support [app protection and multi-identity](https://www.microsoft.com/cloud-platform/microsoft-intune-apps) with Intune.

#### New settings to allow and block apps on Samsung Knox Standard devices
<!-- 1305423 822899-->  
In this release, we are adding new [device restriction settings](../configuration/device-restrictions-android.md) that let you specify the following app lists:
 
- Apps that users are allowed to install
- Apps that users are blocked from running
- Apps that are hidden from the user on the device
 
You can specify the app by URL, package name or from the list of apps you manage.

<a name='new-azure-ad-app-based-conditional-access-policy-ui-link-from-intune'></a>

#### New Microsoft Entra app-based Conditional Access policy UI link from Intune
<!-- 1016201 -->
IT admins can now set app-based conditional policies via the new Conditional Access policy UI in the Microsoft Entra workload. The app-based Conditional Access that is in the Intune App Protection section in the Azure portal will remain there for the time being and will be enforced side-by-side. There's also a convenience link to the new Conditional Access policy UI in the Intune workload.

- Learn more about [app-based Conditional Access on Microsoft Entra ID](/azure/active-directory/active-directory-conditional-access-technical-reference).

<!-- ########################## -->
### July 2017

#### Restrict Android and iOS device enrollment restriction by OS version <!-- 1333256,  1245463 -->
Intune now supports restricting iOS and Android enrollment by operating system version number. Under **Device Type Restriction**, the IT admin can now set a platform configuration to restrict enrollment between a minimum and maximum operating system value. Android operating system versions must be specified as Major.Minor.Build.Rev, where Minor, Build and Rev are optional. iOS versions must be specified as Major.Minor.Build where Minor and Build are optional. Learn more about [device enrollment restrictions](../enrollment/enrollment-restrictions-set.md).

>[!NOTE]
>Does not restrict enrollment through Apple enrollment programs or Apple Configurator.

#### Restrict Android, iOS, and macOS device personally owned device enrollment <!-- 1333272,  1333275, 1245709 -->
Intune can restrict personal device enrollment by adding corporate device IMEI numbers to an allowlist. Intune has now expanded this functionality to iOS, Android, and macOS using device serial numbers. By uploading the serial numbers to Intune, you can predeclare devices as corporate-owned. Using enrollment restrictions, you can block personally owned (BYOD) devices, allowing enrollment only for corporate-owned devices. Learn more about [device enrollment restrictions](../enrollment/enrollment-restrictions-set.md).

To import serial numbers, go **Device enrollment** > **Corporate device identifiers** > **Add**. Upload a .CSV file (no header, two columns for serial number and details like IMEI numbers). To restrict personally owned devices, go **Device enrollment** > **Enrollment restrictions**. Under **Device Type Restrictions**, select the **Default** and then select **Platform Configurations**. You can **Allow** or **Block** personally owned devices for iOS, Android, and macOS.


#### New device action to force devices to sync with Intune<!-- 711369 -->
In this release, we've added a new device action that forces the selected device to immediately check in with Intune. When a device checks in, it immediately receives any pending actions or policies that have been assigned to it.  This action can help you to immediately validate and troubleshoot policies you've assigned, without waiting for the next scheduled check-in.
For details, see [Synchronize device](../remote-actions/device-sync.md)

#### Force supervised iOS devices to automatically install the latest available software update<!-- 777100 -->
A new policy is available from the Software updates workspace where you can force supervised iOS devices to automatically install the latest available software update. For details see, [Configure iOS update policies](/intune/software-updates-ios)

#### Check Point SandBlast Mobile - New Mobile Threat Defense partner <!-- 954651, 1172027 -->
You can control mobile device access to corporate resources using Conditional Access based on risk assessment conducted by Checkpoint SandBlast Mobile. Checkpoint SandBlast Mobile is a mobile threat defense solution that integrates with Microsoft Intune.

##### How integration with Intune works?
Risk is assessed based on telemetry collected from devices running Checkpoint SandBlast Mobile. You can configure EMS Conditional Access policies based on Checkpoint SandBlast Mobile risk assessment enabled through Intune device compliance policies. You can allow or block noncompliant devices access to corporate resources based on detected threats.


#### Deploy an app as available in the Microsoft Store for Business<!-- 748101 -->
With this release, admins can now assign the Microsoft Store for Business as available. When set as available, end-users can install the app from the Company Portal app or website without being redirected to the Microsoft Store.

#### UI updates to the Company Portal website<!--1313244 part 1-->
We made several updates to the UI of the [Company Portal website](https://portal.manage.microsoft.com) to enhance the end user experience.

- __Enhancements to app tiles__:  App icons will now display with an automatically generated background based on the dominant color of the icon (if it can be detected). When applicable, this background replaces the gray border that was previously visible on app tiles.

    The Company Portal website displays large icons whenever possible in an upcoming release. We recommend that IT admins publish apps using high-resolution icons with a minimum size of 120 x120 pixels. 

- __Navigation changes__: Navigation bar items are moved to the hamburger menu in the top left. The Categories page is removed. Users can now filter content by category while browsing.

- __Updates to Featured Apps__: We've added a dedicated page to the site where users can browse apps that you've chosen to feature, and made some UI tweaks to the Featured section on the homepage.

#### iBooks support for the Company Portal website<!--1231841-->
We've added a dedicated page to the Company Portal website that allows users to browse and download iBooks. 


#### Help desk troubleshooting details<!--  Applies to 1263399, 1326964, 1341642 -->
Intune has updated the troubleshooting display and added to the information that it provides for admins and help desk staff. You can now see an **Assignments** table that summarizes all assignments for the user based on group membership. This list includes:
- Mobile apps
- Compliance policies
- Configuration profiles

In addition, the **Devices** table now includes **Microsoft Entra join type** and **Microsoft Entra compliant** columns. For more information, see [help users troubleshoot problems](help-desk-operators.md).



#### Intune Data Warehouse (Public Preview)
The Intune Data Warehouse samples data daily to provide a historical view of your tenant. You can access the data using a Power BI file (PBIX), an OData link that is compatible with many analytics tools, or interacting with the REST API. For more information, see [Use the Intune Data Warehouse](../developer/reports-nav-create-intune-reports.md).


#### Light and dark modes available for the Company Portal app for Windows 10<!--676547-->
End users can customize the color mode for the Company Portal app for Windows 10. The user is able to make the change in the Settings section of the Company Portal app. The change will appear after the user has restarted the app. For Windows 10 version 1607 and later, the app mode will default to the system setting. For Windows 10 version 1511 and earlier, the app mode will default to the light mode.

#### Enable end users to tag their device group in the Company Portal app for Windows 10<!--807046-->
End users are now able to select which group their device belongs to by tagging it directly from within the Company Portal app for Windows 10.

<!-- ########################## -->
### June 2017

#### New role-based administration access for Intune admins  <!-- 1099990 -->  
A new Conditional Access admin role is being added to view, create, modify, and delete Microsoft Entra Conditional Access policies. Previously, only global admins and security admins had this permission. Intune admins can be granted with this role permission so that they have access to Conditional Access policies.


#### Tag corporate-owned devices with serial number<!-- 1215070 -->  
Intune now supports uploading iOS, macOS, and Android serial numbers as Corporate Device Identifiers. You can't use serial numbers to block personal devices from enrolling at this time because serial numbers are not verified during enrollment. Blocking personal devices by serial number will be released soon.


#### New remote actions for iOS devices<!-- 854689 -->
In this release, we've added two new remote device actions for shared iPad devices that manage the Apple Classroom app:

- [Logout current user](../remote-actions/device-logout-user.md) - Signs out the current user of an iOS device you choose.
- [Remove user](../remote-actions/device-remove-user.md) - Deletes a user you choose from the local cache on an iOS device.


#### Support for shared iPads with the iOS Classroom app<!-- 1044681 -->
In this release, we've expanded the support for managing the iOS Classroom app to include students who log into shared iPads using their managed Apple ID.


#### Changes to Intune built-in apps<!-- 1332306 -->
Previously, Intune contained many built-in apps that you could quickly assign. Based on your feedback, we have removed this list, and you will no longer see built-in apps.
However, if you have already assigned any built-in apps, these will still be visible in the list of apps. You can continue to assign these apps as required.
In a later release, we plan to add an easier method to select and assign built-in apps from the Azure portal.

#### Easier installation of Microsoft 365 apps<!-- 1121362 -->
The new **Microsoft 365 Apps for Enterprise** app type makes it easy for you to assign Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise apps to devices that you manage which run the latest version of Windows 10. Also, you can also install Microsoft Project, and Microsoft Visio, if you own licenses for them. The apps you want are bundled together and appear as one app in the list of apps in the Intune console.
For more information, see [How to add Microsoft 365 apps for Windows 10](../apps/apps-add-office365.md).


#### Support for offline apps from the Microsoft Store for Business<!-- 777044 -->
Offline apps you purchased from the Microsoft Store for Business will now be synchronized to the Azure portal. You can then deploy these apps to device groups, or user groups. Offline apps are installed by Intune, and not by the store.

#### Microsoft Teams is now part of the App-based CA list of approved apps  <!-- 1257019 -->
The Microsoft Teams app for iOS and Android is now part of approved apps for app-based Conditional Access policies for Exchange and SharePoint Online. The app can be configured through the Intune App Protection blade in the Azure portal to all tenants currently using app-based Conditional Access.

#### Managed browser and app proxy integration<!-- 1287310 -->
The Intune Managed Browser can now integrate with the Microsoft Entra application proxy service to let users access internal web sites even when they are working remotely. Users of the browser enter the site URL as they normally would and the Managed Browser routes the request through the application proxy web gateway. For more information, see [Manage Internet access using Managed browser policies](../apps/manage-microsoft-edge.md).

#### New app configuration settings for the Intune Managed Browser<!-- 682951 -->
In this release, we've added further configurations for the Intune Managed Browser app for iOS and Android. You can now use an app configuration policy to configure the default home page and bookmarks for the browser.
For more information, see [Manage Internet access using Managed browser policies](../apps/manage-microsoft-edge.md)

#### BitLocker settings for Windows 10 <!-- 951707 -->
You can now configure BitLocker settings for Windows 10 devices using a new Intune device profile. For example, you can require that devices are encrypted, and also configure further settings that are applied when BitLocker is turned on.
For more information, see [Endpoint protection settings for Windows 10 and later](../protect/endpoint-protection-windows-10.md).

#### New settings for Windows 10 device restriction profile<!-- 978527,  978550, 978569, 1050031, 1058611,  -->
In this release, we've added new settings for the Windows 10 device restriction profile, in the following categories:

- Windows Defender
- Cellular and connectivity
- Locked screen experience
- Privacy
- Search
- Windows Spotlight
- Microsoft Edge browser

For more information about Windows 10 settings, see [Windows 10 and later device restriction settings](../configuration/device-restrictions-windows-10.md).


#### Company Portal app for Android now has a new end user experience for App Protection Policies<!--1305217-->
Based on customer feedback, we've modified the Company Portal app for Android to show an **Access Company Content** button. The intent is to prevent end users from unnecessarily going through the enrollment process when they only need to access apps that support App Protection Policies, a feature of Intune mobile application management. You can see these changes on the [what's new in app UI](whats-new-app-ui.md) page.

#### New menu action to easily remove Company Portal<!--1164569-->
Based on user feedback, the Company Portal app for Android has added a new menu action to initiate the removal of Company Portal from your device. This action removes the device from Intune management so that the app can be removed from the device by the user. You can see these changes on the [what's new in app UI](whats-new-app-ui.md) page and in the [Android end user documentation](../user-help/unenroll-your-device-from-intune-android.md).

#### Improvements to app syncing with Windows 10 Creators Update<!--676505-->
The Company Portal app for Windows 10 will now automatically initiate a sync for app install requests for devices with Windows 10 Creators Update (version 1709). This behavior will reduce the issue of app installs stalling during the "Pending Sync" state. In addition, users can manually initiate a sync from within the app. You can see these changes on the [what's new in app UI](whats-new-app-ui.md) page.

#### New guided experience for Windows 10 Company Portal<!--1058938-->
The Company Portal app for Windows 10 will include a guided Intune walkthrough experience for devices that have not been identified or enrolled. The new experience provides step-by-step instructions that guide the user through registering into Microsoft Entra ID (required for Conditional Access features) and MDM enrollment (required for device management features). The guided experience will be accessible from the Company Portal home page. Users can continue to use the app if they don't complete registration and enrollment, but will experience limited functionality.

This update is only visible on devices running Windows 10 Anniversary Update (build 1607) or higher. You can see these changes on the [what's new in app UI](whats-new-app-ui.md) page.


#### Microsoft Intune and Conditional Access admin centers are generally available
We're announcing the general availability of both the new Intune in the Azure portal admin console and the Conditional Access admin console. Through Intune in the Azure portal, you can now manage all Intune MAM and MDM capabilities in one consolidated admin experience, and use Microsoft Entra grouping and targeting. Conditional Access in Azure brings rich capabilities across Microsoft Entra ID and Intune together in one unified console. And from an administrative experience, moving to the Azure platform allows you to use modern browsers.

Intune is now visible without the **preview** label in the Azure portal at portal.azure.com.

There is no action required for existing customers at this time. Action is required if you received one of a series of messages in the message center requesting that you take action so that we can migrate your groups. You might also receive a message center notice informing you that migration is taking longer due to bugs on our side. We are diligently continuing work to migrate any affected customer.

#### Improvements to the app tiles in the Company Portal app for iOS
We updated the design of the app tiles on the homepage to reflect the branding color you set for the Company Portal. For more information, see [what's new in app UI](whats-new-app-ui.md).

#### Account picker now available for the Company Portal app for iOS
Users of iOS devices might see our new account picker when they sign into the Company Portal if they use their work or school account to sign into other Microsoft apps. For more information, see [what's new in app UI](whats-new-app-ui.md).

<!-- ########################## -->
### May 2017

#### Change your MDM authority without unenrolling managed devices<!--1103950-->
You can now change your MDM authority without having to contact Microsoft Support, and without having to unenroll and reenroll your existing managed devices. In the Configuration Manager console, you can change your MDM authority from Set to Configuration Manager (hybrid) to Microsoft Intune (standalone) or vice versa.


#### Improved notification for Samsung Knox startup PINs<!--1087143-->
When end users need to set a start-up PIN on Samsung Knox devices to become compliant with encryption, the notification displayed to end users will bring them to the exact place in the Settings app when the notification is tapped.  Previously, the notification brought the end user to the password change screen.

#### Apple School Manager (ASM) support with shared iPad<!-- 748864, 770395-->

Intune now supports use of Apple School Manager (ASM) in place of Apple Device Enrollment Program to provide out-of-box enrollment of iOS devices. ASM onboarding is required to use the Classroom app for Shared iPads, and is required to enable syncing data from ASM to Microsoft Entra ID via Microsoft School Data Sync (SDS). For more information, see [Enable iOS device enrollment with Apple School Manager](../enrollment/apple-school-manager-set-up-ios.md).

> [!NOTE]
> Configuring Shared iPads to work with the Classroom app requires iOS Education configurations in Azure are that not yet available.  This functionality will be added soon.

#### Provide remote assistance to Android devices using TeamViewer<!-- 675418 -->

Intune can now use the [TeamViewer](https://www.teamviewer.com) software, purchased separately, to enable you to give remote assistance to your users who are running Android devices. For more information, see [Provide remote assistance for Intune managed Android devices](../remote-actions/teamviewer-support.md).

#### New app protection policies conditions for MAM<!-- 679864 -->

You can now set a requirement for MAM without enrollment users that enforces the following policies:

- Minimum application version
- Minimum operating system version
- Minimum Intune APP SDK version of the targeted application (iOS only)

This feature is available on both Android and iOS. Intune supports minimum version enforcement for OS platform versions, application versions, and Intune APP SDK. On iOS, applications that have the SDK integrated can also set a minimum version enforcement at the SDK level. The user will be unable to access the targeted application if the minimum requirements through the app protection policy are not met at the three different levels mentioned above. At this point, the user can either remove their account (for multi-identity applications), close the application, or update the version of the OS or application.

You can also configure settings to provide a non-blocking notification that recommends an OS or application upgrade. This notification can be closed and the application can be used as normal.

For more information, see [iOS app protection policy settings](../apps/app-protection-policy-settings-ios.md) and [Android app protection policy settings](../apps/app-protection-policy-settings-android.md).

#### Configure app configurations for Android for Work<!-- 621621 -->
Some Android apps from the store support managed configuration options that let an IT admin control how an app runs in the work profile. With Intune, you can now view the configurations supported by an app, and configure them from the Azure portal with a configuration designer or a JSON editor. For more information, see [Use app configurations for Android for Work](../apps/app-configuration-policies-use-android.md).

#### New app configuration capability for MAM without enrollment<!-- 677969 -->
You can now create app configuration policies through the MAM without enrollment channel. This feature is equivalent to the app configuration policies available in the mobile device management (MDM) app configuration. For an example of app configuration using MAM without enrollment, see  [Manage Internet access using Managed browser policies with Microsoft Intune](../apps/manage-microsoft-edge.md).

#### Configure allowed and blocked URL lists for the Managed Browser<!-- 682960 -->
Using app configuration settings, you can now configure a list of allowed and blocked domains and URLs for the Intune Managed Browser. These settings can be configured regardless of whether the browser is used on a managed or unmanaged device. For more information, see [Manage Internet access using Managed browser policies with Microsoft Intune](../apps/manage-microsoft-edge.md).

#### App protection policy helpdesk view<!-- 1069473 -->
IT Helpdesk users can now check user license status and the status of app protection policy apps assigned to users in the Troubleshooting blade. For details, see [Troubleshooting](./help-desk-operators.md).

#### Control website visits on iOS devices<!-- 723832 -->
You can now control which websites users of iOS devices can visit using one of the following two methods:

- Add permitted, and blocked URLs using Apples built-in web content filter.

- Allow only specified websites to be accessed by the Safari browser. Bookmarks are created in Safari for each site you specify.

For more information, see [Web content filter settings for iOS devices](../configuration/ios-device-features-settings.md#web-content-filter).

#### Preconfigure device permissions for Android for Work apps<!-- 621614 -->
For apps deployed to Android for Work device work profiles, you can now configure the permissions state for individual apps.  By default, Android apps that require device permissions such as access to location or the device camera will prompt users to accept or deny permissions.  For example, if an app uses the device's microphone, then the end user is prompted to grant the app permission to use the microphone. This feature allows you to define permissions on behalf of the end user.  You can configure permissions to a) automatically deny without notifying the user, b) automatically approve without notifying the user, or c) prompt the user to accept or deny. For more information, see [Android for Work device restriction settings in Microsoft Intune](../configuration/device-restrictions-android-for-work.md).

#### Define app-specific PIN for Android for Work devices<!-- 728976, 1102534 -->
Android 7.0 and later devices with a work profile managed as an Android for Work device let the administrator define a passcode policy that only applies to apps in the work profile.  Options include:

- Define just a device-wide passcode policy - This option is the passcode that the user must use to unlock their entire device.
- Define just a work profile passcode policy - Users will be prompted to enter a passcode whenever any app in the work profile is opened.
- Define both a device and work profile policy - IT admin has the choice to define both a device passcode policy and a work profile passcode policy at differing strengths (for example, a four-digit PIN to unlock the device, but a six-digit PIN to open any work app).

For more information, see [Android for Work device restriction settings in Microsoft Intune](../configuration/device-restrictions-android-for-work.md).

> [!NOTE]
> This is only available on Android 7.0 and later.  By default, the end user can use the two separately defined PINs or they can elect to combine the two defined PINs into the strongest of the two.

#### New settings for Windows 10 devices<!-- 978585 -->

So, end users can sign in and out of the device with their Microsoft Entra credentials. The device is centrally managed whether it's in use or not in use.  When end-users sign-in, they have access to apps and get any policies applied to them. When users sign out, all app data is cleared.

#### Windows device restriction settings<!-- 818566 -->
We've added support for more [Windows device restriction settings](../configuration/device-restrictions-windows-10.md), like Microsoft Edge browser support, device lock screen customization, start menu customizations, Windows Spotlight search set wallpaper, and proxy setting.

#### Multi-user support for Windows 10 Creators Update<!-- 822547 -->
We've added support for [multi-user management](../enrollment/windows-enroll.md) for devices that run the Windows 10 Creators Update and are Microsoft Entra domain-joined. When different standard users sign in to the device with their Microsoft Entra credentials, they will receive any apps and policies that were assigned to their user name. Users cannot currently use the Company Portal for self-service scenarios like installing apps.

#### Fresh Start for Windows 10 PCs<!-- 1004830 -->
A new [Fresh Start device action](../remote-actions/device-fresh-start.md) for Windows 10 PCs is now available.  When you issue this action, any apps that were installed on the PC are removed.

#### Bulk Enroll Windows 10 devices<!-- 747607 -->
You can now join large numbers of devices that run the Windows 10 Creators update to Microsoft Entra ID and Intune with Windows Configuration Designer (WCD). To enable [bulk MDM enrollment](../enrollment/windows-bulk-enroll.md) for your Microsoft Entra tenant, create a provisioning package. The package should join devices to your Microsoft Entra tenant using Windows Configuration Designer, and apply the package to corporate-owned devices you'd like to bulk enroll and manage. Once the package is applied to your devices, they will join Microsoft Entra ID, enroll in Intune, and be ready for your Microsoft Entra users to sign in.  Microsoft Entra users are standard users on these devices and receive assigned policies and required apps. Self-service and Company Portal scenarios are not supported currently.

#### New MAM settings for PIN and managed storage locations<!-- 581122, 736644 -->
Two new app settings are now available to help you with mobile application management (MAM) scenarios:

#### Support for iOS Lost Mode<!--431695-->
For iOS 9.3 and later devices, Intune added support for **Lost Mode**. You can now lock down a device to prevent all use and display a message and contact phone number of the device lock screen.

The end user will not be able to unlock the device until an admin disables Lost Mode. When Lost Mode is enabled, you can use the **Locate device** action to display the geographical location of the device on a map in the Intune console.

The device must be a corporate-owned iOS device, and enrolled through DEP that is in supervised mode.

For more information, see [What is Microsoft Intune device management](../remote-actions/device-management.md)?

#### Improvements to Device Actions report<!--677150-->
We've made improvements to the Device Actions report that improves performance. Also, you can now filter the report by state. For example, you could filter the report to show only device actions that were completed."

#### Custom app categories<!--748805-->
You can now create, edit, and assign categories for apps you add to Intune. Currently, categories can only be specified in English.
See [How to add an app to Intune](../apps/apps-add.md).

#### Assign LOB apps to users with unenrolled devices<!--748823-->
You can now assign line-of-business apps from the store to users whether or not their devices are enrolled with Intune. If the user's device is not enrolled with Intune, they must go to the Company Portal website to install it, instead of the Company Portal app.

#### New compliance reports<!--846671-->
You now have compliance reports that give you the compliance posture of devices in your company and allow you to quickly troubleshoot compliance-related issues encountered by your users. You can view information about

- Overall compliance state of devices
- Compliance state for an individual setting
- Compliance state for an individual policy

You can also use these reports to drill down into an individual device to view specific settings and policies that affect that device.

<!-- You can now create an edition upgrade policy to upgrade devices to the following Windows 10 editions:

- Windows 10 Professional
- Windows 10 Professional N
- Windows 10 Professional Education
- Windows 10 Professional Education N -->

#### Direct access to Apple enrollment scenarios<!--951869-->
For Intune accounts created after January 2017, Intune has enabled direct access to Apple enrollment scenarios using the Enroll Devices workload in the Azure portal. Previously, the Apple enrollment preview was only accessible from links in the Azure portal. Intune accounts created before January 2017 will require a one-time migration before these features are available in Azure. The schedule for migration has not been announced yet, but details will be made available as soon as possible. We strongly recommend creating a trial account to test out the new experience if your existing account cannot access the preview.


<!-- ########################## -->
### February 2017

#### Ability to restrict mobile device enrollment<!--747600, 795782-->
Intune is adding new enrollment restrictions that control the mobile device platforms are allowed to enroll. Intune separates mobile device platforms as iOS, macOS, Android, Windows and Windows Mobile.

- Restricting mobile device enrollment does not restrict PC client enrollment.  
- For iOS and Android only, there is another option to block the enrollment of personally owned devices.

Intune marks all new devices as personal unless the IT admin takes action to mark them as corporate-owned, as explained in [this article](/mem/intune/fundamentals/deployment-guide-enrollment).

#### View all actions on managed devices<!--677150-->
A new __Device Actions__ report shows who has performed remote actions like factory reset on devices, and shows the status of that action. See [What is device management?](../remote-actions/device-management.md).

#### Non-managed devices can access assigned apps<!--664691-->
As part of the design changes on the Company Portal website, iOS and Android users can install apps assigned to them as "available without enrollment" on their non-managed devices. Using their Intune credentials, users can sign into the Company Portal website and see the list of apps assigned to them. The app packages of the "available without enrollment" apps are made available for download via the Company Portal website. Apps that require enrollment for installation are not affected by this change, as users are prompted to enroll their device if they wish to install those apps.

#### Custom app categories<!--748805-->
You can now create, edit, and assign categories for apps you add to Intune. Currently, categories can only be specified in English.
See [How to add an app to Intune](../apps/apps-add.md).

#### Display device categories<!--814654-->
You can now view the device category as a column in the device list. You can also edit the category from the properties section of the device properties blade. See [How to add an app to Intune](../apps/apps-add.md).

#### Configure Windows Update for Business settings<!--776716-->

Windows as a Service is the new way of providing updates for Windows 10. Starting with Windows 10, any new Feature Updates and Quality Updates will contain the contents of all previous updates. As long as you've installed the latest update, you know that your Windows 10 devices are up-to-date. Unlike with previous versions of Windows, you now must install the entire update instead of part of an update.

By using Windows Update for Business, you can simplify the update management experience so that you don't need to approve individual updates for groups of devices. You can still manage risk in your environments by configuring an update rollout strategy and Windows Update will make sure that updates are installed at right time. Microsoft Intune can configure update settings on devices and gives you the ability to defer update installation. Intune doesn't store the updates, but only the update policy assignment. Devices access Windows Update directly for the updates.Use Intune to configure and manage **Windows 10 update rings**. An update ring contains a group of settings that configure when and how Windows 10 updates get installed. For details, see [Configure Windows Update for Business settings](../protect/windows-update-for-business-configure.md).
