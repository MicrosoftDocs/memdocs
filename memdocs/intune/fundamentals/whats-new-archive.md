## Week of April 15, 2024

### Intune apps

#### Newly available protected app for Intune<!-- 26740168 -->

The following protected app is now available for Microsoft Intune:

- Atom Edge by Arlanto Apps

For more information about protected apps, see [Microsoft Intune protected apps](../apps/apps-supported-intune-apps.md).

## Week of April 1, 2024

### Device management

#### Copilot in Intune is available in the Intune admin center (public preview)<!-- 24105429 26122887 24205474 24205510 24205460 26113632-->

Copilot in Intune is integrated in the Intune admin center, and can help you get information quickly. You can use Copilot in Intune for the following tasks:

✅ **Copilot can help you manage your settings and policies**

- **Copilot tooltip on settings**: When you add settings to a policy or review settings in an existing policy, there's a new Copilot tooltip. When you select the tooltip, you get AI generated guidance based on Microsoft content and recommendations. You can see what each setting does, how the setting works, any recommended values, if the setting is configured in another policy, and more.

- **Policy summarizer**: On existing policies, you get a Copilot summary of the policy. The summary describes what the policy does, the users and groups assigned to the policy, and the settings in the policy. This feature can help you understand the impact of a policy and its settings on your users and devices.

✅ **Copilot shows device details and can help troubleshoot**

- **All about a device**: On a device, you can use Copilot to get key information about the device, including its properties, configuration, and status information.

- **Device compare**: Use Copilot to compare the hardware properties and device configurations of two devices. This feature helps you determine what's different between two devices with similar configurations, especially when troubleshooting.

- **Error code analyzer**: Use Copilot in the device view to analyze an error code. This feature helps you understand what the error means and provides a potential resolution.

✅ **Intune capabilities in Copilot for Security**

Intune has capabilities available in the Copilot for Security portal. SOC Analysts and IT admins can use these capabilities to get more information on policies, devices, group membership, and more. On a single device, you can get more specific information that's unique to Intune, like compliance status, device type, and more.

You can also ask Copilot to tell you about a user's devices and get a quick summary of critical information. For example, the output shows links to the user's devices in Intune, device ID, enrollment date, last check-in date, and compliance status. If you're an IT admin and reviewing a user, then this data provides a quick summary.

As a SOC analyst that's investigating a suspicious or potentially compromised user or device, information like enrollment date and last check-in can help you make informed decisions.

For more information on these features, see:

- [Microsoft Copilot in Intune](../copilot/copilot-intune-overview.md)
- [Access your Microsoft Intune data in Copilot for Security](../copilot/security-copilot.md)

Applies to:

- Android
- iOS/iPadOS
- macOS
- Windows

#### GCC customers can use Remote Help for Windows and Android devices<!-- 10613615 25825071-->

The [Microsoft Intune Suite](intune-add-ons.md) includes advanced endpoint management and security features, including Remote Help.

On Windows and enrolled Android Enterprise dedicated devices, you can use remote help on US Government GCC environments.

For more information on these features, see:

- [Microsoft Intune for US Government GCC service description](intune-govt-service-description.md)
- [Use Remote Help with Microsoft Intune](remote-help.md)

Applies to:

- Windows 10/11
- Windows 10/11 on ARM64 devices
- Windows 365
- Samsung and Zebra devices enrolled as Android Enterprise dedicated devices

### Device configuration

#### New BIOS device configuration profile for OEMs<!-- 9278502 -->

There's a new **BIOS configuration and other settings** device configuration policy for OEMs. Admins can use this new policy to enable or disable different BIOS features that secure device. In the Intune device configuration policy, you add the BIOS configuration file, deploy a Win32 app, and then assign the policy to your devices.

For example, admins can use the [Dell Command tool](https://www.dell.com/support/kbdoc/000108963/how-to-use-and-troubleshoot-dell-command-update-to-update-all-drivers-bios-and-firmware-for-your-system) (opens Dell's website) to create the BIOS configuration file. Then, they add this file to the new Intune policy.

For more information on this feature, see [Use BIOS configuration profiles on Windows devices in Microsoft Intune](../configuration/bios-configuration.md).

Applies to

- Windows 10 and later

## Week of March 25, 2024 (Service release 2403)

### Microsoft Intune Suite

#### New elevation type for Endpoint Privilege Management<!-- 25230692 -->

Endpoint Privilege Management has a new file elevation type, **support approved**. Endpoint Privilege Management is a feature component of the Microsoft Intune Suite and is also available as a standalone [Intune add-on](../fundamentals/intune-add-ons.md).

A support-approved elevation gives you a third option for both the default elevation response and the elevation type for each rule. Unlike automatic or user confirmed, a support-approved elevation request requires Intune administrators to manage which files can run as elevated on a case-by-case basis.

With support approved elevations, users can request approval to elevate an application that isn't explicitly allowed for elevation by automatic or user approved rules. This takes the form of an elevation request that must be reviewed by an Intune administrator who can approve or deny the elevation request.

When the request is approved, users are notified that the application can now be run as elevated, and they have 24 hours from the time of approval to do so before the elevation approval expires.

Applies to:

- Windows 10
- Windows 11

For more information on this new capability, see [Support approved elevation requests](../protect/epm-support-approved.md).

### App management

#### Extended capabilities for Managed Google Play apps on personally owned Android devices with a work profile<!-- 26554642 -->

There are new capabilities extended to work profile devices. The following capabilities were previously available only on corporate-owned devices:

- **Available apps for device groups**: You can use Intune to make apps available for device groups through the Managed Google Play store. Previously, apps could only be made available to user groups.

- **Update priority setting**: You can use Intune to configure the app update priority on devices with a work profile. To learn more about this setting, see [Update a Managed Google Play app](../apps/apps-add-android-for-work.md#update-a-managed-google-play-app).

- **Required apps display as available in Managed Google Play**: You can use Intune to make required apps available for users through the Managed Google Play store. Apps that are part of existing policies now display as available.

These new capabilities will follow a phased rollout over multiple months.

Applies to:

- Android Enterprise personally owned devices with a work profile

#### New archive file scan settings added to Antivirus policy for Windows devices<!-- 26801723 -->

We added the following two settings to the *Microsoft Defender Antivirus* profile for [endpoint security Antivirus policy](../protect/endpoint-security-antivirus-policy.md#antivirus-profiles) that apply to Windows 10 and Windows 11 devices:

- [Specify the maximum depth to scan archive files](/windows/client-management/mdm/policy-csp-admx-microsoftdefenderantivirus?WT.mc_id=Portal-fx#scan_archivemaxdepth) - This setting allows you to configure the maximum directory depth level into which archive files such as .ZIP or .CAB are unpacked during scanning.
- [Specify the maximum size of archive files to be scanned](/windows/client-management/mdm/policy-csp-admx-microsoftdefenderantivirus?WT.mc_id=Portal-fx#scan_archivemaxsize) - This setting allows you to configure the maximum size of archive files such as .ZIP or .CAB that are scanned. The value represents file size in kilobytes (KB).

With Antivirus policy, you can manage these settings on devices enrolled by Intune and on devices managed through the [Defender for Endpoint security settings management](../protect/mde-security-integration.md) scenario.

Both settings are also available in the [settings catalog](../configuration/settings-catalog.md) at **Devices** > **Manage devices** > **Configuration** > **Create** > **New policy** > **Windows 10 and later** for platform > **Settings catalog** for profile type > **Defender**.

### Device management

#### New compliance setting lets you verify device integrity using hardware-backed security features<!-- 12391862 -->

A new compliance setting called **Check strong integrity using hardware-backed security features** lets you verify device integrity using hardware-backed key attestation. If you configure this setting, strong integrity attestation is added to Google Play's integrity verdict evaluation. Devices must meet device integrity to remain compliant. Microsoft Intune marks devices that don't support this type of integrity check as noncompliant.

This setting is available in profiles for Android Enterprise fully managed, dedicated, and corporate-owned work profile, under **Device Health** > **Google Play Protect**. It only becomes available when the Play integrity verdict policy in your profile is set to **Check basic integrity** or **Check basic integrity & device integrity**.

Applies to:

- Android Enterprise

For more information, see [Device compliance - Google Play Protect](../protect/compliance-policy-create-android-for-work.md#google-play-protect).

#### New compliance settings for Android work profile, personal devices<!-- 24743927 -->

Now you can add compliance requirements for work profile passwords without impacting device passwords. All new Microsoft Intune settings are available in compliance profiles for Android Enterprise personally owned work profiles under **System Security** > **Work Profile Security**, and include:

- Require a password to unlock work profile
- Number of days until password expires
- Number of previous passwords to prevent reuse
- Maximum minutes of inactivity before password is required
- Password complexity
- Required password type
- Minimum password length

If a work profile password fails to meet requirements, Company Portal marks the device as noncompliant. Intune compliance settings take precedence over the respective settings in an Intune device configuration profile. For example, the password complexity in your compliance profile is set to *medium*. The password complexity in a device configuration profile is set to *high*. Intune prioritizes and enforces the compliance policy.

Applies to:

- Android Enterprise personally owned devices with a work profile

For more information, see [Compliance settings - Android Enterprise](../protect/compliance-policy-create-android-for-work.md#personally-owned-work-profile).

#### Windows quality updates support for expediting non-security updates<!-- 17614146 -->

Windows quality updates now support expediting non-security updates for those times when a quality fix needs to be deployed faster than the normal quality update settings.

Applies to:

- Windows 11 devices

For more information about installing an expedited update, see [Expedite Windows quality updates in Microsoft Intune](../protect/windows-10-expedite-updates.md#create-and-assign-an-expedited-quality-update).

#### Introducing a remote action to pause the config refresh enforcement interval<!--24249019 -->

In the Windows Settings Catalog, you can configure **Configuration Refresh**. This feature lets you set a cadence for Windows devices to reapply previously received policy settings, without requiring devices to check in to Intune. The device will replay and re-enforce settings based on previously received policy to minimize the chance for configuration drift.

To support this feature, a remote action is added to allow a pause in action. If an admin needs to make changes or run remediation on a device for troubleshooting or maintenance, they can issue a pause from Intune for a specified period. When the period expires, settings are enforced again.

The remote action **Pause configuration refresh** can be accessed from the device summary page.

For more information, see:

- [Remote actions](../remote-actions/device-management.md)
- [Pause Config Refresh Remote action](../remote-actions/pause-config-refresh.md)

### Device security

#### Updated security baseline for Windows version 23H2<!-- 25021947 -->

You can now deploy the Intune security baseline for Windows version 23H2. This new baseline is based on the **version 23H2** of the Group Policy security baseline found in the [Security Compliance Toolkit and Baselines](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=55319) from the Microsoft Download Center, and includes only the settings that are applicable to devices managed through Intune. Use of this updated baseline can help you maintain best-practice configurations for your Windows devices.

This baseline uses the unified settings platform seen in the Settings Catalog. It features an improved user interface and reporting experience, consistency and accuracy improvements related to setting tattooing, and can support assignment filters for profiles.

Use of [Intune security baselines](../protect/security-baselines.md) can help you rapidly deploy configurations to your Windows devices that meet the security recommendations of the applicable security teams at Microsoft. As with all baselines, the default baseline represents the recommended configurations, which you can modify to meet the requirements of your organization.

Applies to:

- Windows 10
- Windows 11

To view the new baselines included settings with their default configurations, see, [Windows MDM security baseline version 23H2](../protect/security-baseline-settings-mdm-all.md?pivots=mdm-23h2).

#### Use a rootless implementation of Podman to host Microsoft Tunnel<!-- 24836716 -->

When prerequisites are met, you can use a rootless Podman container to host a Microsoft Tunnel server. This capability is available when you use [Podman for Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL)](../protect/microsoft-tunnel-prerequisites.md#linux-server) version 8.8 or later, to host Microsoft Tunnel.

When using a rootless Podman container, the mstunnel services run under a non-privileged service user. This implementation can help limit impact from a container escape. To use a rootless Podman container, you must start the tunnel installation script using a modified command line.

For more information about this Microsoft Tunnel install option, see [Use a rootless Podman container](../protect/microsoft-tunnel-configure.md#use-a-rootless-podman-container).

#### Improvements for Intune deployments of Microsoft Defender for Endpoint<!-- 26314441 -->

#### New setting for updating MAC address randomization on Android Enterprise devices<!-- 24259789 -->

There's a new **MAC address randomization** setting on Android Enterprise devices (**Devices** > **Manage devices** > **Configuration** > **Create** > **New policy** > **Android Enterprise** for platform > **Fully Managed, Dedicated, and Corporate-Owned Work Profile** > **Wi-Fi** for profile type).

Starting with Android 10, when connecting to a network, devices present a randomized MAC address instead of the physical MAC address. Using randomized MAC addresses is recommended for privacy, as it's harder to track a device by its MAC address. However, randomized MAC addresses break functionality that relies on a static MAC address, including network access control (NAC).

Your options:

- **Use device default**: Intune doesn't change or update this setting. By default, when connecting to a network, devices present a randomized MAC address instead of the physical MAC address. Any updates made by the user to the setting persist.

- **Use randomized MAC**: Enables MAC address randomization on devices. When devices connect to a new network, devices present a randomized MAC address, instead of the physical MAC address. If the user changes this value on their device, it resets to **Use randomized MAC** on the next Intune sync.

- **Use device MAC**: Forces devices to present their actual Wi-Fi MAC address instead of a random MAC address. This setting allows devices to be tracked by their MAC address. Only use this value when necessary, such as for network access control (NAC) support. If the user changes this value on their device, it resets to **Use device MAC** on the next Intune sync.

Applies to:

- Android 13 and newer

For more information on the Wi-Fi settings you can configure, see [Add Wi-Fi settings for Android Enterprise dedicated and fully managed devices in Microsoft Intune](../configuration/wi-fi-settings-android-enterprise.md).

#### Turn Off Copilot in Windows setting in the Windows settings catalog<!-- 26725574 -->

#### Windows Autopilot self-deploying mode is now generally available<!-- 26780755 -->

Windows Autopilot self-deploying mode is now generally available and out of preview. Windows Autopilot self-deploying mode enables you to deploy Windows devices with little to no user interaction. Once the device connects to network, the device provisioning process starts automatically: the device joins Microsoft Entra ID, enrolls in Intune, and syncs all device-based configurations targeted to the device. Self-deploying mode ensures that the user can't access desktop until all device-based configuration is applied. The Enrollment Status Page (ESP) is displayed during OOBE so users can track the status of the deployment. For more information, see:

- [Windows Autopilot self-deploying mode](/autopilot/self-deploying)
- [Step by step tutorial for Windows Autopilot self-deploying mode in Intune](/autopilot/tutorial/self-deploying/self-deploying-workflow)

This information is also published in [Windows Autopilot: What's new](/autopilot/whats-new).

#### Windows Autopilot for pre-provisioned deployment is now generally available<!-- 26780755 -->

Windows Autopilot for pre-provisioned deployment is now generally available and out of preview. Windows Autopilot for pre-provisioned deployment is used by organizations that want to ensure devices are business-ready before the user accesses them. With pre-provisioning, admins, partners, or OEMs can access a technician flow from the Out-of-box experience (OOBE) and kick off device setup. Next, the device is sent to the user who completes provisioning in the user phase. Pre-provisioning delivers most the configuration in advance so the end user can get to the desktop faster. For more information, see:

- [Windows Autopilot for pre-provisioned deployment](/autopilot/pre-provision).

### Device management

#### New device management experience in Microsoft Intune<!-- 17585897 23692982 -->

We're rolling out an update to the device management experience in the Intune admin center. The **Devices** area now has a more consistent UI, with more capable controls and an improved navigation structure so you can find what you need faster. The new experience, previously in public preview, will gradually roll out for general availability over the coming weeks. The public preview experience continues to be available until your tenant receives the update.

The availability of this new admin center experience varies tenant by tenant. While a few will see this update immediately, many might not see the new experience for several weeks. For Government clouds, the availability of this experience is estimated around late February 2024.

Due to the rollout timelines, we're updating our documentation to the new experience as soon as possible to help ease the transition to the new admin center layout. We're unable to provide a side-by-side content experience during this transition and believe providing documentation that aligns to the newer experience brings more value to more customers. If you want to try the new experience and align with doc procedures before your tenant is updated, go to **Devices** > **Overview**, select the notification banner that reads **Preview upcoming changes to Devices and provide feedback**, and select **Try it now**.

#### BlackBerry Protect Mobile now supports app protection policies<!-- 13357196  -->

### Monitor and troubleshoot

#### Monitoring reports for devices<!-- 17744651 -->

In Intune, you can view a new list of all device monitoring reports. You can find these reports in [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431) by selecting **Devices** > **Monitor**. The **Monitor** pane provides reports related to configuration, compliance, enrollment, and software updates. Additionally, there are other reports that you can view, such as **Device actions**.

For more information, see [Intune reports](reports.md).

#### Exported report data maintains search results<!-- 17723620 -->

Intune can now maintain your report search and filter results when exporting report data. For example, when you use the [Noncompliant devices and settings](reports.md#noncompliant-devices-report-organizational) report, set the OS filter to "Windows", and search for "PC", the exported data will only contain Windows devices with "PC" in their name. This capability is also available when calling the `ExportJobs` API directly.

#### Easy upload of diagnostic logs for Microsoft Tunnel servers<!-- 15728481 -->

You can now use a single click within the Intune admin center to have Intune enable, collect, and submit eight hours of verbose logs for a Tunnel Gateway Server to Microsoft. The verbose logs can then be referenced while working with Microsoft to identify or resolve issues with a Tunnel server.

In contrast, the collection of verbose logs previously required you to sign on to the server, run manual tasks and scripts to enable and collect verbose logs, and then copy them to a location from which you can transfer them to Microsoft.

To find this new capability, in the admin center go to **Tenant administration** > **Microsoft Tunnel Gateway** > select a server > select the **Logs** tab. On this tab, is a new section named **Send verbose server logs** with button labeled **Send logs**, and a list view that displays the various log sets that have been collected and submitted to Microsoft.

When you select the **Send logs** button:

- Intune captures and submits the current server logs as a baseline, prior to collecting verbose logs.
- Verbose logging is automatically enabled at level 4, and runs for eight hours to provide time to reproduce an issue for capture in those logs.
- After eight hours, Intune submits the verbose logs and then restores the server to its default verbosity level of zero (0), for normal operations. If you previously set logs to run at a higher verbosity level, you can restore your custom verbosity level after log collection and upload is complete.
- Each time Intune collects and submits logs, it updates the list view below the button.
- Below the button is a list of past log submissions, displaying their verbosity level and an Incident ID that you can use when working with Microsoft to reference a specific set of logs.

For more information about this capability, see [Easy upload of diagnostic logs for Tunnel servers](../protect/microsoft-tunnel-monitor.md#easy-upload-of-diagnostic-logs-for-tunnel-servers).

### Device security

#### Additional settings for the Linux Antivirus policy template<!-- 24191424 -->

We expanded support for Linux by adding the following settings to the *Microsoft Defender Antivirus* template for Linux devices:

- cloudblocklevel
- scanarhives
- scanafterdefinitionupdate
- maximumondemandscanthreads
- behaviormonitoring
- enablefilehashcomputation
- networkprotection
- enforcementlevel
- nonexecmountpolicy
- unmonitoredfilesystems

The Microsoft Defender Antivirus template for Linux is supported for devices [managed by Intune](../protect/endpoint-security-antivirus-policy.md), and devices managed only by Defender through the [Defender for Endpoint security settings management](../protect/mde-security-integration.md) scenario.

#### Updated security baseline for Microsoft 365 Apps for Enterprise<!-- 25021846   -->

We released a new version of the Intune security baseline for **Microsoft 365 Apps for Enterprise**, version [**2306**](../protect/security-baselines.md#available-security-baselines).

The Microsoft 365 Office Apps baseline can help you rapidly deploy configurations to your Office Apps that meet the security recommendations of the Office and security teams at Microsoft. As with all baselines, the default baseline represents the recommended configurations. You can modify the default baseline to meet the requirements of your organization.

We also updated our [reference article](../protect/security-baseline-v2-office-settings.md?pivots=v2306) for this baseline where you can view the default configuration of the settings this baseline version includes.

#### Deprecation and replacement of two settings found in the Linux and macOS endpoint security Antivirus policies<!-- 25234740  -->

There are two deprecated settings that in the *Antivirus engine* category of [Microsoft Defender Antivirus](../protect/endpoint-security-antivirus-policy.md) profiles of both macOS and Linux. These profiles are available as part of Intune's endpoint security Antivirus policies.

For each platform, a single setting replaces the two deprecated settings. This new setting aligns with how Microsoft Defender for Endpoint manages the device configurations.

The following are the two deprecated settings:

- *Enable real-time protection* now appears as *Enable real-time protection (deprecated)*
- *Enable passive mode* now appears as *Enable passive mode (deprecated)*

The new setting that replaces the two deprecated settings:

- *Enforcement level* - By default, Enforcement level is set to *Passive* and supports options of *Real time* and *On demand*.

These settings are also available from the Intune [settings catalog](../configuration/settings-catalog.md) for each platform, where the old settings are also marked as deprecated and replaced by the new setting.

With this change, a device that has either of the *deprecated* settings configured will continue to apply that configuration until the device is targeted by the new setting *Enforcement level*. Once targeted by Enforcement Level, the deprecated settings no longer are applied to the device.

The *deprecated* settings will be removed from the Antivirus profiles and the settings catalog in a future update to Intune.

> [!NOTE]
> The changes for Linux are now available. The macOS settings are marked as deprecated, but the *Enforcement level* setting will not be available until December.

Applies to:

- Linux
- macOS

#### Microsoft Defender Firewall profiles are renamed to Windows Firewall<!-- 25171457 -->

#### New setting to block users from using the same password to unlock the device and access the work profile on Android Enterprise personally owned devices with a work profile<!-- 6167371  -->

On Android Enterprise personally owned devices with a work profile, users can use the same password to unlock the device and access the work profile.

There's a new setting that can enforce different passwords to unlock the device and access the work profile (**Devices** > **Manage devices** > **Configuration** > **Create** > **New policy** > **Android Enterprise** > **Personally Owned Work Profile** for platform > **Device Restrictions** for profile type):

- **One lock for device and work profile**: **Block** prevents users from using the same password for the lock screen on the device and work profile. End users are required to enter the device password to unlock the device and enter their work profile password to access their work profile. When set to **Not Configured** (default), Intune doesn't change or update this setting. By default, the OS might allow users to access their work profile using a single password.

This setting is optional and doesn't impact existing configuration profiles.

Currently, if the work profile password doesn't meet the policy requirements, then device users see a notification. The device isn't marked as non-compliant. A separate compliance policy for the work profile is being created and will be available in a future release.

Applies to:

- Android Enterprise personally owned devices with a work profile (BYOD)

For a list of settings you can configure on personally owned devices with a work profile, see [Android Enterprise device settings list to allow or restrict features on personally owned devices using Intune](../configuration/device-restrictions-android-enterprise-personal.md).

### Device security

#### Configure declarative software updates and passcode policies for Apple devices in the Settings Catalog<!-- 24989083  -->

You can manage software updates and passcode using Apple's declarative device management (DDM) configuration using the settings catalog (**Devices** > **Manage devices** > **Configuration** > **Create** > **New policy** > **iOS/iPadOS** or **macOS** for platform > **Settings catalog** for profile type > **Declarative device management**).

For more information about DDM, see [Apple's declarative device management (DDM)](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/devicemanagement/leveraging_the_declarative_management_data_model_to_scale_devices) (opens Apple's website).

DDM allows you to install a specific update by an enforced deadline. The autonomous nature of DDM provides an improved user experience as the device handles the entire software update lifecycle. It prompts users that an update is available and also downloads, prepares the device for the installation, & installs the update.

In the settings catalog, the following declarative software update settings are available at **Declarative device management > Software Update**:

- **Details URL**: The web page URL that shows the update details. Typically, this URL is a web page hosted by your organization that users can select if they need organization-specific help with the update.
- **Target Build Version**: The target build version to update the device to, like `20A242`. The build version can include a supplemental version identifier, like `20A242a`. If the build version you enter isn't consistent with the **Target OS Version** value you enter, then the **Target OS Version** value takes precedence.
- **Target Local Date Time**: The local date time value that specifies when to force install the software update. If the user doesn't trigger the software update before this time, then the device force installs it.
- **Target OS Version**: The target OS version to update the device to. This value is the OS version number, like `16.1`. You can also include a supplemental version identifier, like `16.1.1`.

For more information on this feature, see [Manage software updates with the settings catalog](../protect/managed-software-updates-ios-macos.md).

In the settings catalog, the following declarative passcode settings are available at **Declarative device management > Passcode**:

- **Automatic Device Lock**: Enter the maximum time period that a user can be idle before the system automatically locks the device.
- **Maximum Grace Period**: Enter the maximum time period that a user can unlock the device without a passcode.
- **Maximum Number of Failed Attempts**: Enter the maximum number of wrong passcode attempts before:
  - iOS/iPadOS wipes the device
  - macOS locks the device
- **Minimum Passcode Length**: Enter the minimum number of characters a passcode must have.
- **Passcode Reuse Limit**: Enter the number of previously used passcodes that can't be used.
- **Require Complex Passcode**: When set to **True**, a complex passcode is required. A complex passcode doesn't have repeated characters, and doesn't have increasing or decreasing characters, like `123` or `CBA`.
- **Require Passcode on Device**: When set to **True**, the user must set a passcode to access the device. If you don't set other passcode restrictions, then there aren't any requirements about the length or quality of the passcode.

Applies to:

- iOS/iPadOS 17.0 and later
- macOS 14.0 and later

### Monitor and troubleshoot 

#### Updated reports for Update rings for Windows 10 and later<!-- 10159960 -->

Reporting for [Update rings for Windows 10 and later](../protect/windows-10-update-rings.md) has been updated to use Intune's improved reporting infrastructure. These changes align to similar improvements introduced for other Intune features.

With this change for reports for Update rings for Windows 10 and later, when you select an update rings policy in the Intune admin center, there isn't a left-pane navigation for *Overview*, *Manage*, or *Monitor* options. Instead, the policy view opens to a single pane that includes the following policy details:

- **Essentials** – including the policy name, created and modified dates, and more details.
- **Device and user check-in status** – This view is the default report view and includes:
  - A high-level overview of device status for this policy, and a *View report* button to open a more comprehensive report view.
  - A streamlined representation and count of the different device status values returned by devices assigned to the policy. The simplified bar and chart replace former doughnut charts seen in the prior reporting representation.
- Two other report tiles to open more reports. These tiles include:
  - **Device assignment status** – This report combines the same information as the previous Device status and User status reports, which are no longer available. However, with this change, pivots and drill-in through based on the user name is no longer available.
  - **Per setting status** – This new report provides success metrics for each setting configured differently than the defaults, allowing for new insight to which settings might not be successfully deploying to your organization.
- **Properties** – View details for each configuration page of the policy, including an option to **Edit** each areas profile details.

For more information about reports for update rings for Windows 10 and later, see [Reports for Update rings for Windows 10 and later policy](../protect/windows-update-reports.md#reports-for-update-rings-for-windows-10-and-later-policy) in the Windows Update reports for Microsoft Intune article.

### Role-based access

#### Updating the scope of UpdateEnrollment<!--25077072 -->

With the introduction of a new role **UpdateEnrollment**, the scope of **UpdateOnboarding** is getting updated.

For more information, see [Remote Help](remote-help-windows.md).

## Week of September 4, 2023

### Device management

#### Microsoft Intune ending support for Android device administrator on devices with GMS access in August 2024<!--13891824 -->

Microsoft Intune is ending support for [Android device administrator management](../enrollment/android-enroll-device-administrator.md) on devices with access to Google Mobile Services (GMS) on August 30, 2024. After that date, device enrollment, technical support, bug fixes, and security fixes will be unavailable.

If you currently use device administrator management, we recommend switching to another Android management option in Intune before support ends.

For more information, see [Ending support for Android device administrator on GMS devices](https://aka.ms/Intune-Android-DA-blog).

## Week of August 28, 2023

### Device configuration

#### Windows and Android support for 4096-bit key size for SCEP and PFX certificate profiles<!--16314561  -->

Intune [SCEP certificate profiles](../protect/certificates-profile-scep.md) and [PKCS certificate profiles](../protect/certificates-pfx-configure.md) for Windows and Android devices now support a **Key size (bits)** of **4096**. This key size is available for new profiles and existing profiles you choose to edit.

- SCEP profiles have always included the *Key size (bits)* setting and now support 4096 as an available configuration option.
- PKCS profiles don't include the *Key size (bits)* setting directly. Instead, an admin must [modify the certificate template on the Certification Authority](../protect/certificates-pfx-configure.md#configure-certificate-templates-on-the-ca) to set the *Minimum key size* to 4096.

If you use a third-party Certificate Authority (CA), you might need to contact your vendor for assistance with implementing the 4096-bit key size.

When updating or deploying new certificate profiles to take advantage of this new key size, we recommend using a staggered deployment approach. This approach can help avoid creating excessive demand for new certificates across a large number of devices at the same time.

With this update, be aware of the following limitations on Windows devices:

- 4096-bit key storage is supported only in the *Software Key Storage Provider* (KSP). The following don't support storing keys of this size:
  - The hardware TPM (Trusted Platform Module). As a workaround you can use the Software KSP for key storage.
  - Windows Hello for Business. There isn't a workaround at this time.

### Tenant administration

#### Access policies for multiple Administrator Approval are now generally available<!-- 24936423   -->

Access policies for multiple Administrator Approval are out of public preview and are now generally available. With these policies, you can protect a resource, like App deployments, by requiring any change to the deployment to be approved by one of a group of users who are *approvers* for the resource, before that change is applied.

For more information, see [Use Access policies to require multiple administrative approval](multi-admin-approval.md).

## Week of August 21, 2023 (Service release 2308)

### App management

#### Managed Home Screen end-users prompted to grant exact alarm permission<!-- 19804494 -->  
Managed Home Screen uses the exact alarm permission to do the following actions:

- Automatically sign out users after a set time of inactivity on the device
- Launch a screen saver after a set period of inactivity
- Automatically relaunch MHS after a certain period of time when a user exits kiosk mode

For devices running Android 14 and higher, by default, the exact alarm permission will be denied. To make sure critical user functionality isn't impacted, end-users are prompted to grant exact alarm permission upon first launch of Managed Home Screen. For more information, see [Configure the Microsoft Managed Home Screen app for Android Enterprise](..\apps\app-configuration-managed-home-screen-app.md) and [Android's developer documentation]( https://developer.android.com/about/versions/14/changes/schedule-exact-alarms).

#### Managed Home Screen notifications<!-- 19805777  -->  
For Android devices running Android 13 or higher that target API level 33, by default, applications don't have permission to send notifications. In previous versions of Managed Home Screen, when an admin had enabled automatic relaunch of Managed Home Screen, a notification was displayed to alert users of the relaunch. To accommodate change to notification permission, in the scenario when an admin has enabled auto-relaunch of Managed Home Screen, the application will now display a toast message alerting users of the relaunch. Managed Home Screen is able to auto-grant permission for this notification, so no change is required for admins configuring Managed Home Screen to accommodate the change in notification permission with API level 33. For more information about Android 13 (API level 33) notification messages, see the [Android developer documentation](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/views/notifications/notification-permission). For more information about Managed Home Screen, see [Configure the Microsoft Managed Home Screen app for Android Enterprise](../apps/app-configuration-managed-home-screen-app.md).

### Device enrollment

#### Just-in-time registration and compliance remediation for iOS/iPadOS Setup Assistant with modern authentication now generally available<!-- 16276610 -->

Just in time (JIT) registration and compliance remediation for Setup Assistant with modern authentication are now out of preview and generally available. With just in time registration, the device user doesn't need to use the Company Portal app for Microsoft Entra registration and compliance checking. JIT registration and compliance remediation are embedded into the user's provisioning experience, so they can view their compliance status and take action within the work app they're trying to access. Also, this establishes single-sign on across the device. For more information about how to set up JIT registration, see [Set up Just in Time Registration](../enrollment/automated-device-enrollment-authentication.md).

#### Awaiting final configuration for iOS/iPadOS automated device enrollment now generally available<!-- 17473384  -->  
Now generally available, *awaiting final configuration* enables a locked experience at the end of Setup Assistant to ensure that critical device configuration policies install on devices. The locked experience works on devices targeted with new and existing enrollment profiles. Supported devices include:

- iOS/iPadOS 13+ devices enrolling with Setup Assistant with modern authentication
- iOS/iPadOS 13+ devices enrolling without user affinity  
- iOS/iPadOS 13+ devices enrolling with Microsoft Entra ID shared mode  

This setting is applied once during the out-of-box automated device enrollment experience in Setup Assistant. The device user doesn't experience it again unless they re-enroll their device.  Awaiting final configuration is enabled by default for new enrollment profiles. For information about how to enable awaiting final configuration, see [Create an Apple enrollment profile](..//enrollment/device-enrollment-program-enroll-ios.md#create-an-apple-enrollment-profile).

### Device management

#### Changes to Android notification permission prompt behavior<!-- 19783177  -->  
We've updated how our Android apps handle notification permissions to align with recent changes made by Google to the Android platform.  As a result of Google changes, notification permissions are granted to apps as follows:

- **On devices running Android 12 and earlier**: Apps are permitted to send notifications to users by default.
- **On devices running Android 13 and later**: Notification permissions vary depending on the API the app targets.
  - *Apps targeting API 32 and lower*: Google has added a notification permission prompt that appears when the user opens the app. Management apps can still configure apps so that they're automatically granted notification permissions.
  - *Apps targeting API 33 and higher*: App developers define when the notification permission prompts appear. Management apps can still configure apps so that they're automatically granted notification permissions.

You and your device users can expect to see the following changes now that our apps target API 33:

- **Company Portal used for work profile management**: Users see a notification permission prompt in the personal instance of the Company Portal when they first open it. Users don't see a notification permission prompt in the work profile instance of Company Portal because notification permissions are automatically permitted for Company Portal in the work profile. Users can silence app notifications in the Settings app.
- **Company Portal used for device administrator management**: Users see a notification permission prompt when they first open the Company Portal app.  Users can adjust app notification settings in the Settings app.
- **Microsoft Intune app**: No changes to existing behavior. Users don't see a prompt because notifications are automatically permitted for the Microsoft Intune app.  Users can adjust some app notification settings in the Settings app.
- **Microsoft Intune app for AOSP**: No changes to existing behavior. Users don't see a prompt because notifications are automatically permitted for the Microsoft Intune app.  Users can't adjust app notification settings in the Settings app.

### Device security

#### Defender Update controls to deploy updates for Defender is now generally available<!-- 24666660 -->  
The profile **Defender Update controls** for Intune Endpoint security Antivirus policy, which manages update settings for Microsoft Defender, is now generally available. This profile is available for the *Windows 10, Windows 11, and Windows Server* platform. While in public preview, this profile was available for the *Windows 10 and later* platform.

The profile includes settings for the rollout release channel by which devices and users receive Defender Updates that are related to daily security intelligence updates, monthly platform updates, and monthly engine updates.

This profile includes the following settings, which are all directly taken from [Defender CSP - Windows Client Management](/windows/client-management/mdm/policy-csp-Defender).

- Engine Updates Channel
- Platform Updates Channel
- Security Intelligence Updates Channel

These settings are also available from the [settings catalog](../configuration/settings-catalog.md) for the *Windows 10 and later* profile.

#### Elevation report by applications for Endpoint Privilege Management<!-- 24593324 -->  
We've released a new report named **Elevation report by applications** for Endpoint Privilege Management (EPM). With [this new report](../protect/epm-reports.md#elevation-report-by-applications) you can view all managed and unmanaged elevations, which are aggregated by the application that elevated. This report can aid you in identifying applications that might require elevation rules to function properly, including rules for child processes.

You'll find the report in the Report node for EPM in the [Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431). Navigate to **Endpoint security** > **Endpoint Privilege Management** and then select the **Reports** tab.

#### New settings available for macOS Antivirus policy<!-- 24191427 -->  
The [Microsoft Defender Antivirus](../protect/endpoint-security-antivirus-policy.md) profile for macOS devices has been updated with nine more settings, and three new settings categories:

**Antivirus engine** – The following settings are new in this category:

- **Degree of parallelism for on-demand scans** – Specifies the degree of parallelism for on-demand scans. This setting corresponds to the number of threads used to perform the scan and impacts the CPU usage, and the duration of the on-demand scan.
- **Enable file hash computation** – Enables or disables file hash computation feature. When this feature is enabled, Windows Defender computes hashes for files it scans. This setting helps improve the accuracy of Custom Indicator matches. However, enabling Enable file hash computation can impact device performance.
- **Run a scan after definitions are updated** – Specifies whether to start a process scan after new security intelligence updates are downloaded on the device. Enabling this setting triggers an antivirus scan on the running processes of the device.
- **Scanning inside archive files** – If true, Defender unpacks archives and scan files inside them. Otherwise archive content is skipped, which improves scanning performance.

**Network protection** – A new category that includes the following setting:

- **Enforcement level** – Configure this setting to specify if network protection is *disabled*, *in audit mode*, or *enforced*.

**Tamper  protection** - A new category that includes the following setting:

- **Enforcement level** - Specify whether tamper protection is *disabled*, in *audit mode*, or *enforced*.

**User interface preferences** – A new category that includes the following settings:

- **Control sign-in to consumer version** - Specify whether users can sign into the consumer version of Microsoft Defender.
- **Show / hide status menu icon** – Specify whether the status menu icon (shown in the top-right corner of the screen) is hidden or not.
- **User initiated feedback** – Specify whether users can submit feedback to Microsoft by going to *Help* > *Send Feedback*.

New profiles that you create include the original settings and the new settings. Your existing profiles automatically update to include the new settings, with each new setting set to *Not configured* until you choose to edit that profile to change it.

#### Anomaly detection device cohorts in Intune Endpoint analytics is generally available<!-- 24577118  -->  
Anomaly detection device cohorts in Intune Endpoint analytics is now generally available.

Device cohorts are identified in devices associated with a high or medium severity anomaly. Devices are correlated into groups based on one or more factors they have in common like an app version, driver update, OS version, device model. A correlation group will contain a detailed view with key information about the common factors between all affected devices in that group. You can also view a breakdown of devices currently affected by the anomaly and 'at risk' devices. "At risk" devices haven't yet shown symptoms of the anomaly.

For more information, see [Anomaly detection in Endpoint analytics](../../analytics/anomaly-detection.md#anomalies-tab).

#### Improved user experience for device timeline in Endpoint Analytics<!-- 24604944 -->  
The user interface (UI) for device timeline in Endpoint analytics is improved and includes more advanced capabilities (support for sorting, searching, filtering, and exports). When viewing a specific device timeline in Endpoint analytics, you can search by event name or details. You can also filter the events and choose the source and level of events that appear on the device timeline and select a time range of interest.

For more information, see [Enhanced device timeline](../../analytics/enhanced-device-timeline.md).

#### Updates for compliance policies and reports<!--15425771  -->  
We've made several improvements to the Intune compliance policies and reports. With these changes, the reports more closely align to the experience in use for device configuration profiles and reports. We've updated our [compliance report documentation](../protect/compliance-policy-monitor.md) to reflect the available compliance report improvements.

Compliance report improvements include:

- Compliance details for Linux devices.
- Redesigned reports that are up-to-date and simplified, with newer report versions beginning to replace older report versions, which will remain available for some time.
- When viewing a policy for compliance, there isn't a left-pane navigation. Instead, the policy view opens to a single pane that defaults to the Monitor tab and its Device status view.
  - This view provides a high-level overview of device status for this policy, supports drilling in to review the full report, and a per-setting status view of the same policy.
  - The doughnut chart is replaced by a streamlined representation and count of the different device status values returned by devices assigned the policy.
  - You can select the Properties tab to view the policy details, and review and edit its configuration and assignments.
  - The *Essentials* section is removed with those details appearing in the policy's *Properties* tab.
- The updated status reports support sorting by columns, the use of filters, and search. Combined, these enhancements enable you to pivot the report to display specific subsets of details you want to view at that time. With these enhancements, we have removed the *User status* report as it has become redundant. Now, while viewing the default *Device status* report you can focus the report to display the same information that was available from *User status* by sorting on the *User Principal Name* column, or searching for a specific username in the search box.
- When viewing status reports, the count of devices that Intune displays now remains consistent between different report views as you drill in for deeper insights or details.

For more information about these changes, see the Intune Support Team blog at [https://aka.ms/Intune/device_compl_report](https://aka.ms/Intune/device_compl_report).

### App management

#### Use the Turn off the Store application setting to disable end user access to Store apps, and allow managed Intune Store apps<!-- 16544362 -->  
In Intune, you can use the new **Store app** type to deploy Store apps to your devices.

Now, you can use the **Turn off the Store application** policy to disable end users' direct access to Store apps. When it's disabled, end users can still access and install Store apps from the Windows Company Portal app and through Intune app management. If you want to allow random store app installs outside of Intune, then don't configure this policy.

The previous **Only display the private store within the Microsoft Store app** policy doesn't prevent end users from directly accessing the store using the Windows Package Manager `winget` APIs. So, if your goal is to block random unmanaged Store application installs on client devices, then it's recommended to use the **Turn off the Store application** policy. Don't use the **Only display the private store within the Microsoft Store app** policy
.
Applies to:

- Windows 10 and later

For more information, see [Add Microsoft Store Apps to Microsoft Intune](../apps/store-apps-microsoft.md).

#### Compliance Retrieval service support for MAC address endpoints<!--  24332824  -->  
We've now added MAC address support to the Compliance Retrieval service.

The initial release of the CR service included support for using only the Intune device ID with the intent to eliminate the need to manage internal identifiers like serial numbers and MAC addresses. With this update, organizations that prefer to use MAC addresses over certificate authentication can continue to do so while implementing the CR service.

While this update adds MAC address support to the CR service, our recommendation is to use certificate-based authentication with the Intune device ID included in the certificate.

For information about the CR service as a replacement for the Intune Network Access Control (NAC) service, see the Intune blog at [https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/intune-customer-success/new-microsoft-intune-service-for-network-access-control/ba-p/2544696](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/intune-customer-success/new-microsoft-intune-service-for-network-access-control/ba-p/2544696).

### Device security

#### Tamper protection support for Windows on Azure Virtual Desktop<!--15135590  -->  
Intune now supports use of endpoint security [Antivirus policy](../protect/endpoint-security-antivirus-policy.md#prerequisites-for-tamper-protection) to manage *Tamper protection* for Windows on Azure Virtual Desktop multi-session devices. Support for Tamper protection requires devices to onboard to Microsoft Defender for Endpoint before the policy that enables Tamper protection is applied.

#### EpmTools PowerShell module for Endpoint Privilege Management<!-- 22800379  -->  
The EpmTools PowerShell module is now available for use with Intune Endpoint Privilege Management (EPM). EpmTools includes the cmdlets like **Get-FileAttributes** that you can use to retrieve file details to help build accurate elevation rules, and other cmdlets you can use to troubleshoot or diagnose EPM policy deployments.

For more information, see [EpmTools PowerShell module](../protect/epm-overview.md#epmtools-powershell-module).

#### Endpoint Privilege Management support to manage elevation rules for child processes<!-- 15931887 -->  
With Intune Endpoint Privilege Management (EPM) you can manage which files and processes are allowed to *Run as Administrator* on your Windows devices.  Now, EPM [elevation rules](../protect/epm-policies.md#windows-elevation-rules-policy) support a new setting, **Child process behavior**.

With *Child process behavior*, your rules can manage the elevation context for any child processes created by the managed process. Options include:

- Allowing all child processes created by the managed process to always run as elevated.
- Allow a child process to run as elevated only when it matches the rule that manages its parent process.
- Deny all child processes from running in an elevated context, in which case they run as standard users.

Endpoint Privilege Management is available as an Intune add-on. For more information, see [Use Intune Suite add-on capabilities](intune-add-ons.md).

We've released two new reports as a public preview for Intune device compliance. You can find these new preview reports in the Intune admin center at **Reports** > **Device compliance** > *Reports* tab:

- [Setting compliance (preview)](reports.md)
- [Policy compliance (preview)](reports.md)

Both reports are new instances of existing reports, and deliver improvements over the older versions, including:  

- Details for Linux settings and devices
- Support for sorting, searching, filtering, exports, and paging views
- Drill-down reports for deeper details, which are filtered based on the column you select.
- Devices are represented a single time. This behavior is in contrast to the original reports, which could count a device more than once if multiple users used that device.

Eventually, the [older report versions](../protect/compliance-policy-monitor.md#other-compliance-reports) that are still available in the admin center at *Devices > Monitor* will be retired.

- There isn't a **User install status** report on the **Monitor** section of the **App configuration policies** workload.
- The **Device install status** report under the **Monitor** section of the **App configuration policies** workload no longer shows the **Pending state** in the **Status** column.

You can configure policy reporting in [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431) by selecting **Apps** > **App configuration policies**.

## Week of July 3, 2023

### Device management

#### Intune support for Zebra devices on Android 13<!-- 17192763 -->  
Zebra will be releasing support for Android 13 on their devices. You can read more at [Migrating to Android 13](https://techdocs.zebra.com/lifeguard/a13/) (opens Zebra's web site).

- **Temporary issues on Android 13**

  The Intune team thoroughly tested Android 13 on Zebra devices. Everything continues working as normal, except for the following two temporary issues for device administrator (DA) devices.

  For Zebra devices running Android 13 and enrolled with DA management:

  1. App installations don't happen silently. Instead, users get a notification from the Company Portal app (if they allow notifications) that asks for permission to allow the app installation. If a user doesn't accept the app installation when prompted, then the app doesn't install. Users will have a persistent notification in the notification drawer until they allow the installation.

  2. New MX profiles don't apply to Android 13 devices. Newly enrolled Android 13 devices don't receive configuration from MX profiles. MX profiles that previously applied to enrolled devices continue to apply.

  In an update coming later in July, these issues will be resolved and the behavior will return to how it was before.

- **Update devices to Android 13**

  You'll soon be able to use Intune's Zebra LifeGuard Over-the-Air integration to update Android Enterprise dedicated and fully managed devices to Android 13. For more information, see [Zebra LifeGuard Over-the-Air Integration with Microsoft Intune](../protect/zebra-lifeguard-ota-integration.md).

  Before you migrate to Android 13, review [Migrating to Android 13](https://techdocs.zebra.com/lifeguard/a13/) (opens Zebra's web site).

- **OEMConfig for Zebra devices on Android 13**

  OEMConfig for Zebra devices on Android 13 requires using Zebra's new [Zebra OEMConfig Powered by MX OEMConfig app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.zebra.oemconfig.release) (opens the Google Play store). This new app can also be used on Zebra devices running Android 11, but not earlier versions.

  For more information on this app, go to the [New Zebra OEMConfig app for Android 11 and later](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/intune-customer-success/new-zebra-oemconfig-app-for-android-11-and-later/ba-p/3846730) blog post.

  The [Legacy Zebra OEMConfig app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.zebra.oemconfig.common) (opens the Google Play store) can only be used on Zebra devices running Android 11 and earlier.

For more general information about Intune Android 13 support, go to the [Day Zero support for Android 13 with Microsoft Intune](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/intune-customer-success/day-zero-support-for-android-13-with-microsoft-intune/ba-p/3601760) blog post.

### Device security

#### Defender for Endpoint security settings management enhancements and support for Linux and macOS in public preview<!-- 14743017, 15319901, 18713045, 18713050, 17757959 17757967, 17758270  -->  
With [Defender for Endpoint security settings management](../protect/mde-security-integration.md), you can use Intune's endpoint security policies to manage Defender security settings on devices that onboard to Defender for Endpoint but aren't enrolled with Intune.

Now, you can opt in to a public preview from within the Microsoft Defender portal to gain access to several enhancements for this scenario:

- Intune's endpoint security policies become visible in and can be managed from within the Microsoft Defender portal. This enables security admins to remain in the Defender portal to manage Defender and the Intune endpoint security policies for Defender security settings management.

- Security settings management supports deploying Intune endpoint security Antivirus policies to devices that run Linux and macOS.

- For Windows devices, the Windows Security Experience profile is now supported with security settings management.

- A new onboarding workflow removes the Microsoft Entra hybrid join prerequisite. Microsoft Entra hybrid join requirements prevented many Windows devices from successfully onboarding to Defender for Endpoint security settings management. With this change, those devices can now complete enrollment and start processing policies for security settings management.

- Intune creates a synthetic registration in Microsoft Entra ID for devices that can't fully register with Microsoft Entra ID. Synthetic registrations are device objects created in Microsoft Entra ID that enable devices to receive and report back on Intune policies for security settings management. In addition, should a device with a synthetic registration become fully registered, the synthetic registration is removed from Microsoft Entra ID in deference to the full registration.

If you don't opt in to the Defender for Endpoint Public Preview, the previous behaviors remain in place. In this case, while you can view the Antivirus profiles for Linux, you can't deploy it as its supported only for devices managed by Defender. Similarly, the macOS profile that's currently available for devices enrolled with Intune can't be deployed to devices managed by Defender.

Applies to:

- Linux
- macOS
- Windows

The **Run remediation** device action is rolling-out and can take a few weeks to reach all customers.

For more information, see [Remediations](remediations.md).

### Device management

#### Windows Driver update management in Intune is generally available<!-- 5584639  -->  
Announcing the general availability of **Windows Driver update management** in Microsoft Intune. With driver update policies, you can view a list of driver updates that are recommended and applicable to your Windows 10 and Windows 11 device that are assigned to the policy. Applicable driver updates are those that can update a device's driver version. Driver update policies update automatically to add new updates as they're published by the driver manufacturer and remove older drivers that no longer apply to any device with the policy.

Update policies can be configured for one of two approval methods:

- With *Automatic approval*, each new *recommended* driver that's published by the driver manufacturer and added to the policy is automatically approved for deployment to applicable devices. Policies set for automatic approvals can be configured with a deferral period before the automatically approved updates are installed on devices. This deferral gives you time to review the driver and to pause its deployment if necessary.

- With *manual approval*, all new driver updates are automatically added to the policy, but an admin must explicitly approve each update before Windows Update deploys it to a device. When you manually approve an update, you choose the date when Windows Update will begin to deploy it to your devices.

To help you manage driver updates, you review a policy and decline an update you don't want to install. You can also indefinitely pause any approved update, and reapprove a paused update to restart its deployment.

This release also includes [driver update reports](../protect/windows-update-reports.md#reports-for-windows-driver-updates-policy) that provide a success summary, per-device update status for each approved driver, and error and troubleshooting information. You can also select an individual driver update and view details about it across all the policies that include that driver version.

To learn about using Windows Driver update policies, see [Manage policy for Windows Driver updates with Microsoft Intune](../protect/windows-driver-updates-overview.md).

Applies to:

- Windows 10

### Device management

#### New endpoint security Application Control policy in preview<!-- 15711976 -->  
As a public preview, you can use a new endpoint security policy category, Application Control. Endpoint security Application Control policy includes:

- Policy to set the Intune Management Extension as a tenant-wide managed installer. When enabled as a managed installer, apps you deploy through Intune (after enablement of Managed Installer) to Windows devices are tagged as installed by Intune. This tag becomes useful when you use Application Control policies to manage which apps you want to allow or block from running on your managed devices.

- Application Control policies that are an implementation of Defender Application Control (WDAC). With Endpoint security Application Control policies, it's easy to configure policy that allows trusted apps to run on your managed devices. Trusted apps are installed by a managed installer or from the App store. In addition to built-in trust settings, these policies also support custom XML for application control so you can allow other apps from other sources to run to meet your organizations requirements.

To get started with using this new policy type, see [Manage approved apps for Windows devices with Application Control policy and Managed Installers for Microsoft Intune](../protect/endpoint-security-app-control-policy.md)

### Device management

#### Intune UI displays Windows Server devices as distinct from Windows clients for the Security Management for Microsoft Defender for Endpoint scenario<!-- 16882836 -->  
To support the [Security Management for Microsoft Defender for Endpoint](../protect/mde-security-integration.md) (MDE security configuration) scenario, Intune now differentiates Windows devices in Microsoft Entra ID as either *Windows Server* for devices that run Windows Server, or as *Windows* for devices that run Windows 10 or Windows 11.

With this change, you can improve policy targeting for MDE security configuration. For example, you can use dynamic groups that consist of only Windows Server devices, or only Windows client devices (Windows 10/11).

For more information about this change, see the Intune Customer Success blog [Windows Server devices now recognized as a new OS in Microsoft Intune, Microsoft Entra ID, and Defender for Endpoint
](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/intune-customer-success/support-tip-windows-server-devices-will-now-be-identified-as-a/ba-p/3767773).

### Tenant administration

#### Organizational messages for Windows 11 now generally available<!-- 15272978 -->  
Use organizational messages to deliver branded, personalized call-to-actions to employees. Select from more than 25 messages that support employees through device onboarding and lifecycle management, in 15 different languages. Messages can be assigned to Microsoft Entra user groups. They're shown just above the taskbar, in the notifications area, or in the Get started app on devices running Windows 11. Messages continue to appear or reappear based on the frequency you configure in Intune, and until the user has visited the customized URL.

Other features and functionality added in this release include:

- Confirm licensing requirements prior to first message.
- Choose from eight new themes for taskbar messages.
- Give messages a custom name.
- Add scope groups and scope tags.
- Edit the details of a scheduled message.

Scope tags were previously unavailable for organizational messages. With the addition of scope tag support, Intune adds the default scope tag to every message created before June 2023. Admins that want access to those messages must be associated with a role that has the same tag. For more information about available features and how to set up organizational messages, see
[Overview of organizational messages](../remote-actions/organizational-messages-overview.md).

#### Turn on/off Personal data encryption on Windows 11 devices using the settings catalog<!-- 10346018  -->  
The settings catalog includes hundreds of settings that you can configure and deploy to your devices.

In the settings catalog, you can turn on/off **Personal data encryption** (PDE). PDE is a security feature introduced in Windows 11 version 22H2 that provides more encryption features for Windows.

PDE is different than BitLocker. PDE encrypts individual files and content, instead of whole volumes and disks. You can use PDE with other encryption methods, such as BitLocker.

For more information on the settings catalog, see:

- [Use the settings catalog to configure settings on Windows, iOS/iPadOS and macOS devices](../configuration/settings-catalog.md)
- [Common Tasks you can complete using the Settings Catalog in Intune](../configuration/settings-catalog-common-features.md)

This feature applies to:

#### Group policy analytics supports scope tags<!-- 12714882  -->  
In Group Policy analytics, you import your on-premises GPO. The tool analyzes your GPOs and shows the settings that can (and can't) be used in Intune.

When you import your GPO XML file in Intune, you can select an existing scope tag. If you don't select a scope tag, then the **Default** scope tag is automatically selected. Previously, when you imported a GPO, the scope tags assigned to you were automatically applied to the GPO.

Only admins within that scope tag can see the imported policies. Admins not in that scope tag can't see the imported policies.

Also, admins within their scope tag can migrate the imported policies that they have permissions to see. To migrate an imported GPO into a Settings Catalog policy, a scope tag must be associated with the imported GPO. If a scope tag isn't associated, then it can't migrate to a Settings Catalog policy. If no scope tag is selected, then a default scope tag is automatically applied.

For more information on scope tags and Group Policy analytics, see:

- [Analyze your on-premises GPOs using Group Policy analytics in Microsoft Intune](../configuration/group-policy-analytics.md)

### Device enrollment

#### Account driven Apple User Enrollment available for iOS/iPadOS 15+ devices (public preview)<!-- 14161683  -->  
Intune supports account driven user enrollment, a new and improved variation of Apple User Enrollment for iOS/iPadOS 15+ devices. Now available for public preview, the new option utilizes just-in-time registration, which eliminates the need for the Company Portal app during enrollment. Device users can initiate enrollment directly in the Settings app, resulting in a shorter and more efficient onboarding experience. You can continue to target iOS/iPadOS devices using the existing profile-based user enrollment method that uses Company Portal. Devices running iOS/iPadOS, version 14.8.1 and earlier remain unaffected by this update and can continue to use the existing method.

### Device security

#### New security baseline for Microsoft 365 Office Apps<!-- 9587103  -->  
We've released a new security baseline to help you manage security configurations for **M365 Office Apps**. This new baseline uses an updated template and experience that uses the unified settings platform seen in the Intune settings catalog. You can view the list of settings in the new baseline at [Microsoft 365 Apps for Enterprise baseline settings (Office)](../protect/security-baseline-v2-office-settings.md).

The new Intune security baseline format aligns the presentation of settings that are available to the settings found in the Intune settings catalog. This alignment helps resolve past issues for setting names and implementations for settings that could create conflicts. The new format also improves the reporting experience for baselines in the Intune admin center.

The Microsoft 365 Office Apps baseline can help you rapidly deploy configurations to your Office Apps that meet the security recommendations of the Office and security teams at Microsoft. As with all baselines, the default baseline represents the recommended configurations. You can modify the default baseline to meet the requirements of your organization.

To learn more, see [Security baselines overview](../protect/security-baselines.md).

Applies to:

- Windows 10
- Windows 11

#### Security baseline update for Microsoft Edge version 112<!-- 3408610  -->  
We've released a new version of the Intune security baseline for Microsoft Edge, version 112. In addition to releasing this new version for Microsoft Edge, the new baseline uses an updated template experience that uses the unified settings platform seen in the Intune settings catalog. You can view the list of settings in the new baseline at [Microsoft Edge baseline settings (version 112 and higher)](../protect/security-baseline-v2-edge-settings.md).

The new Intune security baseline format aligns the presentation of settings that are available to the settings found in the Intune settings catalog. This alignment helps resolve past issues for setting names and implementations for settings that could create conflicts. The new format also improves the reporting experience for baselines in the Intune admin center.

Now that the new baseline version is available, all new profiles you create for Microsoft Edge use the new baseline format and version. While the new version becomes the default baseline version, you can continue to use the profiles you've previously created for older versions of Microsoft Edge. But, you can't create new profiles for those older versions of Microsoft Edge.

#### Changes to iCloud app backup and restore behavior on iOS/iPadOS and macOS devices<!-- 16261392  -->  
As an app setting, you can select to **Prevent iCloud app backup** for iOS/iPadOS and macOS devices. You can *not* backup managed App Store apps and line-of-business (LOB) apps on iOS/iPadOS, as well as managed App Store apps on macOS devices (macOS LOB apps don't support this feature), for both user and device licensed VPP/non-VPP apps. This update includes both new and existing App Store/LOB apps sent with and without VPP that are being added to Intune and targeted to users and devices.

Preventing the backup of the specified managed apps ensures that these apps can be properly deployed via Intune when the device is enrolled and restored from backup. If the admin configures this new setting for new or existing apps in their tenant, then managed apps can and will be reinstalled for devices. But, Intune doesn't allow them to be backed up.

This new setting appears in [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431) by modifying the properties of an app. For an existing app, you can select **Apps** > **iOS/iPadOS** or **macOS** > *select the app* > **Properties** > Assignment **Edit**. If no group assignment has been set, select **Add group** to add a group. Modify either the setting under **VPN**, **Uninstall on device removal**, or **Install as removable**. Then, select **Prevent iCloud app backup**. The **Prevent iCloud app backup** setting is used to prevent backup of app data for the application.

### Device management

#### Endpoint security firewall rules support for ICMP type<!-- 5653356  -->  
You can now use the **IcmpTypesAndCodes** setting to configure inbound and outbound rules for [Internet Control Message Protocol](/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-firewall/create-an-inbound-icmp-rule) (ICMP) as part of a firewall rule. This setting is available in the [*Microsoft Defender Firewall rules*](../protect/endpoint-security-firewall-policy.md#devices-managed-by-intune) profile for the *Windows 10, Windows 11, and Windows Server* platform.

Applies to:

- Windows 11 and later

#### Manage Windows LAPS with Intune policies (public preview)<!-- 11890571  -->  
Now available in a public preview, manage Windows Local Administrator Password Solution (Windows LAPS) with Microsoft Intune [Account protection policies](../protect/endpoint-security-account-protection-policy.md). To get started, see [Intune support for Windows LAPS](../protect/windows-laps-overview.md).

[Windows LAPS](/windows-server/identity/laps/laps-overview) is a Windows feature that allows you to manage and backs up the password of a local administrator account on your Microsoft Entra joined or Windows Server Active Directory-joined devices.

To manage LAPS, Intune configures the Windows [LAPS configuration service provider](/windows/client-management/mdm/LAPS-csp) (CSP) that is built in to Windows devices. It takes precedence over other sources of Windows LAPS configurations, like GPOs or the Microsoft Legacy LAPS tool. Some of the capabilities you can use when Intune manages Windows LAPS include:

- Define password requirements like complexity and length that apply to the local administrator accounts on a device.
- Configure devices to rotate their local admin account passwords on a schedule. And, back up the account and password in your Microsoft Entra ID or on-premises Active Directory.
- Use an Intune device action from the admin center to manually rotate the password for an account on your own schedule.
- View account details from within the Intune admin center, like the account name and password. This information can help you recover devices that are otherwise inaccessible.
- Use Intune reports to monitor your LAPS policies, and when devices last rotated passwords manually or by schedule.  

Applies to:

- Windows 10
- Windows 11

#### New settings available for macOS software update policies<!-- 16646756  -->

- **Max User Deferrals**:  When the *All other updates* update type is configured to *Install later*, this setting allows you to specify the maximum number of times a user can postpone a minor OS update before it's installed. The system prompts the user once a day. Available for devices running macOS 12 and later.

- **Priority**: When the *All other updates* update type is configured to *Install later*, this setting allows you to specify values of *Low* or *High* for the scheduling priority for downloading and preparing minor OS updates. Available for devices running macOS 12.3 and later.

For more information, see [Use Microsoft Intune policies to manage macOS software updates](../protect/software-updates-macos.md).

The Microsoft Surface link takes you to the Surface Management Portal where you can get insights into device compliance, support activity, and warranty coverage.

To access the Partner portals page, you must enable the Devices pane preview and then navigate to **Devices** > **Partner Portals**.

#### Windows Update compatibility reports for Apps and Drivers are now generally available<!-- 17917026  -->  
The following Microsoft Intune reports for [Windows Update compatibility](../protect/windows-update-compatibility-reports.md) are out of preview and now generally available:

- **Windows feature update device readiness report** - This report provides per-device information about compatibility risks that are associated with an upgrade or update to a chosen version of Windows.

- **Windows feature update compatibility risks report** - This report provides a summary view of the top compatibility risks across your organization for a chosen version of Windows. You can use this report to understand which compatibility risks impact the greatest number of devices in your organization.

These reports can help you plan an upgrade from Windows 10 to 11, or for installing the latest Windows feature update.

### Device security

#### Microsoft Intune Endpoint Privilege Management is generally available<!--1564177  -->  
Microsoft Endpoint Privilege Management (EPM) is now generally available and no longer in preview.

With [Endpoint Privilege Management](../protect/epm-overview.md), admins can set policies that allow standard users to perform tasks normally reserved for an administrator. To do so, you configure policies for *automatic* and *user-confirmed* workflows that elevate the run-time permissions for apps or processes you select. You then assign these policies to users or devices that have end users running without Administrator privileges. After the device receives a policy, EPM brokers the elevation on behalf of the user, allowing them to elevate approved applications without needing full administrator privileges. EPM also includes built-in insights and reporting.

Now that EPM is out of preview, it requires another license to use. You can choose between a stand-alone license that adds only EPM, or license EPM as part of the Microsoft Intune Suite. For more information, see [Use Intune Suite add-on capabilities](intune-add-ons.md).

While Endpoint Privilege Management is now generally available, the [reports for EPM](../protect/epm-reports.md) will transition to a feature in *preview*, and will receive some more enhancements before being removed from preview.

#### Support for WDAC Application ID tagging with Intune Firewall Rules policy<!-- 17224780  -->  
Intune's *Microsoft Defender Firewall Rules* profiles, which are available as part of [endpoint security Firewall policy](../protect/endpoint-security-firewall-policy.md), now include the Policy App ID setting. This setting is described in the [*MdmStore/FirewallRules/{FirewallRuleName}/PolicyAppId*](/windows/client-management/mdm/Firewall-csp?WT.mc_id=Portal-fx#mdmstorefirewallrulesfirewallrulenamepolicyappid) CSP and supports specifying a Windows Defender Application Control (WDAC) Application ID tag.

With this capability, you can scope your firewall rules to an application or a group of applications and rely on your WDAC policies to define those applications. By using tags to link to and rely on WDAC policies, your Firewall Rules policy won't need to rely on the firewall rules option of an absolute file path, or use of a variable file path that can reduce security of the rule.

Use of this capability requires you to have WDAC policies in place that include *AppId* tags that you can then specify in your Intune Microsoft Defender Firewall Rules.

For more information, see the following articles in the Windows Defender Application Control documentation:

- [About application control for Windows](/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-defender-application-control/windows-defender-application-control)
- [WDAC Application ID (AppId) Tagging guide](/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-defender-application-control/appidtagging/windows-defender-application-control-appid-tagging-guide)

Applies to:

- Windows 10/11

#### New App and browser isolation profile for Intune's endpoint security Attack Surface Reduction policy<!-- 17392386  -->  
We have released a new experience creating new *App and Browser Isolation* profiles for endpoint security Attack Surface Reduction policy. The experience for editing your previously created App and Browser isolation policies remains the same, and you can continue to use them. This update applies only for the new [App and Browser Isolation](../protect/endpoint-security-asr-policy.md#attack-surface-reduction-profiles) policies you create for the *Windows 10 and later* platform.

This update is part of the continuing rollout of new profiles for endpoint security policies, which began in April 2022.

Additionally, the new profile includes the following changes for the settings it includes:

- **Block external content from non-enterprise approved sites** - This setting is removed from the updated profile as it was supported only by Microsoft Edge Legacy. Microsoft Edge Legacy support ended in March 2021. [Microsoft 365 apps say farewell to Internet Explorer 11 and Windows 10 sunsets Microsoft Edge Legacy - Microsoft Community Hub](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-365-blog/microsoft-365-apps-say-farewell-to-internet-explorer-11-and/ba-p/1591666).

- **Clipboard file type** – This setting is added to the updated profile and determines the type of content that can be copied from the host to Application Guard environment and vice versa. You can view the CSP for this new setting at [Settings/ClipboardFileType](/windows/client-management/mdm/windowsdefenderapplicationguard-csp#settingsclipboardfiletype) in the WindowsDefenderApplicationGuard CSP documentation.

### App management

#### Trusted Root Certificates Management for Intune App SDK for Android<!-- 15135752 -->  
If your Android application requires SSL/TLS certificates issued by an on-premises or private certificate authority to provide secure access to internal websites and applications, the Intune App SDK for Android now has support for certificate trust management. For more information and examples, see [Trusted Root Certificates Management](../developer/app-sdk-android-phase7.md#trusted-root-certificates-management).

#### System context support for UWP apps<!-- 16544103 -->  
In addition to user context, you can deploy Universal Windows Platform (UWP) apps from the **Microsoft Store app (new)** in system context. If a provisioned *.appx* app is deployed in system context, the app auto-installs for each user that logs in. If an individual end user uninstalls the user context app, the app still shows as installed because it's still provisioned. In addition, the app must not already be installed for any users on the device. Our general recommendation is to not mix install contexts when deploying apps. Win32 apps from the **Microsoft Store app (new)** already support system context.

## Week of December 12, 2022 (Service release 2212)

### Device configuration

#### Remote Help client app includes a new option to disable chat functionality in the Tenant level setting<!-- 14685052 -->  
In the Remote Help app, admins can disable chat functionality from the new tenant level setting. Turning on the disable chat feature removes the chat button in the Remote Help app. This setting can be found in the Remote Help **Settings** tab under **Tenant Administration** in Microsoft Intune.

For more information, see [Configure Remote Help for your tenant](remote-help.md#configure-remote-help-for-your-tenant).

**Applies to**: Windows 10/11

#### New settings available in the macOS Settings Catalog<!-- 16069006 -->  
The [Settings Catalog](../configuration/settings-catalog.md) lists all the settings you can configure in a device policy, and all in one place.

New settings are available in the Settings Catalog. In the [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431), you can see these settings at **Devices** > **Manage devices** > **Configuration** > **Create** > **New policy** > **macOS** for platform > **Settings catalog** for profile type.

New settings include:

**File Vault > File Vault Options**:

- Block FV From Being Disabled
- Block FV From Being Enabled

**Restrictions**:

- Allow Bluetooth Modification

Applies to:

- macOS

For more information about configuring Settings Catalog profiles in Intune, see [Create a policy using settings catalog](../configuration/settings-catalog.md).

#### There are default settings for SSO extension requests on iOS, iPadOS, and macOS devices<!-- 15082414-15084030 -->
When you create a single sign-on app extension configuration profile, there are some settings that you configure. The following settings use the following default values for all SSO extension requests:

- **AppPrefixAllowList** key
  - macOS default value: `com.microsoft.,com.apple.`
  - iOS/iPadOS default value: `com.apple.`

- **browser_sso_interaction_enabled** key
  - macOS default value: `1`
  - iOS/iPadOS default value: `1`

- **disable_explicit_app_prompt** key
  - macOS default value: `1`
  - iOS/iPadOS default value: `1`

If you configure a value other than the default value, then the configured value overwrites the default value.

For example, you don't configure the `AppPrefixAllowList` key. By default, all Microsoft apps (`com.microsoft.`) and all Apple apps (`com.apple.`) are enabled for SSO on macOS devices. You can overwrite this behavior by adding a different prefix to the list, such as `com.contoso.`.

For more information on the Enterprise SSO plug-in, go to [Use the Microsoft Enterprise SSO plug-in on iOS/iPadOS and macOS devices in Microsoft Intune](../configuration/use-enterprise-sso-plug-in-ios-ipados-macos.md).

### App management

#### Microsoft Store apps in Intune<!-- 12708346 -->  
You can now search, browse, configure, and deploy Microsoft Store apps within Intune. The new Microsoft Store app type is implemented using the Windows Package Manager. This app type features an expanded catalog of apps, which includes both UWP apps and Win32 apps. Roll out of this feature is expected to complete by December 2, 2022. For more information, see [Add Microsoft Store apps to Microsoft Intune](../apps/store-apps-microsoft.md).

### Tenant administration

#### Access policies for multiple Administrator Approval (public preview)<!-- 9348867  -->  
In public preview, you can use Intune *access policies* to require that a second Administrator Approval account approve a change before the change is applied. This capability is known as multiple Administrator Approval (MAA).

You create an access policy to protect a type of resource, like App deployments. Each access policy also includes a group of users who are *approvers* for the changes protected by the policy. When a resource, like an app deployment configuration, is protected by an access policy, any changes that made to the deployment, including creating, deleting, or modifying an existing deployment, won't apply until a member of the approvers group for that access policy reviews and approves that change.

Approvers can also reject requests. The individual requesting a change and the approver can provide notes about the change, or why it was approved or rejected.

Access policies are supported for the following resources:

- **Apps** – Applies to [app deployments](../apps/apps-add.md), but doesn't apply to app protection policies.
- **Scripts** – Applies to deploying scripts to devices that run [macOS](../apps/macos-shell-scripts.md) or [Windows](../apps/intune-management-extension.md).

For more information, see [Use Access policies to require multiple administrative approval](multi-admin-approval.md).

### Device security

#### Microsoft Tunnel for Mobile Application Management for Android (Preview)<!-- 15769204 -->  
As a public preview, you can now use Microsoft Tunnel with unenrolled devices. This capability is called [Microsoft Tunnel for Mobile Application Management](../protect/microsoft-tunnel-mam.md) (MAM). This preview supports Android, and without any changes to your existing Tunnel infrastructure, supports the Tunnel VPN gateway for:

- Secure access to on-premises apps and resources using modern authentication
- Single Sign On and conditional access

To use Tunnel MAM, unenrolled devices must install Microsoft Edge, Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, and the Company Portal. You can then use the Microsoft Intune admin center to configure the following profiles for the unenrolled devices:

- An App configuration profile for managed apps, to configure Microsoft Defender on devices for use as the Tunnel client app.
- A second App configuration profile for managed apps, to configure Microsoft Edge to connect to Tunnel.
- An App protection profile to enable automatic start of the Microsoft Tunnel connection.

Applies to:

- Android Enterprise

### App management

#### Control the display of Managed Google Play apps<!-- 621615   -->  
You can group Managed Google Play apps into collections and control the order that collections are displayed when selecting apps in Intune. You can also make apps visible via search only. This capability is available in [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431) by selecting **Apps** > **All apps** > **Add** > **Managed Google Play app**. For more information, see [Add a Managed Google Play store app directly in the Intune admin center](../apps/apps-add-android-for-work.md#add-a-managed-google-play-store-app-directly-in-the-microsoft-intune-admin-center).

### Device configuration

#### New password complexity setting for Android Enterprise 12+ personally owned devices with a work profile<!-- 12436068  -->  
On Android Enterprise 11 and older personally owned devices with a work profile, you can set the following password settings:

- **Devices** > **Compliance** > **Android Enterprise** for platform > **Personally owned work profile** > **System security** > **Required password type**, **Minimum password length**
- **Devices** > **Manage devices** > **Configuration** > **Android Enterprise** for platform > **Personally owned work profile** > **Device restrictions** > **Work profile settings** > **Required password type**, **Minimum password length**
- **Devices** > **Manage devices** > **Configuration** > **Android Enterprise** for platform > **Personally owned work profile** > **Device restrictions** > **Password** > **Required password type**, **Minimum password length**

Google is deprecating the **Required password type** and **Minimum password length** settings for Android 12+ personally owned devices with a work profile and replacing them with new password complexity requirements. For more information about this change, go to [Day zero support for Android 13](https://aka.ms/Intune/Android13).

The new **Password complexity** setting has the following options:

- **None**: Intune doesn't change or update this setting. By default, the OS might not require a password.
- **Low**: Pattern or PIN with repeating (4444) or ordered (1234, 4321, 2468) sequences are blocked.
- **Medium**: PIN with repeating (4444) or ordered (1234, 4321, 2468) sequences are blocked. The length, alphabetic length, or alphanumeric length must be at least four characters.
- **High**: PIN with repeating (4444) or ordered (1234, 4321, 2468) sequences are blocked. The length must be at least eight characters. The alphabetic or alphanumeric length must be at least six characters.

On Android 12+, if you currently use the **Required password type** and **Minimum password length** settings in a compliance policy or device configuration profile, then we recommend using the new **Password complexity** setting instead.

If you continue to use the **Required password type** and **Minimum password length** settings, and don't configure the **Password complexity** setting, then new devices running Android 12+ might default to the **High** password complexity.

For more information on these settings and what happens to existing devices with the deprecated settings configured, go to:

- [Android Enterprise personally owned devices with a work profile - configuration profile settings list](../configuration/device-restrictions-android-enterprise-personal.md)

### App management

#### Use filters with app configuration policies for managed devices<!-- 7423842  -->  
You can use filters to refine the assignment scope when deploying app configuration policies for managed devices. You must first [create a filter](filters.md#create-a-filter) using any of the available properties for iOS and Android. Then, in [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431) you can assign your managed app configuration policy by selecting **Apps** > **App configuration policies** > **Add** > **Managed devices** and go to the assignment page. After selecting a group, you can refine the applicability of the policy by choosing a filter and deciding to use it in **Include** or **Exclude** mode. For related information about filters, see [Use filters when assigning your apps, policies, and profiles in Microsoft Intune admin center](filters.md).

### Device configuration

#### Group Policy analytics automatically applies scope tags assigned to admins when they import Group Policy objects<!-- 16017499 -->  
In Group Policy analytics, you can import your on-premises GPOs to see the policy settings that support cloud-based MDM providers, including Microsoft Intune. You can also see any deprecated settings or settings not available.

Now, scope tags assigned to admins are automatically applied when these admins import GPOs into Group Policy analytics.

For example, admins have **Charlotte**, **London**, or **Boston** scope tags assigned to their role:

- An admin with the **Charlotte** scope tag imports a GPO. 
- The **Charlotte** scope tag is automatically applied to the imported GPO.
- All admins with the **Charlotte** scope tag can see the imported object.
- Admins with only the **London** or only the **Boston** scope tags can't see the imported object from the **Charlotte** admin.

For admins to see the analytics or migrate the imported GPO to an Intune policy, these admins must have one of the same scope tags as the admin that did the import.

For more information on these features, go to:

- [Analyze your on-premises GPOs using Group Policy analytics in Microsoft Intune](../configuration/group-policy-analytics.md)

The reusable groups are collections of remote IP addresses and FQDNs that you define one time and can then use with one or more firewall rule profiles. You don't need to reconfigure the same group of IP addresses in each individual profile that might require them.

Features of the reusable settings groups include:

- Add one or more remote IP addresses.

- Add one or more FQDNs that can auto resolve to the remote IP address, or for one or more simple keywords when auto resolve for the group is off.

- Use each settings group with one or more firewall rule profiles and the different  profiles can support different access configurations for the group.

  For example, you can create two firewall rule profiles that reference the same reusable settings group and assign each profile to a different group of devices. The first profile can block access to all the remote IP addresses in the reusable settings group, while the second profile can be configured to allow access.

- Edits to a settings group that's in use are automatically applied to all Firewall Rules profiles that use that group.  

#### Attack surface reduction rule exclusions on a per-rule basis<!-- 13385644   -->  
You can now [configure per-rule exclusions for Attack surface reduction rules policies](../protect/endpoint-security-asr-policy.md#exclusions-for-attack-surface-reduction-rules). Per-rule exclusions are enabled through a new per-rule setting **ASR Only Per Rule Exclusions**.

When you create or edit attack surface reduction rule policies and change a setting that supports exclusions from the default of *Not configured* to any of the other available options, the new per-setting exclusion option becomes available. Any configurations for that setting instance of *ASR Only Per Rule Exclusions* apply to only that setting.

You can continue to configure global exclusions that apply to all attack surface reduction rules on the device
by using the setting **Attack Surface Reduction Only Exclusions**.

Applies to:

- Windows 10/11

> [!NOTE]  
> ASR policies don't support merge functionality for *ASR Only Per Rule Exclusions* and a policy conflict can result when multiple policies that configure *ASR Only Per Rule Exclusions* for the same device conflict. To avoid conflicts, combine the configurations for *ASR Only Per Rule Exclusions* into a single ASR policy. We are investigating adding policy merge for *ASR Only Per Rule Exclusions* in a future update.

#### Grant apps permission to silently use certificates on Android Enterprise devices<!-- 12441244    -->  
You can now configure silent use of certificates by apps on Android Enterprise devices that enrolled as **Fully Managed, Dedicated, and Corporate-Owned work Profile**.

This capability is available on a new **Apps** page in the certificate profile configuration workflow by setting **Certificate access** to  **Grant silently for specific apps (require user approval for other apps)**.  With this configuration, the apps you then select silently use the certificate. All other apps continue to use the default behavior, which is to require user approval.

This capability supports the following certificate profiles for only Android Enterprise Fully Managed, Dedicated, and Corporate-Owned work Profiles:

- [Derived credentials](../protect/derived-credentials.md#use-derived-credentials-for-app-authentication)
- [Imported PKCS](../protect/certificates-imported-pfx-configure.md#create-a-pkcs-imported-certificate-profile)

### App management

#### New app types for Microsoft Intune<!-- 7210233 -->
As an admin, you can create and assign two new types of Intune apps:
- **iOS/iPadOS web clip** 
- **Windows web link**

These new app types work in a similar way to the existing **web link** application type, however they apply only for their specific platform, whereas web link applications apply across all platforms. With these new app types, you can assign to groups and also use assignment filters to limit the scope of assignment. This functionality is in the [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431) > **Apps** > **All Apps** > **Add**.

### Device management

#### Microsoft Intune is ending support for Windows 8.1<!-- 14740233 -->
Microsoft Intune is ending support on October 21, 2022 for devices running Windows 8.1. After that date, technical assistance and automatic updates that help protect your devices running Windows 8.1 will no longer be available. Also, because the sideloading scenario for line-of-business apps is only applicable to Windows 8.1 devices, Intune no longer supports Windows 8.1 sideloading. Sideloading is installing, and then running or testing an app that isn't cerified by the Microsoft Store. In Windows 10/11, "sideloading" is simply setting a device config policy to include "Trusted app installation". 

#### Group member count visible in assignments<!-- 13434676 -->
When assigning policies in the admin center, you can now see the number of users and devices in a group. Having both counts help you pinpoint the right group and understand the impact the assignment has before you apply it.

### Device configuration

#### New lock screen message when adding custom support information to Android Enterprise devices<!-- 13158348 -->
On Android Enterprise devices, you can create a device restrictions configuration profile that shows a custom support message on the devices (**Devices** > **Manage devices** > **Configuration** > **Create** > **New policy** > **Android Enterprise** > **Fully managed, dedicated, and corporate-owned work profile** for platform > **Device restrictions** for profile type > **Custom support information**).

There's a new setting you can configure:
- **Lock screen message**: Add a message that's shown on the device lock screen. 

When you configure the **Lock screen message**, you can also use the following device tokens to show device-specific information:
- `{{AADDeviceId}}`: Microsoft Entra device ID
- `{{AccountId}}`: Intune tenant ID or account ID
- `{{DeviceId}}`: Intune device ID
- `{{DeviceName}}`: Intune device name
- `{{domain}}`: Domain name
- `{{EASID}}`: Exchange Active Sync ID
- `{{IMEI}}`: IMEI of the device
- `{{mail}}`: Email address of the user
- `{{MEID}}`: MEID of the device
- `{{partialUPN}}`: UPN prefix before the `@` symbol
- `{{SerialNumber}}`: Device serial number
- `{{SerialNumberLast4Digits}}`: Last four digits of the device serial number
- `{{UserId}}`: Intune user ID
- `{{UserName}}`: User name
- `{{userPrincipalName}}`: UPN of the user

> [!NOTE]
> Variables aren't validated in the UI and are case sensitive. As a result, you might see profiles saved with incorrect input. For example, if you enter `{{DeviceID}}`, instead of `{{deviceid}}` or `{{DEVICEID}}`, then the literal string is shown instead of the device's unique ID. Be sure to enter the correct information. All lowercase or all uppercase variables are supported, but not a mix.

For more information on this setting, go to [Android Enterprise device settings to allow or restrict features using Intune](../configuration/device-restrictions-android-for-work.md#custom-support-information).
