# US government endpoints for Microsoft Intune

This page lists the US Government, US Government Community (GCC) High, and Department of Defense (DoD) endpoints needed for proxy settings in your Intune deployments.

To manage devices behind firewalls and proxy servers, you must enable communication for Intune.

- The proxy server must support both **HTTP (80)** and **HTTPS (443)** because Intune clients use both protocols
- For some tasks (like downloading software updates), Intune requires unauthenticated proxy server access to manage.microsoft.us

You can modify proxy server settings on individual client computers. You can also use Group Policy settings to change settings for all client computers located behind a specified proxy server.

Managed devices require configurations that let **All Users** access services through firewalls.

> [!NOTE]
> The inspection of SSL traffic is not supported on 'manage.microsoft.us', or 'has.spserv.microsoft.com' endpoint.

For more information about Windows 10 auto-enrollment and device registration for US government customers, see [Set up automatic enrollment for Windows](../enrollment/windows-enroll.md).  

The following tables list the ports and services that the Intune client accesses:

| Endpoint | IP address |
|---------------------|-----------|
|*.manage.microsoft.us | 52.227.99.114 <br> 20.141.108.112 <br> 13.72.17.166 <br> 52.126.185.115 <br> 52.227.211.91 <br> 23.97.10.212 <br> 52.227.29.124 <br> 52.247.174.16 <br> 52.227.29.244 <br> 52.227.208.144 <br> 52.227.1.233 <br> 20.141.104.221 <br> 52.247.134.218 <br> 20.141.78.227 <br> 13.77.236.201  |
| enterpriseregistration.microsoftonline.us | 13.72.188.239 <br> 13.72.55.179 |

## US Government customer designated endpoints:
- Azure portal: https:\//portal.azure.us/ 
- Microsoft 365: https:\//portal.office365.us/ 
- Intune Company Portal: https:\//portal.manage.microsoft.us/ 
- Microsoft Intune admin center: https:\//intune.microsoft.us/
## Network requirements for PowerShell scripts and Win32 apps  

If you're using Intune to deploy PowerShell scripts or Win32 apps, you'll also need to grant access to endpoints in which your tenant currently resides.
