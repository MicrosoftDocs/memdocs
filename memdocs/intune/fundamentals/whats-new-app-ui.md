# UI updates for Intune end-user apps  

Learn about the most recent updates to the Microsoft Intune apps. We regularly add to and improve the Intune Company Portal app and website. If you're an Intune administrator or support person, this article provides the information you need to:

* Alert students and employees to app and enrollment changes.
* Update your organization's documentation or helpdesk procedures.  

If you're an employee or student, be sure to check out the screenshots and links to the Company Portal help documentation. For more information about how to use the Company Portal app, see the [Company Portal user help documentation](../user-help/use-managed-devices-to-get-work-done.md).

### Improvements to work profile messaging in Company Portal for Android<!--8378333 wnready -->  

We've updated messaging in Company Portal for Android to better introduce and explain how work profile works. After the work profile setup flow, users see a new informational screen explaining where to find work apps, with links to help documentation.   

 > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
 > ![Screenshot of Company Portal **Your new work setup** screen.](./media/whats-new-app-ui/new-work-profile-company-portal-2011.png)  

When a user accidentally re-enables the Company Portal app in the personal profile, they'll see a screen (formerly **Your device now has a profile just for work**) that guides them to their work apps, with links to help documentation.

When they swipe right, they'll learn how to get more work apps from the Google Play Store.  `

## Week of September 28, 2020  

### Improved work profile messaging in Company Portal for Android  
The Company Portal screen previously titled "You're Halfway There!" has been updated to better explain how work profile management works. Users will see this screen if they re-enable Company Portal in the personal profile after they've already gone through work profile enrollment. They may also see this screen during work profile enrollment on some Android OS versions, as shown in the help doc, [Enroll with Android work profile](../user-help/enroll-device-android-work-profile.md).

## Week of August 10, 2020

### Improvement to Update device settings page in Company Portal app for Android to shows descriptions<!-- 7414768 -->

In the Company Portal app on Android devices, the **Update device settings** page lists the settings that need updated to be compliant. Users expand the issue to see more information, and see the **Resolve** button.

This user experience is improved. The listed settings are expanded by default to show the description, and show the **Resolve** button, when applicable. Previously, the issues were collapsed by default. This new default behavior reduces the number of clicks, so users can resolve issues more quickly.

## Week of June 8, 2020 

### Updates to informational screen in Company Portal for iOS/iPadOS <!-- 7032452 -->
We've updated an informational screen in Company Portal for iOS/iPadOS to better explain what an admin can see and do on devices. These clarifications are only about corporate-owned devices. Only the text has been updated, no actual modifications have been made to what the admin can see or do on user devices. To learn more about what's visible to an admin, see [What information can my organization see when I enroll my device?](../user-help/what-info-can-your-company-see-when-you-enroll-your-device-in-intune.md)

### Company Portal for Android guides users to get apps after work profile enrollment <!-- 6103999 -->
We've improved the in-app guidance in Company Portal to make it easier for users to find and install apps. After they enroll in work profile management, users will get a message explaining how to find suggested apps in the badged version of Google Play. The last step in [Enroll device with Android profile](../user-help/enroll-device-android-work-profile.md) has been updated to show the new message. 

![Example image of Company Portal, Devices tab prompt to open badged version of Google Play.](./media/whats-new-app-ui/updated-banner-android-2005.png)  

Users will also see a new **Get Apps** link in the Company Portal drawer on the left.

### Improvements to device setup workflow in the Company Portal for iOS in version 2.9.0 <!-- 1417174 -->

We've improved the device setup workflow in the Company Portal app for iOS/iPadOS. The language is more user-friendly and we've combined screens where possible. We have also made the language more specific to your company by using your company name throughout the setup text.

> [!NOTE]
> We use the company name you have set in the Azure Portal in **Microsoft Intune** > **Client Apps** > **Company Portal branding** > **Company name**. If you have not set this value, we will use the tenant name set in **Azure Active Directory** > **Properties** > **Name**. If you have not set a company name in Company Portal branding and don't want your tenant name to be displayed, we recommend that you set the company name in the Company Portal branding tab. If you don't want this string to show in the header in Company Portal, you can deselect the checkbox to "Show company name next to logo."

## August 2017

### iOS 11 Mail app will support OAuth <!-- 1196951 -->

Conditional Access with Intune supports more secure authentication on iOS devices with OAuth. To support this, there will now be a different flow on the Company Portal app for iOS to allow for more secure authentication. When end users try to sign in to a new Exchange account in the Mail app, they will see a web view prompt. Upon enrollment in Intune, users will see a prompt to allow the native Mail app to access a certificate. Most end users will not see any more quarantined emails. Existing mail accounts will continue to use basic authentication protocol, so these users will still have quarantine emails delivered to them. This sign in experience for end users is similar to the one on Office mobile apps.

### Improved sign in experience across Company Portal apps for all platforms <!--User Story 1132123-->

We are announcing a change that is coming in the next few months that will improve the sign-in experience for the Intune Company Portal apps for Android, iOS/iPadOS, and Windows. The new user experience will automatically appear across all platforms for the Company Portal app when Azure AD makes this change. In addition, users can now sign in to the Company Portal from another device with a generated, single-use code. This is especially useful in cases when users need to sign in without credentials.  

Below you can see the previous sign-in experience, the new sign-in experience with credentials, and the new sign-in experience from another device.

## June 2017

### Company Portal app for Android now has a new end-user experience for App Protection Policies
Based on customer feedback, we've modified the Company Portal app for Android to show an **Access Company Content** button. The intent is to prevent end users from unnecessarily going through the enrollment process when they only need to access apps that support App Protection Policies, a feature of Intune mobile application management.

The user will tap on the **Access Company Content** button instead of beginning to enroll the device.

![An image of the Android Company Portal app, which shows in large text "Access Company Content" in the middle rather than offering immediate enrollment options as is the standard case](./media/whats-new-app-ui/and_access_company_content_after_1706.png)

The user then is taken to the Company Portal website to authorize the app for use on their device, where the Company Portal website verifies their credentials.

![An image of the Company Portal website, confirming the sign-in.](./media/whats-new-app-ui/and_iwp_sign_in_auth_page_after_1706.png)

The device can still be enrolled into full management by tapping on the **action** menu.

![An image of the Company Portal app for Android, showing the menu from the top right corner of the screen with an option to still enroll the device.](./media/whats-new-app-ui/and_sign_in_menu_after_app_protection_policy_enrolled_after_1706.png)

### Improvements to app syncing with Windows 10 Creators Update <!--676505-->

The Company Portal app for Windows 10 will now automatically initiate a sync for app install requests for devices with Windows 10 Creators Update (version 1709). This will reduce the issue of app installs stalling during the "Pending Sync" state. In addition, users will be able to manually initiate a sync from within the app.

![An image of the Windows 10 Company Portal app, where the download of Microsoft Word is in a pending state from the Company Portal's app store.](./media/whats-new-app-ui/w10_download_pending_after_1706.png)

### New guided experience for Windows 10 Company Portal <!---1058938--->
The Company Portal app for Windows 10 will include a guided Intune walkthrough experience for devices that have not been identified or enrolled. The new experience provides step-by-step instructions that guide the user through registering into Azure Active Directory (required for Conditional Access features) and MDM enrollment (required for device management features). The guided experience will be accessible from the Company Portal home page. Users can continue to use the app if they do not complete registration and enrollment, but will experience limited functionality.

This update is only visible on devices running Windows 10 Anniversary Update (build 1607) or higher.

![An image of the Windows 10 Company Portal app landing page, with a status message in the middle in the "devices" list which is telling a user that the device they're on hasn't been set up for corporate use yet, and that the user should select the message to begin setup.](./media/whats-new-app-ui/win10_guided_enroll_select_setup_after_1706.png)

### New menu action to easily remove Company Portal <!--1164569-->
Based on user feedback, the Company Portal app for Android has added a new menu action to initiate the removal of Company Portal from your device. This action removes the device from Intune management so that the app can be removed from the device by the user.

![An image of the Android Company Portal app, with the action menu opened in the top right corner. The new "remove company portal" option is available as the third option, underneath "my profile" and "settings", and above "terms and conditions", "help and feedback", and "about".](./media/whats-new-app-ui/android_remove_cp_menu_action_after_1705.png)

![An image of the confirmation dialog, that is available after selecting the new "remove company portal" option from the action menu.

It then asks the user to confirm that they want to remove the Company Portal app by selecting "Yes".](./media/whats-new-app-ui/android_remove_cp_menu_confirmation_after_1705.png)

### Improvements to the app tiles in the Company Portal app for iOS <!--1230777-->

## January 2017

### Modernizing the Company Portal website <!--753980, announced 1701-->
Beginning in February, the Company Portal website will support apps that are targeted to users who do not have managed devices. The website will align with other Microsoft products and services by using a new contrasting color scheme, dynamic illustrations, and a "hamburger menu," ![Small image of the hamburger menu that is now added at the top left corner of the Company Portal website](./media/whats-new-app-ui/CP_hamburger_menu.png) which will contain helpdesk contact details and information on existing managed devices. The landing page will be rearranged to emphasize apps that are available to users, with carousels for Featured and Recently Updated apps.
