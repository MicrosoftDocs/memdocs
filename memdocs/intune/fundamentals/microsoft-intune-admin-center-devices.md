Enroll devices, manage profiles and policies, and access monitoring and reports all in one place in Microsoft Intune. Now in public preview, you can go to the **Devices** area in the Microsoft Intune admin center to:

* Get at-a-glance actionable information and key metrics about your devices.  
* Access workloads for device onboarding, management, and monitoring.
* View, monitor, and drill down into active issues on the Overview page.
* Manage devices by OS platform.
* Access, apply, and view filters at the top of every list view.  

This article describes how to opt in to the public preview and access these updated workloads:

* **Devices** > **Overview**
* **Devices** > **All devices**  
* **Devices** > **Configuration**
* **Devices** > **Compliance**
* **Devices** > **Windows 10 and later updates**

## Opt in to public preview  

You can switch back and forth between the current UI and public preview without impacting other admins in your tenant. To try the new Devices experience, sign in to the [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431) and go to **Devices** > **Overview**. Select the notification banner that says **Preview upcoming changes to Devices and provide feedback**. Then select **Try it now** to opt in.

You remain in public preview even if you close the browser. To exit public preview and return to the current version of the admin center, flip the switch next to **Use Devices preview**.  Wait while Intune refreshes the UI.
