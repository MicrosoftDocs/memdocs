# Tutorial: Walkthrough Microsoft Intune admin center

Microsoft Intune provides the cloud infrastructure, the cloud-based mobile device management (MDM), cloud-based mobile application management (MAM), and cloud-based PC management for your organization. Intune helps you ensure that your company's devices, apps, and data meet your company's security requirements. You have the control to set which requirements need to be checked and what happens when those requirements aren't met. The [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431) is where you can find the Microsoft Intune service, as well as other device management related settings. Understanding the features available in Intune will help you accomplish various Mobile Device Management (MDM) and Mobile Application Management (MAM) tasks.

## Tour Microsoft Intune in the Microsoft Intune admin center

Follow the steps below to better understand Intune in the Microsoft Intune admin center. Once you complete the tour, you'll have a better understanding of some of the major areas of Intune.

1. Open a browser and sign in to the [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431). If you are new to Intune, use your free trial subscription.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/tutorial-walkthrough-endpoint-manager/tutorial-walkthrough-mem-01.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Microsoft Intune admin center - Home page." lightbox="./media/tutorial-walkthrough-endpoint-manager/tutorial-walkthrough-mem-01.png":::

    When you open the Microsoft Intune admin center, the service is displayed in a pane of your browser. Some of the first workloads you may use in Intune include **Devices**, **Apps**, **Users**, and **Groups**. A workload is simply a sub-area of a service. When you select the workload, it opens that pane as a full page. Other panes slide out from the right side of the pane when they open, and close to reveal the previous pane. 

    By default, when you open the Microsoft Intune admin center, you'll see the **Home page** pane. This pane provides an overall visual snapshot of tenant status and compliance status, as well as other helpful related links.

2. From the navigation pane, select **Dashboard** to display overall details about the devices and apps for your Intune tenant. If you are starting with a new Intune tenant, you won't have any enrolled devices or added apps yet.

    :::image type="content" alt-text="Screenshot of the Microsoft Intune admin center - Dashboard." source="./media/tutorial-walkthrough-endpoint-manager/tutorial-walkthrough-mem-02.png" lightbox="./media/tutorial-walkthrough-endpoint-manager/tutorial-walkthrough-mem-02.png":::
    
    Intune lets you manage your workforce's devices and apps, including how they access your company data. To use this mobile device management (MDM) service, the devices must first be enrolled in Intune. When a device is enrolled, it is issued an MDM certificate. This certificate is used to communicate with the Intune service. 

    There are several methods to enroll your workforce's devices into Intune. Each method depends on the device's ownership (personal or corporate), device type (iOS/iPadOS, Windows, Android), and management requirements (resets, affinity, locking). However, before you can enable device enrollment, you must set up your Intune infrastructure. In particular, device enrollment requires that you [set your MDM authority](mdm-authority-set.md). For more information about getting your Intune environment (tenant) ready, see [Set up Intune](deployment-plan-setup.md). Once you have your Intune tenant ready, you can enroll devices. For more information about device enrollment, see [What is device enrollment?](/mem/intune/fundamentals/deployment-guide-enrollment)

3. From the navigation pane, select **Devices** to display details about the enrolled devices in your Intune tenant. 

    > [!TIP]
    > If you have previously used Intune in the Azure portal, you found the above details in the Azure portal by signing in to [Intune](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2090973) and selecting **Devices**.

    The **Devices - Overview** pane provides device details, such as the following information:
    - **Manage devices by platform** - You can quickly see the number of devices that are managed for each platform. Selecting a platform allows you to see additional details.
    - **Configuration policy assignment failures** - You can check wither you have any profiles with errors or conflicts. 
    - **Noncompliant devices** - You can see a count of noncompliant devices for your tenant.
    - **Deployment status per Windows update ring** - You can see if there are any Windows device with update errors or conflicts.

    > [!TIP]
    > If you have previously used Intune in the Azure portal, you found the above details in the Azure portal by signing in to [Intune](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2090973) and selecting **Device Compliance**.

    Compliance requirements are essentially rules, such as requiring a device PIN, or requiring device encryption. Device compliance policies define the rules and settings that a device must follow to be considered compliant. To use device compliance, you must have:
    - An Intune and a Microsoft Entra ID P1 or P2 subscription
    - Devices running a supported platform
    - Devices must be enrolled in Intune
    - Devices that are enrolled to either one user or no primary user.
    
    For more information, see [Get started with device compliance policies in Intune](../protect/device-compliance-get-started.md).

5. From the **Devices - Overview** pane, select **Conditional Access** to display details about access policies.

    As an IT admin, you can use Microsoft Intune to manage the client apps that your company's workforce uses. This functionality is in addition to managing devices and protecting data. One of an admin's priorities is to ensure that end users have access to the apps they need to do their work. Additionally, you might want to assign and manage apps on devices that are not enrolled with Intune. Intune offers a range of capabilities to help you get the apps you need on the devices you want. 

    > [!NOTE]
    > The **Apps - Overview** pane also provides tenant status and account details.
