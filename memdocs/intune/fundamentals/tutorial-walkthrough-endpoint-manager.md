## Tour Microsoft Intune in the Microsoft Intune admin center

Follow the steps below to better understand Intune in the Microsoft Intune admin center. Once you complete the tour, you'll have a better understanding of some of the major areas of Intune.

1. Open a browser and sign in to the [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431). If you are new to Intune, use your free trial subscription.

    ![Screenshot of the Microsoft Intune admin center - Home page](./media/tutorial-walkthrough-endpoint-manager/tutorial-walkthrough-mem-01.png)

    When you open the Microsoft Intune admin center, the service is displayed in a pane of your browser. Some of the first workloads you may use in Intune include **Devices**, **Apps**, **Users**, and **Groups**. A workload is simply a sub-area of a service. When you select the workload, it opens that pane as a full page. Other panes slide out from the right side of the pane when they open, and close to reveal the previous pane. 

    By default, when you open the Microsoft Intune admin center, you'll see the **Home page** pane. This pane provides an overall visual snapshot of tenant status and compliance status, as well as other helpful related links.

2. From the navigation pane, select **Dashboard** to display overall details about the devices and client apps in your Intune tenant. If you are starting with a new Intune tenant, you will not have any enrolled devices yet. 

    ![Screenshot of the Microsoft Intune admin center - Dashboard](./media/tutorial-walkthrough-endpoint-manager/tutorial-walkthrough-mem-02.png)
    
    Intune lets you manage your workforce's devices and apps, including how they access your company data. To use this mobile device management (MDM) service, the devices must first be enrolled in Intune. When a device is enrolled, it is issued an MDM certificate. This certificate is used to communicate with the Intune service. 

    There are several methods to enroll your workforce's devices into Intune. Each method depends on the device's ownership (personal or corporate), device type (iOS/iPadOS, Windows, Android), and management requirements (resets, affinity, locking). However, before you can enable device enrollment, you must set up your Intune infrastructure. In particular, device enrollment requires that you [set your MDM authority](mdm-authority-set.md). For more information about getting your Intune environment (tenant) ready, see [Set up Intune](deployment-plan-setup.md). Once you have your Intune tenant ready, you can enroll devices. For more information about device enrollment, see [What is device enrollment?](/mem/intune/fundamentals/deployment-guide-enrollment)

3. From the navigation pane, select **Devices** to display details about the enrolled devices in your Intune tenant. 

    > [!TIP]
    > If you have previously used Intune in the Azure portal, you found the above details in the Azure portal by signing in to [Intune](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2090973) and selecting **Devices**.

    The **Devices - Overview** pane has several tabs that allow you to view a summary of the following statuses and alerts:
    - **Enrollment status** - Review details about Intune enrolled devices by platform and enrollment failures.
    - **Enrollment alerts** - Find more details about unassigned devices by platform. 
    - **Compliance status** - Review compliance status based on device, policy, setting, threats, and protection. Additionally, this pane provides a list of devices without a compliance policy.
    - **Configuration status** - Review configuration status of device profiles, as well as profile deployment., and 
    - **Software update status** - See a visual of the deployment status for all devices and for all users.

    Compliance requirements are essentially rules, such as requiring a device PIN, or requiring device encryption. Device compliance policies define the rules and settings that a device must follow to be considered compliant. To use device compliance, you must have:
    - An Intune and a Microsoft Entra ID P1 or P2 subscription
    - Devices running a supported platform
    - Devices must be enrolled in Intune
    - Devices that are enrolled to either one user or no primary user.
