# Using the Intune docs

This article provides information to help you search the Microsoft Intune docs for information, provide feedback for the Intune docs, and shows how you can quickly and easily contribute to the docs.

For general help and support for Intune, see [Get support for Intune](get-support.md).

## Search the docs

 Use the following search tips to help you find the information that you need:  

- When using your preferred search engine to locate content for Microsoft Intune, include `Intune` along with your search keywords.  

  - Look for results from docs.microsoft.com. Results from technet.microsoft.com or msdn.microsoft.com are for older product versions.  

  - To further focus the search results to the current content library, include `site:docs.microsoft.com` to scope the search engine.  

- Use search terms that match terminology in the user interface and online documentation. Avoid unofficial terms or abbreviations that you might see in community content.

- To search within an article you are currently viewing, use your browser's **Find** feature. With most modern web browsers, press **Ctrl**+**F** and then enter your search terms.  

- Each article on docs.microsoft.com includes the following fields to assist with searching the content:  

  - **Search** in the upper right corner. To search all articles enter terms in this field. The search automatically includes the Intune search scope.

  - **Filter by title** above the left table of contents. To search the current table of contents, enter terms in this field. This field only matches terms that appear in the article titles for the current node. The last item in the search results gives you the option to search for the terms in all Intune documentation.

- Having problems finding something? [File feedback!](#provide-doc-feedback) When filing the issue, provide the search engine you're using, the keywords you tried, and the target article. This feedback helps Microsoft optimize the content for better search.  

## Provide doc feedback

The Feedback section is at the bottom of each article. Click the **Feedback** link in the upper right of any article to go to this section. Feedback is integrated with GitHub Issues. For more information about the integration with GitHub Issues, see this [docs platform blog post](https://docs.microsoft.com/teamblog/a-new-feedback-system-is-coming-to-docs).

To share feedback about the Intune service (not docs), click **Product feedback**.

A [GitHub account](https://github.com/join) is a prerequisite for providing documentation feedback. Once you sign in, there is a one-time authorization for MicrosoftDocs. Then when you click **Content feedback**, enter a title and comment, and then **Submit feedback**. This action files a new issue for the target article in the [Intune GitHub repository](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/intunedocs/issues).

You will also see existing open or closed issues for the target article. If any exist, review them before submitting a new issue. If you find a related issue, click the face icon to add a reaction, or you can expand it to add a comment.

### Types of feedback

Use GitHub Issues to submit the following types of feedback:

- Doc bug: The content is out of date, unclear, confusing, or broken.
- Doc enhancement: A suggestion to improve the article.
- Doc question: You need help finding existing documentation.
- Doc idea: A suggestion for a new article. Use this method instead of UserVoice for documentation feedback.
- Kudos: Positive feedback about a helpful or informative article!
- Localization: Feedback about content translation.
- Search engine optimization (SEO): Feedback about problems searching for content. Include the search engine, keywords, and target article in the comments.

If issues are raised for non-doc-related topics, such as [product feedback](https://microsoftintune.uservoice.com/forums/291681-ideas), [product questions](https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/home?forum=microsoftintuneprod), or [support requests](get-support.md), these issues will be closed and the user redirected to the proper feedback channel.

To share feedback on the docs.microsoft.com platform, see [Docs feedback](https://aka.ms/sitefeedback). The platform includes all of the wrapper components such as the header, table of contents, and right menu. Also how the articles render in the browser, such as the font, alert boxes, and page anchors.

## Contribute to docs

The Intune docs, like most content on docs.microsoft.com, is open-sourced on GitHub. This library accepts and encourages community contributions. For more information on how to get started, see the [Contributor Guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/contribute). Creating a [GitHub account](https://github.com/join) is the only prerequisite.

### Basic steps to contribute to docs

1. From the target article, click **Edit**. This action opens the source file in GitHub.  

2. To edit the source file, click the pencil icon.  

3. Make changes in the markdown source. For more information, see [How to use Markdown for writing Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/contribute/contribute-how-to-write-use-markdown).  

4. In the Propose file change section, enter the public commit comment describing *what* you changed. Then click **Propose file change**.  

5. Scroll down and verify the changes you made. Click **Create pull request** to open the form. Describe *why* you made this change. Click **Create pull request**.

The writing team will receive your pull request, assign the item to the appropriate writer, review the text and do a quick edit pass on it, and either approve and merge the changes or contact you for more information about the update.  

### What to contribute

If you're interested in contributing, but don't know where to start, see the following suggestions:  

- Review an article for accuracy. Then update the **ms.date** metadata using `mm/dd/yyyy` format. This contribution helps keep the content fresh.  

- Add clarifications, examples, or guidance based on your experience. This contribution uses the power of the community to share knowledge.

- Correct translations in a non-English language. This contribution improves the usability of localized content.  

> [!Note]  
> Larger contributions require signing a Contribution License Agreement (CLA) if you aren't a Microsoft employee. GitHub automatically requires you to sign this agreement when a contribution meets the threshold. You only need to sign this agreement once.

### Tips

Follow these general guidelines when contributing to Intune docs:

- Don't surprise us with large pull requests. Instead, [file an issue](#provide-doc-feedback) and start a discussion. Then we can agree on a direction before you invest a large amount of time.  

- Read the [Microsoft style guide](https://aka.ms/MicrosoftStyle). Know the [Top 10 tips for Microsoft style and voice](https://docs.microsoft.com/style-guide/top-10-tips-style-voice).  

- Follow the [GitHub Flow workflow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/).  

- Blog and tweet (or whatever) about your contributions, frequently!  

## Consolidation of documentation for Microsoft Endpoint Manager

To better support combined scenarios for Intune and Configuration Manager, the Intune and Configuration Manager documentation have been consolidated on the Microsoft Endpoint Manager site. The Intune documentation is now at [https://docs.microsoft.com/mem/intune](https://docs.microsoft.com/mem/intune) and the Configuration Manager documentation library is available at [https://docs.microsoft.com/mem/configmgr](https://docs.microsoft.com/mem/configmgr). All links will automatically redirect if you are using an old URL, so you don't need to make any changes for reading this content.

If you provide feedback or contribute to articles, some changes are necessary:

- Existing GitHub issues remained in the original repository, [https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/IntuneDocs/issues](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/IntuneDocs/issues) or [https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/sccmdocs/issues](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/sccmdocs/).

  - These issues won't show as open or closed issues in the Feedback section of the linked article.

  - We will continue to work towards resolving these issues going forward.

  - In some instances, we may make the tough decision to close an issue that we don't think we'll be able to address in a timely manner.

  - If you have an issue in the existing repository, and are passionate about it, file feedback on the migrated article in the memdocs repository.

- We will merge and close any open pull requests before the migration.

- After migration, when you file feedback or edit an article, the issue or pull request will go to the memdocs repository.
