# Microsoft Intune planning guide

A successful Microsoft Intune deployment or migration starts with planning. This guide helps you plan your move or adoption of Intune as your unified endpoint management solution.

:::image type="content" source="./media/intune-planning-guide/intune-planning-guide-steps-image.png" alt-text="Diagram that shows the steps to plan your migration or move to Microsoft Intune, including licensing needs." lightbox="./media/intune-planning-guide/intune-planning-guide-steps-image.png":::

Intune gives organizations options to do what's best for them and the many different user devices. You can enroll devices in Intune for mobile device management (MDM). You can also use app protection policies for mobile application management (MAM) that focus on protecting app data.

This guide:

- Lists and describes some common objectives for device management
- Lists potential licensing needs
- Provides guidance on handling personally owned devices
- Recommends reviewing current policies and infrastructure
- Gives examples of creating a rollout plan
- And more

Use this guide to plan your move or migration to Intune.

## Step 1 - Determine your objectives

Organizations use mobile device management (MDM) and mobile application management (MAM) to control organization data securely, and with minimal disruption to users. When evaluating an MDM/MAM solution, like Microsoft Intune, look at what the goal is, and what you want to achieve.

In this section, we discuss common objectives or scenarios when using Intune.

### Objective: Access organizational apps and email

Users expect to work on devices using organization apps, including reading and responding to email, updating and sharing data, and more. In Intune, you can deploy different types of apps, including:

- Microsoft 365 apps
- Win32 apps
- Line-of-business (LOB) apps
- Custom apps
- Built-in apps
- Store apps

✅ **Task: Make a list of the apps your users regularly use**

These apps are the apps you want on their devices. Some considerations:

- Many organizations deploy all Microsoft 365 apps, like Word, Excel, OneNote, PowerPoint, and Teams. On smaller devices, like mobile phones, you can install individual apps, depending on the user requirements.

  For example, the sales team might require Teams, Excel, and SharePoint. On mobile devices, you can deploy only these apps, instead of deploying the entire Microsoft 365 product family.

- Users prefer to read & reply to email and join meetings on all devices, including personal devices. On organization-owned devices, you can deploy Outlook and Teams, and preconfigure these apps with your organization settings.

  On personal devices, you might not have this control. So, determine if you want to give users access to organization apps, like email and meetings.

  For more information and considerations, go to [Personal devices vs. Organization-owned devices](#personal-devices-vs-organization-owned-devices) (in this article).

- If you plan to use Microsoft Outlook on your Android and iOS/iPadOS devices, you can preconfigure Outlook using Intune [app configuration policies](../apps/app-configuration-policies-overview.md).
- Review the [protected apps designed to work with Intune](../apps/apps-supported-intune-apps.md). These apps are supported partner apps and Microsoft apps that are commonly used with Microsoft Intune.

### Objective: Secure access on all devices

When data is stored on mobile devices, it must be protected from malicious activity.

✅ **Task: Determine how you want to secure your devices**

Antivirus, malware scanning, responding to threats, and keep devices up-to-date are all important considerations. You also want to minimize the impact of malicious activity.

Some considerations:

- **Antivirus (AV) and malware protection are a must**. Intune integrates with [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint](../protect/advanced-threat-protection.md) and [different Mobile Threat Defense (MTD) partners](../protect/mobile-threat-defense.md) to help protect your managed devices, personal devices, and apps.

  [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint](/windows/security/threat-protection/microsoft-defender-atp/microsoft-defender-advanced-threat-protection) includes security features and a [portal](/microsoft-365/security/defender/microsoft-365-security-center-mde) to help monitor, and react to threats.

- If a device is compromised, you want to **limit malicious impact using [Conditional Access](../protect/conditional-access.md)**.

  For example, Microsoft Defender for Endpoint scans a device, and can determine if the device is compromised. Conditional Access can automatically block organization access on this device, including email.

  Conditional Access helps protect your network and resources from devices, even devices that aren't enrolled in Intune.

- **Update the device, the OS, and apps to help keep your data secure**. Create a plan on how and when updates are installed. There are policies in Intune that help you manage updates, including updates to store apps.

  The following software updates planning guides can help you determine your update strategy:

  - [Personal/BYOD](../protect/software-updates-guide-personal-byod.md)
  - [Android](../protect/software-updates-guide-android.md)
  - [iOS/iPadOS](../protect/software-updates-guide-ios-ipados.md)
  - [macOS](../protect/software-updates-guide-macos.md)

- **Determine how users will authenticate to organization resources** from their many devices. For example, you can:

  - Use [certificates](../protect/certificates-configure.md) on devices to authenticate features and apps, like connecting to a virtual private network (VPN), opening Outlook, and more. These certificates allow for a "password-less" user experience. Password-less is considered more secure than requiring users to enter their organization username and password.

    If you're planning to use certificates, use a supported [public key infrastructure (PKI) infrastructure](../protect/certificates-configure.md) to create and deploy certificate profiles.

  - Use [multifactor authentication (MFA)](/entra/identity/authentication/concept-mfa-howitworks) for an extra layer of authentication on organization-owned devices. Or, use MFA to authenticate apps on personal devices. Biometrics, like face recognition and fingerprints, can also be used.

    If you plan to use biometrics for authentication, be sure your devices support biometrics. Most modern devices do.

  - Implement a [Zero Trust deployment](zero-trust-with-microsoft-intune.md). With Zero Trust, you use the features in Microsoft Entra ID and Microsoft Intune to secure all endpoints, uses password-less authentication, and more.

- **Configure the data containment policies** that come with the Microsoft 365 apps. These policies help prevent organization data from being shared with other apps and storage locations that your IT doesn't manage.

  If some users only need access to corporate email and documents, which is common for personally owned devices, then you can require users to use Microsoft 365 apps with app protection policies. The devices don't have to be enrolled in Intune.

  For more information and considerations, go to [Personal devices vs. Organization-owned devices](#personal-devices-vs-organization-owned-devices) (in this article).

### Objective: Distribute IT

Many organizations want to give different admins control over locations, departments, and so on. For example, the **Charlotte IT Admins** group controls and monitors the policies in the Charlotte campus. These Charlotte IT Admins can only see and manage policies for the Charlotte location. They can't see and manage policies for the Redmond location. This approach is called distributed IT.

In Intune, distributed IT benefits from the following features:

- **[Scope tags](scope-tags.md)** use role-based access control (RBAC). So, only users in a specific group have permission to manage policies and profiles for users and devices in their scope.

- When you use **[device enrollment categories](../enrollment/device-group-mapping.md)**, devices are automatically added to groups based on categories you create. This feature used Microsoft Entra dynamic groups, and helps make managing devices easier.

  When users enroll their device, they choose a category, like Sales, IT admin, point-of-sale device, and so on. When the devices are added to a category, these device groups are ready to receive your policies.

- When admins create policies, you can require **[multiple admin approval](multi-admin-approval.md)** for specific policies, including policies that run scripts or deploy apps.

- **[Endpoint Privilege Management](../protect/epm-overview.md)** allows standard non-admin user complete tasks that require elevated privileges, like  installing apps and updating device drivers. Endpoint Privilege Management is part of the [Intune Suite](intune-add-ons.md).

✅ **Task: Determine how you want to distribute your rules and settings**

Rules and settings are deployed using different policies. Some considerations:

- Determine your admin structure. For example, you might want to separate by location, like **Charlotte IT Admins** or **Cambridge IT Admins**. You might want to separate by role, like **Network Admins** that control all network access, including VPN.

  These categories become your [scope tags](scope-tags.md).

  For more information on creating admin groups, go to:

  - [Distributed IT environment with many admins in the same Microsoft Intune tenant](intune-scale-guidelines.md)
  - [Role-based access control (RBAC) with Microsoft Intune](role-based-access-control.md)

- Sometimes organizations need to use Distributed IT in systems where a large number of local admins connect to a single Intune tenant. For example, a large organization has a single Intune tenant. The organization has a large number of local admins, and each admin manages a specific system, region, or location. Each admin needs to manage only their location, and not the entire organization.

  For more information, go to [Distributed IT environment with many admins in the same Intune tenant](intune-scale-guidelines.md).

- Many organizations separate groups by the device type, like iOS/iPadOS, Android, or Windows devices. Some examples:

  - Distribute specific apps to specific devices. For example, deploy the Microsoft shuttle app to mobile devices in the Redmond network.
  - Deploy policies to specific locations. For example, deploy a Wi-Fi profile to devices in the Charlotte network so they automatically connect when in range.
  - Control settings on specific devices. For example, disable the camera on Android Enterprise devices used on a manufacturing floor, create a Windows Defender antivirus profile for all Windows devices, or add e-mail settings to all iOS/iPadOS devices.

  These categories become your [device enrollment categories](../enrollment/device-group-mapping.md).

### Objective: Keep organization data inside the organization

When data is stored on mobile devices, the data should be protected from accidental loss or sharing. This objective also includes wiping organization data from personal and organization-owned devices.

✅ **Task: Create a plan to cover different scenarios that impact your organization**

Some sample scenarios:

- A device is lost or stolen, or no longer being used. A user leaves the organization.
  - In Intune, you can [remove devices by using wipe, retire, or manually unenroll them](../remote-actions/devices-wipe.md). You can also automatically remove devices that haven't checked in with Intune for *x* number of days.
  - At the app level, you can [remove organization data from Intune-managed apps](../apps/apps-selective-wipe.md). A selective wipe is great for personal devices, as it keeps personal data on the device, and only removes organization data.

- On personal devices, you might want to prevent users from copy/paste, taking screenshots, or forwarding emails. [App protection policies](../apps/app-protection-policy.md) can block these features on devices you don't manage.

  On managed devices (devices enrolled in Intune), you can also control these features using device configuration profiles. [Device configuration profiles](../configuration/device-profiles.md) control settings on the device, not the app. On devices that access highly sensitive or confidential data, device configuration profiles can prevent copy/paste, taking screenshots, and more.

For more information and considerations, go to [Personal devices vs. Organization-owned devices](#personal-devices-vs-organization-owned-devices) (in this article).

## Step 2 - Inventory your devices

Organizations have a range of devices, including desktop computers, laptops, tablets, hand-held scanners, and mobile phones. These devices are owned by the organization, or owned by your users. When planning your device management strategy, consider everything that accesses your organization resources, including personal devices.

This section includes device information you should consider.

### Supported platforms

Intune supports the common and popular device platforms. For the specific versions, go to [supported platforms](supported-devices-browsers.md).

✅ **Task: Upgrade or replace older devices**

If your devices use unsupported versions, which are primarily older operating systems, then it's time to upgrade the OS or replace the devices. These older OS' and devices might have limited support, and are a potential security risk. This task includes desktop computers running Windows 7, iPhone 7 devices running the original v10.0 OS, and so on.

### Personal devices vs Organization-owned devices

On personal devices, it's normal and expected for users to check email, join meetings, update files, and more. Many organizations allow personal devices to access organization resources.

BYOD/personal devices are part of a mobile application management (MAM) strategy that:

- Continues to grow in popularity with many organizations
- Is a good option for organizations that want to protect organization data, but don't want to manage the entire device
- Reduces hardware costs.
- Can increase mobile productivity choices for employees, including remote & hybrid workers
- Only removes organization data from apps, instead of removing all data from the device

Organization-owned devices are part of a mobile device management (MDM) strategy that:

- Gives full control to IT admins in your organization
- Has a rich set of features that manages apps, devices, and users
- Is a good option for organizations that want to manage the entire device, including hardware and software
- Can increase hardware costs, especially if existing devices are outdated or not supported anymore
- Can remove all data from the device, including personal data

:::image type="content" source="./media/intune-planning-guide/byod-app-device-mgmt.png" alt-text="Screenshot that Compares mobile device management and app management on devices in Microsoft Intune." lightbox="./media/intune-planning-guide/byod-app-device-mgmt.png":::

As an organization and as an admin, you decide if personal devices are allowed. If you do allow personal devices, then you need to make important decisions, including how to protect your organization data.

✅ **Task: Determine how you want to handle personal devices**

If being mobile or supporting remote workers is important to your organization, consider the following approaches:

- **Option 1**: Allow personal devices to access organization resources. Users have a **choice to enroll or not enroll**.

  - For users that **enroll their personal devices**, admins fully manage these devices, including pushing policies, controlling device features & settings, and even wiping devices. As an admin, you might want this control, or you might *think* you want this control.

    When users enroll their personal devices, they might not realize or understand that admins can do anything on the device, including accidentally wiping or resetting the device. As an admin, you might not want this liability or potential impact on devices your organization doesn't own.

    Also, many users refuse to enroll, and can find other ways to access organization resources. For example, you require devices be enrolled to use the Outlook app to check organization email. To skip this requirement, users open any web browser on the device, and sign in to Outlook web access, which might not be what you want. Or, they create screenshots, and save the images on the device, which also isn't what you want.

    If you choose this option, be sure to educate users on the risks and benefits of enrolling their personal devices.

  - For users that **don't enroll their personal devices**, then you manage app access and secure app data using app protection policies.

    Use a [Terms and conditions](../enrollment/terms-and-conditions-create.md) statement with a Conditional Access policy. If users don't agree, then they don't get access to apps. If users agree to the statement, then a device record is added to Microsoft Entra ID, and the device becomes a known entity. When the device is known, you can track what's being accessed from the device.

    Always control access and security using app policies.

    Look at the tasks your organization uses the most, like email and joining meetings. Use [app configuration policies](../apps/app-configuration-policies-overview.md) to configure app-specific settings, like Outlook. Use [app protection policies](../apps/app-protection-policy.md) to control the security and access to these apps.

    For example, users can use the Outlook app on their personal device to check work email. In Intune, admins create an Outlook app protection policy. This policy uses multifactor authentication (MFA) every time the Outlook app opens, prevents copy and paste, and restricts other features.

- **Option 2**: You want **every device to be fully managed**. In this scenario, all devices are enrolled in Intune and managed by the organization, including personal devices.

  To help enforce enrollment, you can deploy a Conditional Access (CA) policy that requires devices to enroll in Intune. On these devices, you can also:

  - Configure a **WiFi/VPN connection for organization connectivity** and deploy these connection policies to devices. Users don't need to enter any settings.
  - If **users need specific apps** on their device, then deploy the apps. You can also deploy apps that your organization requires for security purposes, like a mobile threat defense app.
  - Use **compliance policies to set any rules** your organization must follow, like regulatory or policies that call out specific MDM controls. For example, you need Intune to encrypt the entire device or to produce a report of all apps on the device.

  If you want to also control the hardware, then give users all the devices they need, including mobile phones. Invest in a hardware refresh plan so users continue to be productive, and get the newest built-in security features. Enroll these organization-owned devices in Intune, and manage them using policies.

As a best practice, always assume data will leave the device. Be sure your tracking and auditing methods are in place. For more information, see [Zero Trust with Microsoft Intune](zero-trust-with-microsoft-intune.md).

### Manage desktop computers

Intune can manage desktop computers running Windows 10 and newer. The Windows client OS includes built-in modern device management features, and removes dependencies on local Active Directory (AD) group policy. You get the benefits of the cloud when creating rules and settings in Intune, and deploying these policies to all your Windows client devices, including desktop computers and PCs.

For more information, go to [Guided scenario - Cloud-managed Modern Desktop](guided-scenarios-cloud-managed-pc.md).

If your Windows devices are currently managed using Configuration Manager, you can still enroll these devices in Intune. This approach is called **co-management**. Co-management offers many benefits, including running remote actions on the device (restart, remote control, factory reset), Conditional Access with device compliance, and more. You can also cloud-attach your devices to Intune.

For more information, go to:

- [What is co-management](../../configmgr/comanage/overview.md)
- [Paths to co-management](../../configmgr/comanage/quickstart-paths.md)
- [Configuration Manager tenant attach](../../configmgr/tenant-attach/device-sync-actions.md)

✅ **Task: Look at what you currently use for mobile device management**

Your adoption of a mobile device management can depend on what your organization currently uses, including if that solution uses on-premises features or programs.

The [setup deployment guide](deployment-guide-intune-setup.md) has some good information.

Some considerations:

- If you currently don't use any MDM service or solution, then going straight to Intune might be best.
- If you currently use on-premises Group Policy Objects (GPO), then going to Intune and using the [Intune settings catalog](../configuration/settings-catalog.md) is similar, and can be an easier transition to cloud-based device policy. The settings catalog also includes settings for Apple devices and Google Chrome.
- For new devices not enrolled in Configuration Manager, or any MDM solution, then going straight to Intune might be best.
- If you currently use Configuration Manager, then your options include:

  - If you want to keep your existing infrastructure, and move some workloads to the cloud, then use co-management. You get the benefit of both services. Existing devices can receive some policies from Configuration Manager (on-premises), and other policies from Intune (cloud).
  - If you want to keep your existing infrastructure, and use Intune to help monitor your on-premises devices, then use tenant-attach. You get the benefit of using the Intune admin center, while still using Configuration Manager to manage devices.
  - If you want a pure cloud solution to manage devices, then move to Intune. Some Configuration Manager users prefer to continue using Configuration Manager with tenant attach or co-management.

  For more information, go to [co-management workloads](../../configmgr/comanage/workloads.md).

### Frontline worker (FLW) devices

Shared tablets and devices are common for frontline workers (FLW). They're used in many industries, including retail, healthcare, manufacturing, and more.

There are options available for the different platforms, including Android (AOSP) virtual reality devices, iPad devices, and Windows 365 Cloud PCs.

✅ **Task: Determine your FLW scenarios**

FLW devices are organization-owned, enrolled into device management, and are used by one user (user assigned) or many users (shared devices). These devices are critical to frontline workers to do their job, and are often used in a limited-use mode. For example, it can be a device that scans items, a kiosk that displays information, or a tablet that checks in patients at a hospital or medical facility.

For more information, go to [Frontline worker device management in Microsoft Intune](frontline-worker-overview.md).

## Step 3 - Determine costs and licensing

Managing devices is a relationship with different services. Intune includes the settings and features you can control on different devices. There are also other services that play a key role:

- **Microsoft Entra ID P1 or P2** (included in the **Microsoft 365 E5** license) includes several features that are key to managing devices, including:

  - **[Windows Autopilot](/autopilot/enrollment-autopilot)**: Windows client devices can automatically enroll in Intune, and automatically receive your policies.
  - **[Multi-factor authentication](../enrollment/multi-factor-authentication.md) (MFA)**: Users must enter two or more verification methods, like a PIN, an authenticator app, a fingerprint, and more. MFA is a great option when using app protection policies for personal devices, and organization-owned devices that require extra security.
  - **[Conditional Access](../protect/conditional-access.md)**: If users and devices follow your rules, like a 6-digit passcode, then they get access to organization resources. If users or devices don't meet your rules, then they don't get access.
  - **[Dynamic user groups and dynamic device groups](groups-add.md)**: Add users or devices automatically to groups when they meet criteria, like a city, job title, OS type, OS version, and more.

- **Microsoft 365 apps** (included in the **Microsoft 365 E5** license) includes the apps that users rely on, including Outlook, Word, SharePoint, Teams, OneDrive, and more. You can deploy these apps to devices using Intune.

- **Microsoft Defender for Endpoint** (included in the **Microsoft 365 E5** license) helps monitor and scan your Windows client devices for malicious activity. You can also set an acceptable threat level. When combined with Conditional Access, you can block access to organization resources if the threat level is exceeded.

- **Microsoft Purview** (included in the **Microsoft 365 E5** license) classifies and protects documents and emails by applying labels. On Microsoft 365 apps, you can use this service to [prevent unauthorized access to organization data](/microsoft-365/compliance/information-protection), including apps on personal devices.

- **[Microsoft Copilot in Intune](../copilot/copilot-intune-overview.md)** is a generative-AI security analysis tool. It accesses your Intune data and can help you manage your policies and settings, understand your security posture, and troubleshoot device issues.  

  Copilot in Intune is licensed through Microsoft Security Copilot. For more information, go to [Get started with Microsoft Security Copilot](/copilot/security/get-started-security-copilot).

- **[Intune Suite](intune-add-ons.md)** provides advanced endpoint management and security features, like remote help, Microsoft Cloud PKI, Endpoint Privilege Management, and more. The Intune Suite is available as a separate license.

For more information, go to:

- [Microsoft Intune licensing](licenses.md)
- [Microsoft 365 for business](https://www.microsoft.com/licensing/product-licensing/microsoft-365-business)
- [Microsoft 365 enterprise licensing](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/compare-microsoft-365-enterprise-plans)
- [Microsoft Intune Suite](intune-add-ons.md)

✅ **Task: Determine the licensed services your organization needs**

Some considerations:

- If your goal is to deploy policies (rules) and profiles (settings), without any enforcement, at a minimum, you need:

  - Intune

  Intune is available with different subscriptions, including as a stand-alone service. For more information, go to [Microsoft Intune licensing](licenses.md).

  You currently use Configuration Manager, and want to set up co-management for your devices. Intune is already included in your Configuration Manager license. If you want Intune to fully manage new devices or existing co-managed devices, then you need a separate Intune license.

- You want to enforce the compliance or password rules you create in Intune. At a minimum, you need:

  - Intune
  - Microsoft Entra ID P1 or P2

  Intune and Microsoft Entra ID P1 or P2 are available with **Enterprise Mobility + Security**. For more information, go to [Enterprise Mobility + Security pricing options](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/enterprise-mobility-security/compare-plans-and-pricing).

- You want to only manage Microsoft 365 apps on devices. At a minimum, you need:

  - Microsoft 365 Basic Mobility and Security

  For more information, go to:

  - [Choose between Basic Mobility and Security or Intune](/microsoft-365/admin/basic-mobility-security/choose-between-basic-mobility-and-security-and-intune)
  - [Basic Mobility and Security frequently-asked questions (FAQ)](/microsoft-365/admin/basic-mobility-security/frequently-asked-questions)

- You want to deploy Microsoft 365 apps to your devices, and create policies to help secure devices that run these apps. At a minimum, you need:

  - Intune
  - Microsoft 365 apps

- You want to create policies in Intune, deploy Microsoft 365 apps, and enforce your rules and settings. At a minimum, you need:

  - Intune
  - Microsoft 365 apps
  - Microsoft Entra ID P1 or P2

  Since all these services are included in some Microsoft 365 plans, then it might be cost effective to use the Microsoft 365 license.
  For more information, go to [Microsoft 365 licensing plans](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/compare-all-microsoft-365-plans).

## Step 4 - Review existing policies and infrastructure

Many organizations have existing policies and device management infrastructure that's only being "maintained". For example, you might have 20-year-old group policies, and don't know what they do. When considering a move to the cloud, instead of looking at what you've always done, determine the goal.

With these goals in mind, create a baseline of your policies. If you have multiple device management solutions, now might be the time to use a single mobile device management service.

✅ **Task: Look at tasks you run on-premises**

This task includes looking at services that could move to the cloud. Remember, instead of looking at what you've always done, determine the goal.

> [!TIP]
> [Learn more about cloud-native endpoints](../../solutions/cloud-native-endpoints/cloud-native-endpoints-overview.md) is good resource.

Some considerations:

- **Review existing policies and their structure**. Some policies can apply globally, some apply at the site level, and some are specific to a device. The goal is to know and understand the intent of global policies, the intent of local policies, and so on.

  On-premises Active Directory group policies are applied in the LSDOU order - local, site, domain, and organizational unit (OU). In this hierarchy, OU policies overwrite domain policies, domain policies overwrite site policies, and so on.

  In Intune, policies are applied to users and groups you create. There isn't a hierarchy. If two policies update the same setting, then the setting shows as a conflict. For more information on conflict behavior, go to [Common questions, issues, and resolutions with device policies and profiles](../configuration/device-profile-troubleshoot.md#compliance-and-device-configuration-policies-that-conflict).

  After you review your policies, your AD global policies logically start to apply to groups you have, or groups you need. These groups include users and devices you want to target at the global level, site level, and so on. This task gives you an idea of the group structure you need in Intune. [Performance recommendations for grouping, targeting, and filtering in large Microsoft Intune environments](filters-performance-recommendations.md) might be a good resource.

- **Be prepared to create new policies** in Intune. Intune includes several features that cover scenarios that might interest you. Some examples:

  - **Security baselines**: On Windows client devices, [security baselines](../protect/security-baselines.md) are security settings that are preconfigured to recommended values. If you're new to securing devices, or want a comprehensive baseline, then look at security baselines.

    [Settings insight](settings-insight.md) provides confidence in configurations by adding insights that similar organizations successfully adopted. Insights are available for some settings and not all settings. For more information, see [Settings insight](settings-insight.md).

  - **Settings catalog**: On Apple and Windows client devices, the [settings catalog](../configuration/settings-catalog.md) lists all the settings you can configure and looks similar to on-premises GPOs. When you create the policy, you start from scratch and configure settings at a granular level.
  - **Administrative templates (ADMX)**: On Windows client devices, use [ADMX templates](../configuration/administrative-templates-windows.md) to configure group policy settings for Windows, Internet Explorer, Office, and Microsoft Edge version 77 and later. These ADMX templates are the same ADMX templates used in on-premises AD group policy, but are 100% cloud-based in Intune.
  - **Group policy**: Use [group policy analytics](../configuration/group-policy-analytics.md) to import and analyze your GPOs. This feature helps you determine how your GPOs translate in the cloud. The output shows which settings are supported in MDM providers, including Microsoft Intune. It also shows any deprecated settings, or settings not available to MDM providers.

    You can also create an Intune policy based on your imported settings. For more information, go to [Create a settings catalog policy using your imported GPOs](../configuration/group-policy-analytics-migrate.md).

  - **Guided scenarios**: [Guided scenarios](guided-scenarios-overview.md) are a customized series of steps focused on end-to-end use cases. These scenarios automatically include policies, apps, assignments, and other management configurations.

- **Create a policy baseline** that includes the minimum of your goals. For example:

  - Secure e-mail: At a minimum, you might want to:
    - Create Outlook app protection policies.
    - Enable [Conditional Access](../protect/conditional-access.md) for Exchange Online, or connecting to another on-premises email solution.

  - Device settings: At a minimum, you might want to:
    - Require a six character PIN to unlock the device.
    - Prevent backups to personal cloud services, like iCloud or OneDrive.

  - Device profiles: At a minimum, you might want to:
    - Create a [Wi-Fi profile](../configuration/wi-fi-settings-configure.md) with the preconfigured settings that connect to the Contoso Wi-Fi wireless network.
    - Create a [VPN profile](../configuration/vpn-settings-configure.md) with a certificate to automatically authenticate, and connect to an organization VPN.
    - Create an [email profile](..//configuration/email-settings-configure.md) with the preconfigured settings that connect to Outlook.

  - Apps: At a minimum, you might want to:
    - Deploy Microsoft 365 apps with app protection policies.
    - Deploy line of business (LOB) with app protection policies.

  For more information on minimum recommended settings, go to:

  - [Step 3 - Create compliance policies](deployment-plan-compliance-policies.md)
  - [Step 4 - Create device configuration profiles](deployment-plan-configuration-profile.md)

- **Review the current structure of your groups**. In Intune, you can create and assign policies to user groups, device groups, and dynamic user and device groups (requires Microsoft Entra ID P1 or P2).

  When you create groups in the cloud, like Intune or Microsoft 365, the groups are created in Microsoft Entra ID. You might not see the Microsoft Entra ID branding, but that's what you're using.

  - Creating new groups can be an easy task. They can be created in the [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431). For more information, go to [add groups to organize users and devices](groups-add.md).

  - Moving existing distribution lists (DL) to Microsoft Entra ID might be more challenging. Once they DLs are in Microsoft Entra ID, these groups are available to Intune and Microsoft 365. For more information, go to:

    - [What is hybrid identity with Microsoft Entra ID?](/entra/identity/hybrid/whatis-hybrid-identity)
    - [Microsoft Entra Connect Sync: Understand and customize synchronization](/entra/identity/hybrid/connect/how-to-connect-sync-whatis)

  - If you have existing Office 365 groups, you can move to Microsoft 365. Your existing groups remain, and you get all the features and services of Microsoft 365. For more information, go to:

    - [What is Microsoft 365?](/training/modules/what-is-m365/)
    - [Migration to Microsoft 365 Enterprise](/microsoft-365/enterprise/migration-microsoft-365-enterprise-workload)
    - [Upgrade to Microsoft 365 Business](/microsoft-365/business/migrate-to-microsoft-365-business)

- If you have multiple device management solutions, then **move to a single mobile device management solution**. We recommend using Intune to help protect organization data in apps and on devices.

## Step 5 - Create a rollout plan

The next task is to plan how and when your users and devices receive your policies. In this task, also consider:

- Define your goals and success metrics. Use these data points to create other rollout phases. Make sure goals are SMART (Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Realistic, and Timely). Plan to measure against your goals at each phase so your rollout project stays on track.
- Have clearly-defined goals and objectives. Include these objectives in all awareness and training activities so users understand why your organization chose Intune.

✅ **Task: Create a plan to roll out your policies**

And, choose how users enroll their devices in Intune. Some considerations:

- **Roll out your policies in phases**. For example:

  - Start with a pilot or test group. These groups should know they're the first users, and be willing to provide feedback. Use this feedback to improve configuration, documentation, notifications, and make it easier for users in a future rollout. These users shouldn't be executives or VIPs.

    After initial testing, add more users to the pilot group. Or, create more pilot groups that focus on a different rollout, such as:

    - **Departments**: Each department can be a rollout phase. You target an entire department at a time. In this rollout, users in each department might use their device in the same way, and access the same applications. Users likely have the same types of policies.

    - **Geography**: Deploy your policies to all users in a specific geography, whether it's the same continent, country/region, or same organization building. This rollout lets you focus on the specific location of users. You could provide a Windows Autopilot for pre-provisioned deployment approach, as the number of locations deploying Intune at the same time is less. There are chances of different departments or different use cases at the same location. So, you could be testing different use cases simultaneously.

    - **Platform**: This rollout deploys similar platforms at the same time. For example, deploy policies to all iOS/iPadOS devices in February, all Android devices in March, and all Windows devices in April. This approach might simplify help desk support, as they only support one platform at a time.

    Using a staged approach, you can get feedback from a wide range of user types.

  - After a successful pilot, you're ready to start a full production rollout. The following example is an Intune rollout plan that includes targeted groups and timelines:

  | Rollout phase | July | August | September | October |
  |:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
  | Limited Pilot | IT (50 users) |  |  |  |
  | Expanded Pilot | IT (200 users), IT Executives (10 users) |  |  |  |
  | Production rollout phase 1 |  | Sales and Marketing (2,000 users) |  |  |
  | Production rollout phase 2 |  |  | Retail (1,000 users) |  |
  | Production rollout phase 3 |  |  |  | HR (50 users), Finance (40 users), Executives (30 users) |

  This template is also available to download at [Intune deployment planning, design, and implementation - Table templates](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=103005).

- **Choose how users will enroll** their personal and organization-owned devices. There are different enrollment approaches you can use, including:

  - **User self-service**: Users enroll their own devices following steps provided by their IT organization. This approach is most common, and is more scalable than user-assisted enrollment.
  - **User-assisted enrollment**: In this pre-provisioned deployment approach, an IT member helps users through the enrollment process, in person or using Teams. This approach is common with executive staff and other groups that might need more assistance.
  - **IT tech fair**: At this event, the IT group sets up an Intune enrollment assistance booth. Users receive information on Intune enrollment, ask questions, and get help enrolling their devices. This option is beneficial for IT and users, especially during the early phases of an Intune rollout.

  The following example includes the enrollment approaches:

  | Rollout phase | July | August | September | October |
  |:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
  | Limited Pilot |  |  |  |  |
  | Self-service | IT |  |  |  |
  | Expanded Pilot |  |  |  |  |
  | Self-service | IT |  |  |  |
  | Pre-provisioned | IT Executives |  |  |  |
  | Production rollout phase 1 |  | Sales, Marketing |  |  |
  | Self-service |  | Sales and Marketing |  |  |
  | Production rollout phase 2 |  |  | Retail |  |
  | Self-service |  |  | Retail |  |
  | Production rollout phase 3 |  |  |  | Executives, HR, Finance |
  | Self-service |  |  |  | HR, Finance |
  | Pre-provisioned |  |  |  | Executives |

## Step 6 - Communicate changes

Change management relies on clear and helpful communications about upcoming changes. The idea is to have a smooth Intune deployment, and make users aware of changes & any disruption.

✅ **Task: Your rollout communication plan should include important information**

This information should include how to notify users, and when to communicate. Some considerations:

- **Determine what information to communicate**. Communicate in phases to your groups and users, starting with an Intune rollout kickoff, pre-enrollment, and then post-enrollment:

  - **Kickoff phase**: Broad communication that introduces the Intune project. It should answer key questions, like:
    - What is Intune?
    - Why the organization is using Intune, including benefits to the organization and to users
    - Provide a high-level plan of the deployment and rollout.
    - If personal devices aren't allowed *unless* the devices are enrolled, then explain why you made the decision.

  - **Pre-enrollment phase**: Broad communication that includes information about Intune and other services (like Office, Outlook, and OneDrive), user resources, and specific timelines when users and groups will enroll in Intune.

  - **Enrollment phase**: Communication targets organization users and groups that are scheduled to enroll in Intune. It should inform users that they're ready to enroll, include enrollment steps, and who to contact for help and questions.

  - **Post enrollment phase**: Communication targets organization users and groups that are enrolled in Intune. It should provide more resources that might be helpful to users, and collect feedback about their experience during and after enrollment.

- **Choose how to communicate** Intune rollout information to your targeted groups and users. For example:

  - Create an organization wide in-person meeting, or use Microsoft Teams.
  - Create an email for pre-enrollment, email for enrollment, and email for post-enrollment. For example:

    - **Email 1**: Explain the benefits, expectations, and schedule. Take this opportunity to showcase any other services whose access is granted on devices managed by Intune.
    - **Email 2**: Announce that services are now ready for access through Intune. Tell users to enroll now. Give users a timeline before their access is affected. Remind users of benefits and strategic reasons for migration.

  - Use an organization web site that explains the rollout phases, what users can expect, and who to contact for help.
  - Create posters, use organization social media platforms (like Microsoft Viva Engage), or distribute flyers to announce the pre-enrollment phase.

- **Create a timeline** that includes when and who. The first Intune kickoff communications can target the entire organization, or just a subset. They can take place over several weeks before the Intune rollout begins. After that, information could be communicated in phases to users and groups, aligned with their Intune rollout schedule.

  The following example is a high-level Intune rollout communications plan:

  | Communication plan | July | August | September | October |
  |:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
  | Phase 1  | All |  |  |  |
  | Kickoff meeting | First week |  |  |  |
  | Phase 2 | IT | Sales and Marketing | Retail | HR, Finance, and Executives |
  | Pre-rollout Email 1 | First week | First week | First week | First week |
  | Phase 3 | IT | Sales and Marketing | Retail | HR, Finance, and Executives |
  | Pre-rollout Email 2 | Second week | Second week | Second week | Second week |
  | Phase 4 | IT | Sales and Marketing | Retail | HR, Finance, and Executives |
  | Enrollment email | Third week | Third week | Third week | Third week |
  | Phase 5 | IT | Sales and Marketing | Retail | HR, Finance, and Executives |
  | Post-enrollment email | Fourth week | Fourth week | Fourth week | Fourth week |

## Step 7 - Support help desk and end users

Include your IT support and helpdesk in the early stages of Intune deployment planning and pilot efforts. Early involvement exposes your support staff to Intune, and they gain knowledge and experience in identifying and resolving issues more effectively. It also prepares them for supporting the organization's full production rollout. Knowledgeable help desk and support teams also help users adopt these changes.

✅ **Task: Train your support teams**

Validate the end-user experience with success metrics in your deployment plan. Some considerations:

- **Determine who will support end users**. Organizations can have different tiers or levels (1-3). For example, tier 1 and 2 might be part of the support team. Tier 3 includes members of the MDM team responsible for the Intune deployment.

  Tier 1 is typically the first level of support and the first tier to contact. If tier 1 can't resolve the issue, then they escalate to tier 2. Tier 2 escalates it to tier 3. [Microsoft support](../../get-support.md) might be considered as tier 4.

  - In the initial rollout phases, be sure all tiers in your support team document issues and resolutions. Look for patterns, and adjust your communications for the next rollout phase. For example:
    - If different users or groups are hesitant about enrolling their personal devices, consider a Teams calls to answer common questions.
    - If users are having the same issues enrolling organization-owned devices, then host an in-person event to help users enroll the devices.

- **Create a help desk workflow, and constantly communicate support issues**, trends, and other important information to all tiers in your support team. For example, hold daily or weekly Teams meetings so all tiers are aware of trends, patterns, and can get help.

  The following example shows how Contoso implements their IT support or helpdesk workflows:

  1. End-user contacts IT support or helpdesk tier 1 with an enrollment issue.
  2. IT support or helpdesk tier 1 can't determine the root cause and escalates to tier 2.
  3. IT support or helpdesk tier 2 investigates. Tier 2 can't resolve the issue and escalates to tier 3, and provides additional information to help with the issue.
  4. IT support or helpdesk tier 3 investigates, determines the root cause, and communicates the resolution to tier 2 and 1.
  5. IT support/helpdesk tier 1 then contacts the users, and resolves the issue.

  This approach, especially in early stages of the Intune rollout, adds many benefits, including:

  - Help learn the technology
  - Quickly identify issues and resolution
  - Improve the overall user experience

- **Train your help desk and support teams**. Have them enroll devices running the different platforms used in your organization so they're familiar with the process. Consider using help desk and support teams as a pilot group for your scenarios.

  There are training resources available, including [YouTube videos](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=intune+training), Microsoft tutorials about [Windows Autopilot scenarios](/autopilot/tutorial/autopilot-scenarios), [compliance](../protect/tutorial-protect-email-on-enrolled-devices.md), [configuration](../configuration/tutorial-walkthrough-administrative-templates.md), and courses through training partners.

  The following example is an Intune support training agenda:

  - Intune support plan review
  - Intune overview
  - Troubleshooting common issues
  - Tools and resources
  - Q & A

The community-based [Intune forum](https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/home) and [end-user documentation](/mem/intune/user-help/use-managed-devices-to-get-work-done) are also great resources.
