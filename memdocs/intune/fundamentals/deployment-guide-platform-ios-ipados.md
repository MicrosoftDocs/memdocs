# Deployment guide: Manage iOS/iPadOS devices in Microsoft Intune

Intune supports mobile device management (MDM) of iPads and iPhones to give users secure access to work email, data, and apps. This guide provides iOS-specific guidance to help you set up enrollment and deploy apps and policies to users and devices.      



## Prerequisites  

Before you begin, complete these prerequisites to enable iOS/iPadOS device management in Intune. For more detailed information about how to set up, onboard, or move to Intune, see the [Intune setup deployment guide](deployment-guide-intune-setup.md).          

* [Add users](users-add.md) and [groups](groups-add.md)
* [Assign licenses to users](licenses-assign.md) 
* [Set mobile device management authority](mdm-authority-set.md) 
* [Set up Apple MDM push (APNs) certificate](../enrollment/apple-mdm-push-certificate-get.md)  

For information about Microsoft Intune roles and permissions, see [RBAC with Microsoft Intune](../fundamentals/role-based-access-control.md). The Microsoft Entra [Global Administrator and Intune Administrator](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference) roles have full rights within Microsoft Intune. The Global Administrator has more permissions than needed for many device management tasks in Microsoft Intune. We recommend you use the least privileged role that's needed to complete tasks. For example, the least privileged role that can complete device enrollment tasks is the *Policy and Profile Manager*, a built-in Intune role.   

## Plan for your deployment  

The [Microsoft Intune planning guide](intune-planning-guide.md) provides guidance and advice to help you determine goals, use-case scenarios, and requirements. It also describes how to create plans for rollout, communication, support, testing, and validation.

## Leverage the iOS/iPadOS security configuration framework 

The iOS/iPadOS security configuration framework is a series of recommendations for device compliance and configuration policy settings. These recommendations help you tailor your organization's mobile device security protection to your specific needs.

Microsoft Intune uses a taxonomy for this framework that's similar to the one used for security configurations in Windows 10. It applies to both personally owned and supervised devices, and includes the recommended settings for basic, enhanced, and high-level security. Each security level builds off the previous one and offers more protection than the last. 

The security levels for personally owned devices are:  

* Basic security (Level 1) – This configuration is recommended as the minimum security configuration for personal devices from which users access work or school data. This configuration enforces password policies, defines device lock characteristics, and disables certain device functions (such as untrusted certificates). 

* Enhanced security (Level 2) – This configuration is recommended for devices from which users access sensitive or confidential information. This configuration enacts data sharing controls. It's applicable to most mobile users accessing work or school data on a device.  

* High security (Level 3) – This configuration is recommended for devices used by specific users or groups who are uniquely high risk. For example, users who handle highly sensitive data where unauthorized disclosure causes considerable material loss to the organization. This configuration enacts stronger password policies than the previous levels, disables more device functions, and enforces additional data transfer restrictions. 

The security levels for supervised devices are:  

* Basic security (Level 1) – This configuration is recommended as the minimum security configuration for supervised devices where users access work or school data. This level is achieved by enforcing password policies, defining device lock characteristics, and disabling certain device functions (such as untrusted certificates). 

* Enhanced security (Level 2) – This configuration is recommended for devices from which users access sensitive or confidential information. This configuration enacts data sharing controls and blocks access to USB devices. It's applicable to most mobile users accessing work or school data on a device. 

* High security (Level 3) – This configuration is recommended for devices used by specific users or groups who are uniquely high risk.  For example, users who handle highly sensitive data where unauthorized disclosure causes considerable material loss to the organization. This configuration enacts stronger password policies, disables more device functions, enforces additional data transfer restrictions, and requires apps to be installed through the Apple volume purchase program (VPP). 

For more information about the security framework, including specific recommendations and the minimum apps that must be protected, see the articles listed in the following table. 

| Task | Detail | 
| ---- | ------ |  
| [Disallow personal accounts for Microsoft apps on iOS/iPadOS devices](../enrollment/ios-ipados-app-configuration-policies.md) |Configure an app policy that prevents users from signing into a personal account on a work or school device. |  
| [Configure device compliance security settings](../enrollment/ios-ipados-device-compliance-security-configurations.md)|Apply these security settings to configure a basic or high security level on personally owned and corporate owned devices. |  
|[Configure device security settings for personal devices ](../enrollment/ios-ipados-personal-device-security-configurations.md)  | Apply these settings to configure a basic, enhanced, or high security level on personally owned devices. | 
|[Configure device security settings for supervised devices ](../enrollment/ios-ipados-supervised-device-security-configurations.md)  | Apply these settings to configure a basic, enhanced, or high security level on supervised devices. | -->  


## Create compliance rules  

Use compliance policies to define the rules and conditions that users and devices should meet to access your protected resources. If you use Conditional Access, your Conditional Access policies can use your device compliance results to block access to resources from noncompliant devices. For a detailed explanation about compliance policies and how to get started, see [Use compliance policies to set rules for devices you manage with Intune](../protect/device-compliance-get-started.md).  

| Task | Detail | 
| ---- | ------ | 
| [Create a compliance policy](../protect/create-compliance-policy.md)|Get step-by-step guidance on how to create and assign a compliance policy to user and device groups.   |       
| [Add actions for noncompliance](../protect/actions-for-noncompliance.md) |Choose what happens when devices no longer meet the conditions of your compliance policy. You can add actions for noncompliance when you configure a device compliance policy, or later by editing the policy.    |  
| Create [a device-based](../protect/create-conditional-access-intune.md) or [app-based](../protect/app-based-conditional-access-intune-create.md) Conditional Access policy| Specify the app or services you want to protect and define the conditions for access. |  
|[Block access to apps that don't use modern authentication](../protect/app-modern-authentication-block.md)  | Create an app-based Conditional Access policy to block apps that use authentication methods other than OAuth2; for example, those apps that use basic and form-based authentication. Before you block access, however, sign in to Microsoft Entra ID and review the [authentication methods activity report](/azure/active-directory/authentication/howto-authentication-methods-activity) to see if users are using basic authentication to access essential things you forgot about or are unaware of. For example, things like meeting room calendar kiosks use basic authentication.  |
