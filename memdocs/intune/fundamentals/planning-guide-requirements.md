# Determine use-case scenario requirements

In this section, you determine the requirements for each organizational group within each use-case scenario. This process helps you prepare for the other Intune deployment planning areas like architecture and design, onboarding, and rollout. It can also help identify potential gaps and challenges related to your Intune deployment project.

You might have different sets of requirements for each of your use-case and sub-use-case scenarios, and their associated organizational groups and mobile device platforms. For example, your corporate use-case scenario requirements might require devices to enroll into Intune with a more restrictive set of device settings, like a PIN of 6 characters or disabled cloud backup. Your "bring your own device" (BYOD) use-case scenario, may be less restrictive and allow a 4-character PIN and cloud backup.

You may also have organizational groups for the corporate use-case scenario that have different sets of requirements (for example, PIN settings, Wi-Fi or VPN profile, apps deployed). Your requirements may also be determined by the capabilities of the mobile device platform (for example, finger print reader, email profile).

Here are a few examples of an organization's use-case requirements showing different sets of requirements for each use-case and sub-use-case scenario, organizational group, and mobile device platform. You can also use the following table to enter your organization's use-case requirements:

| **Use cases** | **Sub-use cases** | **Groups** | **Device platforms** | **Requirements** |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Corporate | Information worker | HR, Finance | iOS/iPadOS | Secure e-mail, device settings, profiles, apps |                                                          
| Corporate | Executives | HR, Finance | iOS/iPadOS | Secure e-mail, device settings, profiles, apps |                                                         
| Corporate | Kiosk | Retail | Android | Device settings, profiles, apps |
| BYOD | Information worker | Marketing, Sales | iOS/iPadOS | Secure e-mail, device settings, profiles, apps |                                                         
| BYOD | Executives | Marketing, Sales | iOS/iPadOS | Secure e-mail, device settings, profiles, apps |
