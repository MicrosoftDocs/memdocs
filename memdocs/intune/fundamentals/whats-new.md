#### Government tenant support for endpoint security Application Control policy and managed installer<!-- 24850055   -->  
We’ve added support to use endpoint security [Application Control policies](../protect/endpoint-security-app-control-policy.md), and to configure a managed installer, to the following sovereign cloud environments:

- US Government clouds
- 21Vianet in China

Support for Application Control policy and managed installers was originally [released in preview in June 2023](../fundamentals/whats-new.md#new-endpoint-security-application-control-policy-in-preview). Application Control policies in Intune are an implementation of Defender Application Control (WDAC).

### Device security

#### Endpoint Privilege Management support for Windows 365 devices<!-- 17016794  -->  
You can now use [Endpoint Privilege Management](../protect/epm-overview.md) to manage application elevations on Windows 365 devices (also known as Cloud PCs).

This support does not include Azure Virtual Desktop.

#### Elevation report by Publisher for Endpoint Privilege Management<!--  24593400  -->  
We’ve released a new report named **Elevation report by Publisher** for Endpoint Privilege Management (EPM). With [this new report](../protect/epm-reports.md#elevation-report-by-publisher) you can view all managed and unmanaged elevations, which are aggregated by the publisher of the app that is elevated.

You’ll find the report in the Report node for EPM in the [Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431). Navigate to **Endpoint security** > **Endpoint Privilege Management** and then select the **Reports** tab.

#### macOS support with Intune Endpoint security policies for Endpoint detection and response<!--  17757981 -->  
Intune Endpoint security policies for *Endpoint detection  and response* (EDR) now support macOS. To enable this support, we’ve added a new [EDR template profile for macOS](../protect/endpoint-security-edr-policy.md#devices-managed-by-microsoft-intune) that you can use with macOS devices enrolled with Intune and macOS devices managed through the opt-in public preview of the [Defender for Endpoint security settings management](../protect/mde-security-integration.md?pivots=mdssc-preview) scenario.

The EDR template for macOS includes the following settings for the *Device tags* category from Defender for Endpoint:

- **Type of  tag**  – The GROUP tag, tags the device with the specified value. The tag is reflected in the admin center on the device page and can be used for filtering and grouping devices.
- **Value of tag** - Only one value per tag can be set. The Type of a tag is unique and shouldn’t be repeated in the same profile.

To learn more about Defender for Endpoint settings that are available for macOS, see [Set preferences for Microsoft Defender for Endpoint on macOS](/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/mac-preferences#device-tags) in the Defender documentation.

#### Linux support with Intune Endpoint security policies for Endpoint detection and response<!--  17757972  -->  
Intune Endpoint security policies for *Endpoint detection  and response* (EDR) now support Linux. To enable this support, we’ve added a new [EDR template profile for Linux](../protect/endpoint-security-edr-policy.md#devices-managed-by-microsoft-intune) that you can use with Linux devices enrolled with Intune and Linux devices managed through the opt-in public preview of the [Defender for Endpoint security settings management](../protect/mde-security-integration.md?pivots=mdssc-preview) scenario.

The EDR template for Linux includes the following settings for the *Device tags* category from Defender for Endpoint:

- **Value of tag** - Only one value per tag can be set. The Type of a tag is unique and shouldn’t be repeated in the same profile.
- **Type of  tag**  – The GROUP tag, tags the device with the specified value. The tag is reflected in the admin center on the device page and can be used for filtering and grouping devices.

You can learn more about Defender for Endpoint settings that are available for Linux in [Set preferences for Microsoft Defender for Endpoint on Linux](/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/linux-preferences#device-tags) in the Defender documentation.

### Monitor and troubleshoot 

#### Updated reports for Update rings for Windows 10 and later<!-- 10159960 -->  
Reporting for [Update rings for Windows 10 and later](../protect/windows-10-update-rings.md) has been updated to use Intune’s improved reporting infrastructure. These changes align to similar improvements introduced for other Intune features.

With this change for reports for Update rings for Windows 10 and later, when you select an update rings policy in the Intune admin center, there is no more left-pane navigation for *Overview*, *Manage*, or *Monitor* options. Instead, the policy view opens to a single pane that includes the following policy details:

- **Essentials** – including the policy name, created and modified dates, and additional details.
- **Device and user check-in status**  – This is the default report view and includes:
  - A  high-level overview of device status for this policy, and a *View report* button to open a more comprehensive report view.
  - A streamlined representation and count of the different device status values returned by devices assigned to the policy. The simplified bar and chart replace former doughnut charts seen in the prior reporting representation.
- Two additional report tiles to open additional reports. These include:
  - **Device assignment status** – This report combines the same information as the previous Device status and User status reports, which are no longer available. However, with this change, pivots and drill-in through based on the user name is no longer available.
  - **Per setting status** – This new report provides success metrics for each setting configured differently than the defaults, allowing for new insight to which settings may not be successfully deploying to your organization.
- **Properties** – View details for each configuration page of the policy, including an option to **Edit** each areas profile details.

For more information about reports for update rings for Windows 10 and later, see [Reports for Update rings for Windows 10 and later policy](../protect/windows-update-reports.md#reports-for-update-rings-for-windows-10-and-later-policy) in the Windows Update reports for Microsoft Intune article. 


### Role-based access

#### Updating the scope of UpdateEnrollment<!--25077072 -->  
With the introduction of a new role **UpdateEnrollment**, the scope of **UpdateOnboarding** is getting updated.

The **UpdateOnboarding** setting for custom and built-in roles is modified to only manage or change the Android Enterprise binding to Managed Google Play and other account-wide configurations. Any built in roles that used **UpdateOnboarding** will now have **UpdateEnrollmentProfiles** included.

The resource name is being updated from **Android for work** to **Android Enterprise**.

For more information, see [Role-based access control (RBAC) with Microsoft Intune](../fundamentals/role-based-access-control.md).

## Week of September 11, 2023

### Device configuration

#### Introducing Remote Launch on Remote Help<!--9843475 -->

With Remote Launch, the helper can launch Remote Help seamlessly on the helper and user's device from Intune by sending a notification to the user's device. This allows both helpdesk and the sharer to be connected to a session quickly without exchanging session codes.

For more information, go to [Remote Help](../fundamentals/remote-help-windows.md)

Applies to:

- Windows 10/11

## Week of September 4, 2023

### Device management

#### Microsoft Intune ending support for Android device administrator on devices with GMS access in August 2024<!--13891824 -->

Microsoft Intune is ending support for [Android device administrator management](../enrollment/android-enroll-device-administrator.md) on devices with access to Google Mobile Services (GMS) on August 30, 2024. After that date, device enrollment, technical support, bug fixes, and security fixes will be unavailable.  

If you currently use device administrator management, we recommend switching to another Android management option in Intune before support ends.
For more information, read [Ending support for Android device administrator on GMS devices](https://aka.ms/Intune-Android-DA-blog).

## Week of August 28, 2023

### Device configuration

#### Windows and Android support for 4096-bit key size for SCEP and PFX certificate profiles<!--16314561  -->

Intune [SCEP certificate profiles](../protect/certificates-profile-scep.md) and [PKCS certificate profiles](../protect/certificates-pfx-configure.md) for Windows and Android devices now support a **Key size (bits)** of **4096**. This key size is available for new profiles and existing profiles you choose to edit.

- SCEP profiles have always included the *Key size (bits)* setting and now support 4096 as an available configuration option.
- PKCS profiles don't include the *Key size (bits)* setting directly. Instead, an admin must [modify the certificate template on the Certification Authority](../protect/certificates-pfx-configure.md#configure-certificate-templates-on-the-ca) to set the *Minimum key size* to 4096.

If you use a third-party Certificate Authority (CA), you might need to contact your vendor for assistance with implementing the 4096-bit key size.

When updating or deploying new certificate profiles to take advantage of this new key size, we recommend use of a staggered deployment approach to help avoid creating excessive demand for new certificates across a large number of devices at the same time.

With this update, be aware of the following limitations on Windows devices:

- 4096-bit key storage is supported only in the *Software Key Storage Provider* (KSP). The following do not support storing keys of this size:
  - The hardware TPM (Trusted Platform Module). As a workaround you can use the Software KSP for key storage.
  - Windows Hello for Business. There is no work around at this time.

### Tenant administration

#### Access policies for multiple Administrator Approval are now generally available<!-- 24936423   -->  
Access policies for multiple Administrator Approval are out of public preview and are now generally available. With these policies you can protect a resource, like App deployments, by requiring any change to the deployment be approved by one of a group of users who are *approvers* for the resource, before that change is applied.

For more information, see [Use Access policies to require multiple administrative approval](../fundamentals/multi-admin-approval.md).

## Week of August 21, 2023 (Service release 2308)

### App management

#### Managed Home Screen end-users prompted to grant exact alarm permission<!-- 19804494 -->  
Managed Home Screen uses the exact alarm permission to do the following actions:

- Automatically sign users out after a set time of inactivity on the device
- Launch a screen saver after a set period of inactivity
- Automatically relaunch MHS after a certain period of time when a user exits kiosk mode

For devices running Android 14 and higher, by default, the exact alarm permission will be denied. To make sure critical user functionality is not impacted, end-users will be prompted to grant exact alarm permission upon first launch of Managed Home Screen. For more information, see [Configure the Microsoft Managed Home Screen app for Android Enterprise](..\apps\app-configuration-managed-home-screen-app.md) and [Android's developer documentation]( https://developer.android.com/about/versions/14/changes/schedule-exact-alarms).

#### Managed Home Screen notifications<!-- 19805777  -->  
For Android devices running Android 13 or higher that target API level 33, by default, applications do not have permission to send notifications. In previous versions of Managed Home Screen, when an admin had enabled automatic relaunch of Managed Home Screen, a notification was displayed to alert users of the relaunch. To accommodate change to notification permission, in the scenario when an admin has enabled auto-relaunch of Managed Home Screen, the application will now display a toast message alerting users of the relaunch. Managed Home Screen is able to auto-grant permission for this notification, so no change is required for admins configuring Managed Home Screen to accommodate the change in notification permission with API level 33. For more information about Android 13 (API level 33) notification messages, see the [Android developer documentation](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/views/notifications/notification-permission). For more information about Managed Home Screen, see [Configure the Microsoft Managed Home Screen app for Android Enterprise](../apps/app-configuration-managed-home-screen-app.md).

#### New macOS web clip app type<!-- 24128407  -->

#### Win32 app configurable installation time<!-- 17644704  -->  
In Intune, you can set a configurable installation time to deploy Win32 apps. This time is expressed in minutes. If the app takes longer to install than the set installation time, the system will fail the app install. Max timeout value is 1440 minutes (1 day). For more information about Win32 apps, see [Win32 app management in Microsoft Intune](../apps/apps-win32-add.md#step-2-program).

#### Samsung Knox conditional launch check<!-- 8610063   -->  
You can add additional detection of device health compromises on Samsung Knox devices. Using a conditional launch check within a new Intune App Protection Policy, you can require that hardware-level device tamper detection and device attestation be performed on compatible Samsung devices. For more information, see the **Samsung Knox device attestation** setting in the **Conditional launch** section of [Android app protection policy settings in Microsoft Intune](../apps/app-protection-policy-settings-android.md#device-conditions).

### Device enrollment

#### Just-in-time registration and compliance remediation for iOS/iPadOS Setup Assistant with modern authentication now generally available<!-- 16276610 -->  
Just in time registration and compliance remediation for Setup Assistant with modern authentication are now out of preview and generally available. With just in time (JIT) registration, the device user doesn't need to use the Company Portal app for Azure Active Directory registration and compliance checking. JIT registration and compliance remediation is embedded into the user's provisioning experience, so they can view their compliance status and take action within the work app they're trying to access. Additionally, this establishes single-sign on across the device. For more information about how to set up JIT registration, see [Set up Just in Time Registration](../enrollment/automated-device-enrollment-authentication.md#set-up-just-in-time-registration).

#### Awaiting final configuration for iOS/iPadOS automated device enrollment now generally available<!-- 17473384  -->  
Now generally available, *awaiting final configuration* enables a locked experience at the end of Setup Assistant to ensure that critical device configuration policies install on devices. The locked experience works on devices targeted with new and existing enrollment profiles. Supported devices include:

- iOS/iPadOS 13+ devices enrolling with Setup Assistant with modern authentication
- iOS/iPadOS 13+ devices enrolling without user affinity  
- iOS/iPadOS 13+ devices enrolling with Azure AD shared mode  

This setting is applied once during the out-of-box automated device enrollment experience in Setup Assistant. The device user doesn't experience it again unless they re-enroll their device.  Awaiting final configuration is enabled by default for new enrollment profiles. For information about how to enable awaiting final configuration, see [Create an Apple enrollment profile](..//enrollment/device-enrollment-program-enroll-ios.md#create-an-apple-enrollment-profile).

### Device management

#### Changes to Android notification permission prompt behavior<!-- 19783177  -->  
We've updated how our Android apps handle notification permissions to align with recent changes made by Google to the Android platform.  As a result of Google changes, notification permissions are granted to apps as follows:

- **On devices running Android 12 and earlier**: Apps are permitted to send notifications to users by default.
- **On devices running Android 13 and later**: Notification permissions vary depending on the API the app targets.
  - *Apps targeting API 32 and lower*: Google has added a notification permission prompt that appears when the user opens the app. Management apps can still configure apps so that they're automatically granted notification permissions.
  - *Apps targeting API 33 and higher*: App developers define when the notification permission prompts appear. Management apps can still configure apps so that they're automatically granted notification permissions.

You and your device users can expect to see the following changes now that our apps target API 33:

- **Company Portal used for work profile management**: Users see a notification permission prompt in the personal instance of the Company Portal when they first open it. Users don't see a notification permission prompt in the work profile instance of Company Portal because notification permissions are automatically permitted for Company Portal in the work profile. Users can silence app notifications in the Settings app.
- **Company Portal used for device administrator management**: Users see a notification permission prompt when they first open the Company Portal app.  Users can adjust app notification settings in the Settings app.
- **Microsoft Intune app**: No changes to existing behavior. Users don't see a prompt because notifications are automatically permitted for the Microsoft Intune app.  Users can adjust some app notification settings in the Settings app.
- **Microsoft Intune app for AOSP**: No changes to existing behavior. Users don't see a prompt because notifications are automatically permitted for the Microsoft Intune app.  Users can't adjust app notification settings in the Settings app.

### Device security

#### Defender Update controls to deploy updates for Defender is now generally available<!-- 24666660 -->  
The profile **Defender Update controls** for Intune Endpoint security Antivirus policy, which manages update settings for Microsoft Defender, is now generally available. This profile is available for the *Windows 10, Windows 11, and Windows Server* platform. While in public preview, this profile was available for the *Windows 10 and later* platform.

The profile includes settings for the rollout release channel by which devices and users receive Defender Updates that are related to daily security intelligence updates, monthly platform updates, and monthly engine updates.

This profile includes the following settings, which are all directly taken from [Defender CSP - Windows Client Management](/windows/client-management/mdm/policy-csp-Defender).

- Engine Updates Channel

These settings are also available from the [settings catalog](../configuration/settings-catalog.md) for the *Windows 10 and later* profile.

#### Elevation report by applications for Endpoint Privilege Management<!-- 24593324 -->  
We've released a new report named **Elevation report by applications** for Endpoint Privilege Management (EPM). With [this new report](../protect/epm-reports.md#elevation-report-by-applications) you can view all managed and unmanaged elevations, which are aggregated by the application that elevated. This report can aid you in identifying applications that might require elevation rules to function properly, including rules for child processes.

You'll find the report in the Report node for EPM in the [Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431). Navigate to **Endpoint security** > **Endpoint Privilege Management** and then select the **Reports** tab.

#### New settings available for macOS Antivirus policy<!-- 24191427 -->  
The [Microsoft Defender Antivirus](../protect/endpoint-security-antivirus-policy.md) profile for macOS devices has been updated with nine additional settings, and three new settings categories:

**Antivirus engine** – The following settings are new in this this category:

- **Degree of parallelism for on-demand scans** – Specifies the degree of parallelism for on-demand scans. This corresponds to the number of threads used to perform the scan and impacts the CPU usage, as well as the duration of the on-demand scan.
- **Enable file hash computation** – Enables or disables file hash computation feature. When this feature is enabled Windows defender will compute hashes for files it scans. This will help in improving the accuracy of Custom Indicator matches. However, enabling Enable file hash computation may impact device performance.
- **Run a scan after definitions are updated** – Specifies whether to start a process scan after new security intelligence updates are downloaded on the device. Enabling this setting will trigger an antivirus scan on the running processes of the device.
- **Scanning inside archive files** – If true, Defender will unpack archives and scan files inside them. Otherwise archive content will be skipped, that will improve scanning performance.

**Network protection** – A new category that includes the following setting:

- **Enforcement level** – Configure this setting to specify if network protection is *disabled*, *in audit mode*, or *enforced*.

**Tamper  protection** - A new category that includes the following setting:

- **Enforcement level** - Specify if tamper protection is *disabled*, in *audit mode*, or *enforced*.

**User interface preferences** – A new category that includes the following settings:

- **Control sign-in to consumer version** - Specify whether users can sign into the consumer version of Microsoft Defender.
- **Show / hide status menu icon** – Specify whether the status menu icon (shown in the top-right corner of the screen) is hidden or not.
- **User initiated feedback** – Specify whether users can submit feedback to Microsoft by going to *Help* > *Send Feedback*.

New profiles that you create include the original settings as well as the new settings. Your existing profiles automatically update to include the new settings, with each new setting set to *Not configured* until you choose to edit that profile to change it.

Log file:
- %temp%\CloudDesktop\*.log

#### Anomaly detection device cohorts in Intune Endpoint analytics is generally available <!-- 24577118  -->  
Anomaly detection device cohorts in Intune Endpoint analytics is now generally available.

Device cohorts are identified in devices associated with a high or medium severity anomaly. Devices are correlated into groups based on one or more factors they have in common like an app version, driver update, OS version, device model. A correlation group will contain a detailed view with key information about the common factors between all affected devices in that group. You can also view a breakdown of devices currently affected by the anomaly and 'at risk' devices, those that haven't yet shown symptoms of the anomaly.

For more information, go to [Anomaly detection in Endpoint analytics](../../analytics/anomaly-detection.md#anomalies-tab).

#### Improved user experience for device timeline in Endpoint Analytics<!-- 24604944 -->  
The user interface (UI) for device timeline in Endpoint analytics is improved and includes more advanced capabilities (support for sorting, searching, filtering, and exports). When viewing a specific device timeline in Endpoint analytics, you can search by event name or details. You can also filter the events and choose the source and level of events that appear on the device timeline and select a time range of interest.

For more information, go to [Enhanced device timeline](../../analytics/enhanced-device-timeline.md).

#### Updates for compliance policies and reports<!--15425771  -->  
We've made several improvements to the Intune compliance policies and reports. With these changes the reports more closely align to the experience in use for device configuration profiles and reports. We've updated our [compliance report documentation](../protect/compliance-policy-monitor.md) to reflect the available compliance report improvements.

Compliance report improvements include:

- Compliance details for Linux devices.
- Redesigned reports that are up-to-date and simplified, with newer report versions beginning to replace older report versions, which will remain available for some time.
- When viewing a policy for compliance, there is no more left-pane navigation. Instead, the policy view opens to a single pane that defaults to the Monitor tab and its Device status view.
  - This view provides a high-level overview of device status for this policy, and supports drilling in to review the full report, as well as a per-setting status view of the same policy.
  - The doughnut chart is replaced by a streamlined representation and count of the different device status values returned by devices assigned the policy.
  - You can select the Properties tab to view the policy details, and review and edit its configuration and assignments.
  - The *Essentials* section is removed with those details appearing in the policy's *Properties* tab.
- The updated status reports support sorting by columns, the use of filters, and search. Combined, these enhancements enable you to pivot the report to display specific subsets of details you want to view at that time. With these enhancements we have removed the *User status* report as it has become redundant. Now, while viewing the default *Device status* report you can focus the report to display the same information that was available from *User status* by sorting on the *User Principal Name* column, or searching for a specific username in the search box.
- When viewing status reports, the count of devices that Intune displays now remains consistent between different report views as you drill in for deeper insights or details.

For more information about these changes, see the Intune Support Team blog at [https://aka.ms/Intune/device_compl_report](https://aka.ms/Intune/device_compl_report).

### App management

#### Use the Turn off the Store application setting to disable end user access to Store apps, and allow managed Intune Store apps<!-- 16544362 -->  
In Intune, you can use the new **Store app** type to deploy Store apps to your devices.

Now, you can use the **Turn off the Store application** policy to disable end users' direct access to Store apps. When it's disabled, end users can still access and install Store apps from the Windows Company Portal app and through Intune app management. If you want to allow random store app installs outside of Intune, then don't configure this policy.

The previous **Only display the private store within the Microsoft Store app** policy doesn't prevent end users from directly accessing the store using the Windows Package Manager `winget` APIs. So, if your goal is to block random unmanaged Store application installs on client devices, then it's recommended to use the **Turn off the Store application** policy. Don't use the **Only display the private store within the Microsoft Store app** policy.

For more information, go to [Add Microsoft Store Apps to Microsoft Intune](../apps/store-apps-microsoft.md).

Applies to:

- Windows 10 and later

## Week of August 7, 2023

#### Compliance Retrieval service support for MAC address endpoints<!--  24332824  -->  
We've now added MAC address support to the Compliance Retrieval service.

The initial release of the CR service included support for using only the Intune device ID with the intent to eliminate the need to manage internal identifiers like serial numbers and MAC addresses. With this update, organizations that prefer to use MAC addresses over certificate authentication may continue to do so while implementing the CR service.

While this update adds MAC address support to the CR service, our recommendation is to use certificate-based authentication with the Intune device ID included in the certificate.

For information about the CR service as a replacement for the Intune Network Access Control (NAC) service, see the Intune blog at [https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/intune-customer-success/new-microsoft-intune-service-for-network-access-control/ba-p/2544696](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/intune-customer-success/new-microsoft-intune-service-for-network-access-control/ba-p/2544696).

Navigate to **Endpoint security** > **Security baselines**. While creating and editing a workflow these insights are available for all settings with light bulbs.

### Device security

#### Tamper protection support for Windows on Azure Virtual Desktop<!--15135590  -->  
Intune now supports use of endpoint security [Antivirus policy](../protect/endpoint-security-antivirus-policy.md#prerequisites-for-tamper-protection) to manage *Tamper protection* for Windows on Azure Virtual Desktop multi-session devices. Support for Tamper protection requires devices to onboard to Microsoft Defender for Endpoint before the policy that enables Tamper protection is applied.

#### EpmTools PowerShell module for Endpoint Privilege Management<!-- 22800379  -->  
The EpmTools PowerShell module is now available for use with Intune Endpoint Privilege Management (EPM). EpmTools includes the cmdlets like **Get-FileAttributes** that you can use to retrieve file details to help build accurate elevation rules, and additional cmdlets you can use to troubleshoot or diagnose EPM policy deployments.

For more information, see [EpmTools PowerShell module](../protect/epm-overview.md#epmtools-powershell-module).

#### Endpoint Privilege Management support to manage elevation rules for child processes<!-- 15931887 -->  
With Intune Endpoint Privilege Management (EPM) you can manage which files and processes are allowed to *Run as Administrator* on your Windows devices.  Now, EPM [elevation rules](../protect/epm-policies.md#create-a-windows-elevation-rules-policy) support a new setting, **Child process behavior**.

With *Child process behavior*, your rules can manage the elevation context for any child processes created by the managed process. Options include:

- Allowing all child processes created by the managed process to always run as elevated.
- Allow a child process to run as elevated only when it matches the rule that manages its parent process.
- Deny all child processes from running in an elevated context, in which case they run as standard users.

Endpoint Privilege Management is available as an Intune add-on. For more information, see [Use Intune Suite add-on capabilities](../fundamentals/intune-add-ons.md).

### Device management

#### Intune support for Zebra devices on Android 13<!-- 17192763 -->  
Zebra will be releasing support for Android 13 on their devices. You can read more at [Migrating to Android 13](https://techdocs.zebra.com/lifeguard/a13/) (opens Zebra's web site).

- **Temporary issues on Android 13**

  The Intune team thoroughly tested Android 13 on Zebra devices. Everything continues working as normal, except for the following two temporary issues for device administrator (DA) devices.

  For Zebra devices running Android 13 and enrolled with DA management:

  1. App installations don't happen silently. Instead, users get a notification from the Company Portal app (if they allow notifications) that asks for permission to allow the app installation. If a user doesn't accept the app installation when prompted, then the app doesn't install. Users will have a persistent notification in the notification drawer until they allow the installation.

  2. New MX profiles don't apply to Android 13 devices. Newly enrolled Android 13 devices don't receive configuration from MX profiles. MX profiles that previously applied to enrolled devices continue to apply.

  In an update coming later in July, these issues will be resolved and the behavior will return to how it was before.

- **Update devices to Android 13**

  You will soon be able to use Intune's Zebra LifeGuard Over-the-Air integration to update Android Enterprise dedicated and fully managed devices to Android 13. For more information, go to [Zebra LifeGuard Over-the-Air Integration with Microsoft Intune](../protect/zebra-lifeguard-ota-integration.md).

  Before you migrate to Android 13, review [Migrating to Android 13](https://techdocs.zebra.com/lifeguard/a13/) (opens Zebra's web site).

- **OEMConfig for Zebra devices on Android 13**

  OEMConfig for Zebra devices on Android 13 requires using Zebra's new [Zebra OEMConfig Powered by MX OEMConfig app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.zebra.oemconfig.release) (opens the Google Play store). This new app can also be used on Zebra devices running Android 11, but not earlier versions.

  For more information on this app, go to the [New Zebra OEMConfig app for Android 11 and later](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/intune-customer-success/new-zebra-oemconfig-app-for-android-11-and-later/ba-p/3846730) blog post.

  The [Legacy Zebra OEMConfig app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.zebra.oemconfig.common) (opens the Google Play store) can only be used on Zebra devices running Android 11 and earlier.

For more general information about Intune Android 13 support, go to the [Day Zero support for Android 13 with Microsoft Intune](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/intune-customer-success/day-zero-support-for-android-13-with-microsoft-intune/ba-p/3601760) blog post.

### Device security

#### Defender for Endpoint security settings management enhancements and support for Linux and macOS in public preview<!-- 14743017, 15319901, 18713045, 18713050, 17757959 17757967, 17758270  -->  
With [Defender for Endpoint security settings management](../protect/mde-security-integration.md), you can use Intune's endpoint security policies to manage Defender security settings on devices that onboard to Defender for Endpoint but aren't enrolled with Intune.

Now, you can opt-in to a public preview from within the Microsoft 365 Defender portal to gain access to several enhancements for this scenario:

- Intune's endpoint security policies become visible in and can be managed from within the Microsoft 365 Defender portal. This enables security admins to remain in the Defender portal to manage Defender and the Intune endpoint security policies for Defender security settings management.

- Security settings management supports deploying Intune endpoint security Antivirus policies to devices that run Linux and macOS.

- For Windows devices, the Windows Security Experience profile is now supported with security settings management.

- A new onboarding workflow removes the Hybrid Azure AD Join prerequisite. Hybrid Azure AD Join requirements prevented many Windows devices from successfully onboarding to Defender for Endpoint security settings management. With this change, those devices can now complete enrollment and start processing policies for security settings management.

- Intune creates a synthetic registration in Azure AD for devices that can't fully register with Azure AD. Synthetic registrations are device objects created in Azure AD that enable devices to receive and report back on Intune policies for security settings management. In addition, should a device with a synthetic registration become fully registered, the synthetic registration is removed form Azure AD in deference to the full registration.

If you don't opt-in to the Defender for Endpoint Public Preview, the previous behaviors remain in place. In this case, while you can view the Antivirus profiles for Linux, you can't deploy it as its supported only for devices managed by Defender. Similarly, the macOS profile which is currently available for devices enrolled with Intune can't be deployed to devices managed by Defender.

Applies to:

- Linux
- macOS
- Windows

### Device management

#### Windows Driver update management in Intune is generally available<!-- 5584639  -->  
Announcing the general availability of **Windows Driver update management** in Microsoft Intune. With driver update policies, you can view a list of driver updates that are recommended and applicable to your Windows 10 and Windows 11 device that are assigned to the policy. Applicable driver updates are those that can update a device's driver version. Driver update policies update automatically to add new updates as they are published by the driver manufacturer and remove older drivers that no longer apply to any device with the policy.

Update policies can be configured for one of two approval methods:

- With *Automatic approval*, each new *recommended* driver that's published by the driver manufacturer and added to the policy is automatically approved for deployment to applicable devices. Policies set for automatic approvals can be configured with a deferral period before the automatically approved updates are installed on devices. This deferral gives you time to review the driver and to pause its deployment if necessary.

- With *manual approval*, all new driver updates are automatically added to the policy, but an admin must explicitly approve each update before Windows Update deploys it to a device. When you manually approve an update, you choose the date when Windows Update will begin to deploy it to your devices.

To help you manage driver updates, you review a policy and decline an update you don't want to install, indefinitely pause any approved update,  and reapprove a paused update to restart its deployment.

This release also includes [driver update reports](../protect/windows-update-reports.md#reports-for-windows-driver-updates-policy) that provide a success summary, per-device update status for each approved driver, and error and troubleshooting information. You can also select an individual driver update and view details about it across all the policies that include that driver version.

To learn about using Windows Driver update policies, see [Manage policy for Windows Driver updates with Microsoft Intune](../protect/windows-driver-updates-overview.md).

Applies to:

- Windows 10

#### New endpoint security Application Control policy in preview<!-- 15711976 -->  
As a public preview, you can use a new endpoint security policy category, Application Control. Endpoint security Application Control policy includes:

- Policy to set the Intune Management Extension as a tenant-wide managed installer. When enabled as a managed installer, apps you deploy through Intune (after enablement of Managed Installer) to Windows devices are tagged as installed by Intune. This tag becomes useful when you use Application Control policies to manage which apps you want to allow or block from running on your managed devices.

- Application Control policies that are an implementation of Defender Application Control (WDAC). With Endpoint security Application Control policies, it's easy to configure policy that allows trusted apps to run on your managed devices. Trusted apps are installed by a managed installer or from the App store. In addition to built-in trust settings, these policies also support custom XML for application control so you can allow other apps from other sources to run to meet your organizations requirements.

To get started with using this new policy type, see [Manage approved apps for Windows devices with Application Control policy and Managed Installers for Microsoft Intune](../protect/endpoint-security-app-control-policy.md)

#### Intune UI displays Windows Server devices as distinct from Windows clients for the Security Management for Microsoft Defender for Endpoint scenario<!-- 16882836 -->  
To support the [Security Management for Microsoft Defender for Endpoint](../protect/mde-security-integration.md) (MDE security configuration) scenario, Intune now differentiates Windows devices in Azure Active Directory as either *Windows Server* for devices that run Windows Server, or as *Windows* for devices that run Windows 10 or Windows 11.

With this change, you can improve policy targeting for MDE security configuration. For example, you can use dynamic groups that consist of only Windows Server devices, or only Windows client devices (Windows 10/11).

For more information about this change, see the Intune Customer Success blog [Windows Server devices now recognized as a new OS in Microsoft Intune, Azure AD, and Defender for Endpoint
](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/intune-customer-success/support-tip-windows-server-devices-will-now-be-identified-as-a/ba-p/3767773).

#### Group policy analytics supports scope tags<!-- 12714882  -->  
In Group Policy analytics, you import your on-premises GPO. The tool analyzes your GPOs and shows the settings that can (and can't) be used in Intune.

When you import your GPO XML file in Intune, you can select an existing scope tag. If you don't select a scope tag, then the **Default** scope tag is automatically selected. Previously, when you imported a GPO, the scope tags assigned to you were automatically applied to the GPO.

Only admins within that scope tag can see the imported policies. Admins not in that scope tag can't see the imported policies.

Also, admins within their scope tag can migrate the imported policies that they have permissions to see. To migrate an imported GPO into a Settings Catalog policy, a scope tag must be associated with the imported GPO. If a scope tag isn't associated, then it can't migrate to a Settings Catalog policy. If no scope tag is selected, then a default scope tag is automatically applied.

For more information on scope tags and Group Policy analytics, go to:

- [Analyze your on-premises GPOs using Group Policy analytics in Microsoft Intune](../configuration/group-policy-analytics.md)

You can view the list of settings in the new baseline at [Microsoft 365 Apps for Enterprise baseline settings (Office)](../protect/security-baseline-v2-office-settings.md).

The new Intune security baseline format aligns the presentation of settings that are available to the settings found in the Intune settings catalog. This alignment helps resolve past issues for setting names and implementations for settings that could create conflicts. The new format also improves the reporting experience for baselines in the Intune admin center.

The Microsoft 365 Office Apps baseline can help you rapidly deploy configurations to your Office Apps that meet the security recommendations of the Office and security teams at Microsoft. As with all baselines, the default baseline represents the recommended configurations. You can modify the default baseline to meet the requirements of your organization.

The new Intune security baseline format aligns the presentation of settings that are available to the settings found in the Intune settings catalog. This alignment helps resolve past issues for setting names and implementations for settings that could create conflicts. The new format also improves the reporting experience for baselines in the Intune admin center.

Now that the new baseline version is available, all new profiles you create for Microsoft Edge use the new baseline format and version. While the new version becomes the default baseline version, you can continue to use the profiles you've previously created for older versions of Microsoft Edge. But, you can't create new profiles for those older versions of Microsoft Edge.

### App management

#### Changes to iCloud app backup and restore behavior on iOS/iPadOS and macOS devices<!-- 16261392  -->  
As an app setting, you can select to **Prevent iCloud app backup** for iOS/iPadOS and macOS devices. You can *not* backup managed App Store apps and line-of-business (LOB) apps on iOS/iPadOS, as well as managed App Store apps on macOS devices (macOS LOB apps don't support this feature), for both user and device licensed VPP/non-VPP apps. This update includes both new and existing App Store/LOB apps sent with and without VPP that are being added to Intune and targeted to users and devices.

Preventing the backup of the specified managed apps ensures that these apps can be properly deployed via Intune when the device is enrolled and restored from backup. If the admin configures this new setting for new or existing apps in their tenant, then managed apps can and will be reinstalled for devices. But, Intune doesn't allow them to be backed up.

This new setting appears in [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431) by modifying the properties of an app. For an existing app, you can select **Apps** > **iOS/iPadOS** or **macOS** > *select the app* > **Properties** > Assignment **Edit**. If no group assignment has been set, select **Add group** to add a group. Modify either the setting under **VPN**, **Uninstall on device removal**, or **Install as removable**. Then, select **Prevent iCloud app backup**. The **Prevent iCloud app backup** setting is used to prevent backup of app data for the application. Set to **No** to allow the app to be backed up by iCloud.

For more information, see [Changes to applications' backup and restore behavior on iOS/iPadOS and macOS devices](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/intune-customer-success/changes-to-applications-backup-and-restore-behavior-on-ios/ba-p/3692064) and [Assign apps to groups with Microsoft Intune](../apps/apps-deploy.md).

#### Manage Windows LAPS with Intune policies (public preview)<!-- 11890571  -->  
Now available in a public preview, manage Windows Local Administrator Password Solution (Windows LAPS) with Microsoft Intune [Account protection policies](../protect/endpoint-security-account-protection-policy.md). To get started, see [Intune support for Windows LAPS](../protect/windows-laps-overview.md).

[Windows LAPS](/windows-server/identity/laps/laps-overview) is a Windows feature that allows you to manage and backs up the password of a local administrator account on your Azure Active Directory-joined or Windows Server Active Directory-joined devices.

To manage LAPS, Intune configures the Windows [LAPS configuration service provider](/windows/client-management/mdm/LAPS-csp) (CSP) that is built in to Windows devices. It takes precedence over other sources of Windows LAPS configurations, like GPOs or the Microsoft Legacy LAPS tool. Some of the capabilities you can use when Intune manages Windows LAPS include:

- Define password requirements like complexity and length that apply to the local administrator accounts on a device.
- Configure devices to rotate their local admin account passwords on a schedule. And, back up the account and password in your Azure Active Directory or on-premises Active Directory.
- Use an Intune device action from the admin center to manually rotate the password for an account on your own schedule.
- View account details from within the Intune admin center, like the account name and password. This information can help you recover devices that are otherwise inaccessible.
- Use Intune reports to monitor your LAPS policies, and when devices last rotated passwords manually or by schedule.  

Applies to:

- Windows 10
- Windows 11

#### New settings available for macOS software update policies<!-- 16646756  -->  
macOS software update policies now include the following settings to help manage when updates install on a device. These settings are available when the *All other updates* update type is configured to *Install later*:

- **Max User Deferrals**:  When the *All other updates* update type is configured to *Install later*, this setting allows you to specify the maximum number of times a user can postpone a minor OS update before it's installed. The system prompts the user once a day. Available for devices running macOS 12 and later.

- **Priority**: When the *All other updates* update type is configured to *Install later*, this setting allows you to specify values of *Low* or *High* for the scheduling priority for downloading and preparing minor OS updates. Available for devices running macOS 12.3 and later.

For more information, see [Use Microsoft Intune policies to manage macOS software updates](../protect/software-updates-macos.md).

Applies to:

- macOS

#### Introducing the new partner portals page<!-- 17829024  -->

The Microsoft Surface link takes you to the Surface Management Portal where you can get insights into device compliance, support activity, and warranty coverage.

To access the Partner portals page, you must enable the Devices pane preview and then navigate to **Devices** > **Partner Portals**.

#### Windows Update compatibility reports for Apps and Drivers are now generally available<!-- 17917026  -->  
The following Microsoft Intune reports for [Windows Update compatibility](../protect/windows-update-compatibility-reports.md) are out of preview and now generally available:

- **Windows feature update device readiness report** - This report provides per-device information about compatibility risks that are associated with an upgrade or update to a chosen version of Windows.

- **Windows feature update compatibility risks report** - This report provides a summary view of the top compatibility risks across your organization for a chosen version of Windows. You can use this report to understand which compatibility risks impact the greatest number of devices in your organization.

These reports can help you plan an upgrade from Windows 10 to 11, or for installing the latest Windows feature update.

### Device security

#### Microsoft Intune Endpoint Privilege Management is generally available<!--1564177  -->  
Microsoft Endpoint Privilege Management (EPM) is now generally available and no longer in preview.

With [Endpoint Privilege Management](../protect/epm-overview.md), admins can set policies that allow standard users to perform tasks normally reserved for an administrator. To do so, you configure policies for *automatic* and *user-confirmed* workflows that elevate the run-time permissions for apps or processes you select. You then assign these policies to users or devices that have end users running without Administrator privileges. After the device receives a policy, EPM brokers the elevation on behalf of the user, allowing them to elevate approved applications without needing full administrator privileges. EPM also includes built-in insights and reporting.

Now that EPM is out of preview, it requires another license to use. You can choose between a stand-alone license that adds only EPM, or license EPM as part of the Microsoft Intune Suite. For more information, see [Use Intune Suite add-on capabilities](../fundamentals/intune-add-ons.md).

While Endpoint Privilege Management is now generally available, the [reports for EPM](../protect/epm-reports.md) will transition to a feature in *preview*, and will receive some more enhancements before being removed from preview.

#### Support for WDAC Application ID tagging with Intune Firewall Rules policy<!-- 17224780  -->  
Intune's *Microsoft Defender Firewall Rules* profiles, which are available as part of [endpoint security Firewall policy](../protect/endpoint-security-firewall-policy.md), now include the Policy App ID setting. This setting is described in the [*MdmStore/FirewallRules/{FirewallRuleName}/PolicyAppId*](/windows/client-management/mdm/Firewall-csp?WT.mc_id=Portal-fx#mdmstorefirewallrulesfirewallrulenamepolicyappid) CSP and supports specifying a Windows Defender Application Control (WDAC) Application ID tag.

With this capability, you can scope your firewall rules to an application or a group of applications and rely on your WDAC policies to define those applications. By using tags to link to and rely on WDAC policies, your Firewall Rules policy won't need to rely on the firewall rules option of an absolute file path, or use of a variable file path that can reduce security of the rule.

Use of this capability requires you to have WDAC policies in place that include *AppId* tags that you can then specify in your Intune Microsoft Defender Firewall Rules.

For more information, see the following articles in the Windows Defender Application Control documentation:

- [About application control for Windows](/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-defender-application-control/windows-defender-application-control)
- [WDAC Application ID (AppId) Tagging guide](/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-defender-application-control/appidtagging/windows-defender-application-control-appid-tagging-guide)

Applies to:

- Windows 10/11

#### New App and browser isolation profile for Intune's endpoint security Attack Surface Reduction policy<!-- 17392386  -->  
We have released a new experience creating new *App and Browser Isolation* profiles for endpoint security Attack Surface Reduction policy. The experience for editing your previously created App and Browser isolation policies remains the same, and you can continue to use them. This update applies only for the new [App and Browser Isolation](../protect/endpoint-security-asr-policy.md#attack-surface-reduction-profiles) policies you create for the *Windows 10 and later* platform.

#### Microsoft Intune Endpoint Privilege Management (public preview)<!-- 15654169   -->  
As a public preview, you can now use Microsoft Intune Endpoint Privilege Management. With Endpoint Privilege Management, admins can set policies that allow standard users to perform tasks normally reserved for an administrator. Endpoint Privilege Management can be configured in the [Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431) at **Endpoint security** > **Endpoint Privilege Management**.

With the public preview, you can configure policies for *automatic* and *user-confirmed* workflows that elevate the run-time permissions for apps or processes you select. You then assign these policies to users or devices that have end users running without Administrator privileges. Once policy is received, Endpoint Privilege Management will broker the elevation on behalf of the user, allowing them to elevate approved applications without needing full administrator privileges. The preview also includes built-in insights and reporting for Endpoint Privilege Management.

To learn how to activate the public preview and use Endpoint Privilege Management policies, start with [Use Endpoint Privilege Management with Microsoft Intune](../protect/epm-overview.md). Endpoint Privilege Management is part of the [Intune Suite](../fundamentals/intune-add-ons.md) offering, and free to try while it remains in public preview.

### Monitor and troubleshoot

#### Diagnostic data collection for Endpoint Privilege Management<!-- 17392824   -->  
To support the release of Endpoint Privilege Management, we've updated [Collect diagnostics from a Windows device](../remote-actions/collect-diagnostics.md) to include the following data, which is collected from devices enabled for Endpoint Privilege Management:

- Registry keys:

  - HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\EPMAgent

- Commands:

  - %windir%\system32\pnputil.exe /enum-drivers

- Log files:

  - %ProgramFiles%\Microsoft EPM Agent\Logs\\\*.*
  - %windir%\system32\config\systemprofile\AppData\Local\mdm\\\*.log

#### View status for pending and failed organizational messages<!-- 17017707  -->  
We've added two more states to organizational message reporting details to make it easier to track pending and failed messages in the admin center.

- **Pending**: The message hasn't been scheduled yet and is currently in progress.
- **Failed**: The message failed to schedule due to a service error.

For information about reporting details, see [View reporting details for organizational messages](../remote-actions/organizational-messages-reporting.md).  


#### More reporting information related to tenant attach devices<!-- 9220597  -->  
You can now view information for tenant attach devices in the existing antivirus reports under the Endpoint Security workload. A new column differentiates between devices managed by Intune and devices managed by Configuration Manager. This reporting information is available in [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431) by selecting **Endpoint security** > **Antivirus**.

#### Meta Quest 2 and Quest Pro are now in Open Beta (US only) on Microsoft Intune for Android Open Source Devices  
Microsoft Intune for Android open source project devices (AOSP) has welcomed Meta Quest 2 and Quest Pro into Open Beta for the US market.

### App management

#### Trusted Root Certificates Management for Intune App SDK for Android<!-- 15135752 -->  
If your Android application requires SSL/TLS certificates issued by an on-premises or private certificate authority to provide secure access to internal websites and applications, the Intune App SDK for Android now has support for certificate trust management. For more information and examples, see [Trusted Root Certificates Management](../developer/app-sdk-android-phase7.md#trusted-root-certificates-management).

#### System context support for UWP apps<!-- 16544103 -->  
In addition to user context, you can deploy Universal Windows Platform (UWP) apps from the **Microsoft Store app (new)** in system context. If a provisioned *.appx* app is deployed in system context, the app auto-installs for each user that logs in. If an individual end user uninstalls the user context app, the app still shows as installed because it's still provisioned. In addition, the app must not already be installed for any users on the device. Our general recommendation is to not mix install contexts when deploying apps. Win32 apps from the **Microsoft Store app (new)** already support system context.

### App management

#### Deploy Win32 apps to device groups<!-- 7359954 -->  
You can now deploy Win32 apps with **Available** intent to device groups. For more information, see [Win32 app management in Microsoft Intune](../apps/apps-win32-app-management.md).

### Device management

#### New URL for Microsoft Intune admin center<!-- 17441426 -->  
The Microsoft Intune admin center has a new URL: [https://intune.microsoft.com](https://intune.microsoft.com). The previously used URL, [https://endpoint.microsoft.com](https://endpoint.microsoft.com), continues to work but will redirect to the new URL in late 2023. We recommend taking the following actions to avoid issues with Intune access and automated scripts:

* Update login or automation to point to `https://intune.microsoft.com`.
* Update your firewalls, as needed, to allow access to the new URL.
* Add the new URL to your favorites and bookmarks.
* Notify your helpdesk and update IT administrator documentation.

### Tenant administration

#### Add CMPivot queries to Favorites folder<!-- 16702226 -->
You can add your frequently used queries to a **Favorites** folder in CMPivot. CMPivot allows you to quickly assess the state of a device managed by Configuration Manager via Tenant Attach and take action. The functionality is similar to one already present in the Configuration Manager console. This addition helps you keep all your most used queries in one place. You can also add tags to your queries to help search and find queries. The queries saved in the Configuration Manager console aren't automatically added to your **Favorites** folder. You need to create new queries and add them to this folder. For more information about CMPivot, see [Tenant attach: CMPivot usage overview](../../configmgr/tenant-attach/cmpivot-start.md).

### Device enrollment

This update enables better support for the new Microsoft Store experience and should be rolling out to all tenants starting with Intune 2303. For related information, see [Set up the Enrollment Status Page](../enrollment/windows-enrollment-status.md).
