### Device security

#### Use the variable CN={{UserPrincipalName}} in the subject and SAN of SCEP and PKCS certificate profiles for Android Enterprise devices<!-- 9290978   -->
You can now use the User attribute **CN={{UserPrincipalName}}** variable in the subject or SAN of a [PKCS certificate profile](../protect/certificates-pfx-configure.md#create-a-trusted-certificate-profile) or [SCEP certificate profile](../protect/certificates-profile-scep.md#create-a-scep-certificate-profile) for Android devices. This support requires the device have a user, such as devices enrolled as:
- Android Enterprise fully managed
- Android Enterprise personally-owned work profile

User attributes are not supported for devices that donâ€™t have user associations, such as devices that are enrolled as Android Enterprise dedicated. For example, a profile that uses *CN={{UserPrincipalName}}* in the subject or SAN wonâ€™t be able to get the user principal name when there is no user on the device.

#### Use app protection policies for Defender for Endpoint on Android and iOS<!-- 6486982   7362746  -->
You can now use [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint in app protection policies for devices that run Android or iOS](../protect/advanced-threat-protection-configure.md#create-and-assign-app-protection-policy-to-set-device-risk-level).
- Configure your MAM conditional launch policy to include **Max allowed threat level** signals from Microsoft Defender for Endpoint on iOS devices and Android devices.
- Choose to **Block Access** or **Wipe Data** based on whether or not the device meets the expected threat level.

When configured, end users are prompted to install and set up the **Microsoft Defender for Endpoint** app from the applicable app store. As a prerequisite, you must set up your **Microsoft Defender for Endpoint** connector and switch on the toggle to send risk data to your app protection policies. For related information, see [App protection policies overview](../apps/app-protection-policy.md), and [Use Microsoft Defender for Endpoint in Microsoft Intune](..\protect\advanced-threat-protection.md).

#### Configure Attack surface reduction rules to block malware from gaining persistence through WMI<!-- 8902661   -->
You can now configure the rule named **Block persistence through WMI event subscription** as part of an [Attack surface reduction rules](../protect/endpoint-security-asr-policy.md#attack-surface-reduction-profiles) profile in Endpoint security.

This rule prevents malware from abusing WMI to attain persistence on a device. Fileless threats employ various tactics to stay hidden, to avoid being seen in the file system, and to gain periodic execution control. Some threats can abuse the WMI repository and event model to stay hidden.

When configured as [setting for *Attack surface reduction*](../protect/endpoint-security-asr-profile-settings.md#attack-surface-reduction-rules-profile) policy for Endpoint security, the following options are available:
- **Not configured** (default) â€“ The setting returns to the Windows default, which is off and persistence is not blocked.
- **Block** â€“ Persistence through WMI is blocked.
- **Audit** â€“ Evaluate how this rule affects your organization if its enabled (set to Block).
- **Disable** - Turn this rule off. Persistence is not blocked.

This rule doesnâ€™t support the *Warn* option, and is also available as a Device configuration setting from the [Settings catalog](../configuration/settings-catalog.md).

#### Use the settings catalog to configure Microsoft Edge browser on macOS devices - public preview <!-- 4552197   -->
Currently on macOS devices, you configure the Microsoft Edge browser using a .plist preference file (**Devices** > **Configuration profiles** > **Create profile** > **macOS** for platform > **Preference file** for profile).

There's an updated UI to configure the Microsoft Edge browser: **Devices** > **Configuration profiles** > **Create profile** > **macOS** for platform > **Settings catalog (preview)** for profile. Select the Microsoft Edge settings you want, and then configure them. In your profile, you can also add settings, or remove existing settings.

To see a list of the settings you can configure, go to [Microsoft Edge - Policies](/DeployEdge/microsoft-edge-policies). Be sure macOS is listed as a supported platform. If some settings aren't available in the settings catalog, then it's recommended to continue using the preference file only.

For more information, see:
- [Settings catalog](../configuration/settings-catalog.md)
- [Add a property list file to macOS devices using Intune](../configuration/preference-file-settings-macos.md)

To see the policies you have configured, open Microsoft Edge, and go to `edge://policy`.

Applies to:
- Microsoft Edge browser version 77 and newer on macOS

#### Home screen layout updates on supervised iOS/iPadOS devices<!-- 8710594 7978976    -->
On iOS/iPadOS devices, you can configure the Home Screen layout (**Devices** > **Device Configuration** > **Create profile** > **iOS/iPadOS** for platform > **Device features** for profile > **Home screen layout**). In Intune, the Home Screen Layout feature is updated:

- <!-- 8710594 --> The home screen layout has a new design. This feature allows admins to see in real time how the apps and app icons look on pages, the dock, and within folders. When adding apps in this new designer, you can't add separate pages. But, when you add nine or more apps to a folder, then those apps automatically go on the next page.
    Existing policies are not impacted, and don't need to be changed. The setting values are transferred to the new UI without any negative effects. The setting behavior on devices is the same.
- <!-- 7978976 --> Add a web link (web app) to a page, or to the dock. Be sure you add a specific URL of the web link only once. Existing policies are not impacted, and don't need to be changed.

For more information on the settings you can configure, including the home screen layout, see [iOS/iPadOS device settings to use common iOS/iPadOS features in Intune](../configuration/ios-device-features-settings.md).

#### Locale support in email notifications for non-compliance<!--7604191    -->
Compliance policies now support [Notification message templates](../protect/actions-for-noncompliance.md#create-a-notification-message-template) that include separate messages for different locales. Support for multiple languages no longer requires you to create separate templates and policies for each locale.

When you configure locale-specific messages in a template, non-compliant end-users receive the appropriate localized email notification message based on their O365 preferred language. You also designate one localized message in the template as the *default* message. The default message is sent to users that havenâ€™t set a preferred language or when the template doesnâ€™t include a specific message for their locale.

<!-- vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv -->
### Device enrollment

#### Hide more screens for the Apple Automated Device Enrollment Setup Assistant <!--7786092   -->

### Device security

#### Intune support for Microsoft Defender Application Guard now includes isolated Windows environments<!-- 8274282     -->
When you configure **Turn on Application Guard**  in an Intune [App and browser isolation profile](../protect/endpoint-security-asr-profile-settings.md#app-and-browser-isolation) in Endpoint security Attack surface reduction policy, you can choose from the following options when you enable Application Guard:

- **Microsoft Edge** - *Previously available*
- **Isolated Windows environments** - *New with this update*
- **Microsoft Edge** ***and*** **isolated Windows environments** - *New with this update*

Before this release, the setting was named *Turn on Application Guard for Edge (Options)*.

The new options for this setting expand Application Guard support beyond just URLâ€™s for Edge. You can now enable Application Guard to help protect devices by opening potential threats in a hardware isolated Windows VM environment (container). For example, with support for isolated Windows environments, Application Guard can open untrusted Office documents in an isolated Windows VM.

With this change:
- Intune now supports the full range of values found in the Windows MDM CSP: [AllowWindowsDefenderApplicationGuard](/windows/client-management/mdm/windowsdefenderapplicationguard-csp).
- To help you understand the affect on device users when using isolated Windows environments, see [Application Guard testing scenarios](/windows/security/threat-protection/microsoft-defender-application-guard/test-scenarios-md-app-guard) in the Windows security documentation.
- Read more about Application Guard and support for Office apps in [Application Guard for Office](/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/install-app-guard?view=o365-worldwide&preserve-view=true) in the Microsoft 365 documentation.

#### New Application Guard settings in Attack surface reduction policy<!-- 8274336   -->
Weâ€™ve added two new settings to the App and browser isolation profile of Intuneâ€™s [Endpoint security Attack surface reduction policy](../protect/endpoint-security-asr-policy.md):
- **Application Guard allow camera and microphone access** â€“ Manage access by Application Guard apps to a devices camera and microphone.
- **Application Guard allow use of Root Certificate Authorities from the user's device** â€“ When you specify one or more root certificate thumbprints, the matching certificates are transferred to the Microsoft Defender Application Guard container.

For more information, see the settings for [App and browser isolation](../protect/endpoint-security-asr-profile-settings.md#app-and-browser-isolation).


#### Updates for Security Baselines<!-- 8391335, 8377369   -->
We have new versions available for the following [security baselines](../protect/security-baselines.md):
- **[MDM Security baseline (Windows 10 Security)](../protect/security-baseline-settings-mdm-all.md?pivots=december-2020)**
- **[Microsoft Defender for Endpoint baseline](../protect/security-baseline-settings-defender-atp.md?pivots=december-2020)**

Updated baseline versions bring support for recent settings to help you maintain the best-practice configurations recommended by the respective product teams.

To understand what's changed between versions, see [Compare baseline versions](../protect/security-baselines.md#compare-baseline-versions) to learn how to export a .CSV file that shows the changes.

#### Endpoint Security Firewall reports<!-- 5653366    -->
Weâ€™ve added two new reports that are dedicated to Firewall policies in Endpoint Security:
- [Windows 10 MDM devices with firewall off](../protect/endpoint-security-policy.md) is found in the Endpoint security node and displays the list of Windows 10 devices with the Firewall turned off. This report identifies each device by device name, device ID, user information, and the Firewall status.
- [Windows 10 MDM Firewall status](../fundamentals/reports.md#windows-10-mdm-firewall-status-organizational) is an organizational report found in the *Reports* node, which lists the firewall status for your Windows 10 devices. This report displays status information that includes if the firewall is enabled, disabled, limited, or temporarily disabled.

#### Summary view for Defender Antivirus reports<!-- 8846877   -->
Weâ€™ve updated the view for the Microsoft Defender Antivirus reports found in the **Reports** node of the Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center. Now, when you select Microsoft Defender Antivirus in the **Reports** node, youâ€™ll see the default view of the **Summary** tab, and a second tab for **Reports**. The **Reports** tab is where youâ€™ll find the previously available [Antivirus agent status](../fundamentals/reports.md#antivirus-agent-status-report-organizational) and [Detected malware](../fundamentals/reports.md#detected-malware-report-organizational) organizational reports.

The new **Summary** tab displays the following information:
- Displays aggregate details for the Antivirus reports.
- Includes a *Refresh* option that updates the counts of devices in each antivirus state.
- Reflects the same data as found in the [Antivirus agent status organizational](../fundamentals/reports.md#antivirus-agent-status-report-organizational) report, which is now accessed from the **Reports** tab.

#### App protection policy support on Android and iOS/iPadOS for additional Mobile Threat Defense partners<!-- 8846351  -->
In October of 2019, Intune app protection policy added the capability to use data from our Microsoft Threat Defense partners.

With this update, we're expanding this support to the following partner for using an app protection policy to block or selectively wipe a userâ€™s corporate data based on the health of the device:
- **McAfee MVision Mobile** on Android, iOS and iPadOS

For more information, see [Create Mobile Threat Defense app protection policy with Intune](../protect/mtd-app-protection-policy.md).

#### Increased certificate validity period for SCEP and PKCS profiles<!-- 8629805   -->
Intune now supports a **Certificate validity period** of up to **24** months in certificate profiles for [Simple Certificate Enrollment Protocol](../protect/certificates-profile-scep.md#create-a-scep-certificate-profile) (SCEP) and [Public Key Cryptography Standards](../protect/certificates-pfx-configure.md#create-a-pkcs-certificate-profile) (PKCS). This is an increase from the previous support period of up to 12 months.

This support applies to Windows and Android. Certificate validity periods are ignored by iOS/iPadOS and macOS.

We've updated the app icon for the Company Portal for iOS, macOS, and web. This icon is also used by the Company Portal for Windows. End users will see the new icon in their device's application launcher and home screen, in Apple's App Store, and in experiences within the Company Portal apps.

#### Android Enterprise system app support in personally-owned work profiles<!-- 5291507 -->
You can now deploy Android Enterprise system apps to Android Enterprise personally-owned work profile devices. System apps are apps that do not appear in the Managed Google Play Store and often come pre-installed on the device. Once a system app is deployed, you will be unable to uninstall, hide, or otherwise remove the system app. For related information about system apps, see [Add Android Enterprise system apps to Microsoft Intune](../apps/apps-ae-system.md).


<!-- vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv -->
### Monitor and troubleshoot

#### Update when exporting Intune reports using the Graph API<!-- 8764428 -->
When you use the `exportJobs` Graph API to export Intune reports without selecting any columns for the devices report, you will receive the default column set. To reduce confusion, we have removed columns from the default column set. The removed columns are `PhoneNumberE164Format`, `_ComputedComplianceState`, `_OS`, and `OSDescription`. These columns are still available for selection if you need them, but only explicitly, and not by default. If you have built automation around the default columns of the device export, and that automation uses any of these columns, you need to refactor your processes to explicitly select these and any other relevant columns. For related information, see [Export Intune reports using Graph APIs](../fundamentals/reports-export-graph-apis.md).
