### Device security

#### Updated security baseline for Windows version 24H2<!-- 29819143 -->

You can now deploy the Intune security baseline for **Windows version 24H2** to your Windows 10 and Windows 11 devices. The new baseline version uses the unified settings platform seen in the Settings Catalog, which features an improved user interface and reporting experience, consistency and accuracy improvements with setting tattooing, and the new ability to support assignment filters for profiles.

Use of [Intune security baselines](../protect/security-baselines.md) can help you maintain best-practice configurations for your Windows devices and can help you rapidly deploy configurations to your Windows devices that meet the security recommendations of the applicable security teams at Microsoft.

As with all baselines, the default baseline represents the recommended configurations for each setting, which you can modify to meet the requirements of your organization.

Applies to:

- Windows

### Monitor and troubleshoot

#### Device Query for Multiple Devices<!--25234456 -->

We've added Device query for multiple devices. This feature allows you to gain comprehensive insights about your entire fleet of devices using Kusto Query Language (KQL) to query across collected inventory data for your devices.

### Microsoft Intune Suite
 
#### Use Microsoft Security Copilot with Endpoint Privilege Manager to help identify potential elevation risks<!-- 27265509 -->

When your Azure Tenant is licensed for Microsoft Security Copilot, you can now use Security Copilot to help you investigate Endpoint Privilege Manager (EPM) file elevation requests from within the EPM [support approved](../protect/epm-support-approved.md#use-microsoft-security-copilot-to-analyze-file-elevation-requests) work flow.

With this capability, while reviewing the properties of a file elevation request, you'll now find option to **Analyze with Copilot**. Use of this option directs Security Copilot to use the files hash in a prompt Microsoft Defender Threat Intelligence to evaluate the file potential indicators of compromise so you can then make a more informed decision to either approve or deny that file elevation request. Some of the results that are returned to your current view in the admin center include:

- The files’ reputation
- Information about the trust of the publisher
- The risk score for the user requesting the file elevation
- The risk score of the device from which the elevation was submitted

EPM is available as an [Intune Suite add-on-capability](../fundamentals/intune-add-ons.md). To learn more about how you can currently use Copilot in Intune, see [Microsoft Copilot in Intune](../copilot/copilot-intune-overview.md).

> [!NOTE]
>
> *Rollout of this feature is delayed and now expected to be available in May 2025.*

You can now manage the Microsoft Defender for Endpoint CSP setting for [tamper protection](/windows/client-management/mdm/defender-csp) on unenrolled devices you manage as part of the [Defender for Endpoint security settings management](../protect/mde-security-integration.md#which-solution-should-i-use) scenario.
 
With this support, tamper protection configurations from *Windows Security Experience* profiles for *Antivirus* policies now apply to all devices instead of only to those that are enrolled with Intune.

### Device configuration

#### Ending support for administrative templates when creating a new configuration profile<!-- 29989512 -->

Customers cannot create new Administrative Templates configuration profile through **Devices > Configuration > Create > New policy > Windows 10 and later > Administrative Templates**. A (retired) tag is seen next to **Administrative Templates** and the **Create** button is now greyed out. Other templates will continue to be supported.

However, customers can now use the Settings Catalog for creating new **Administrative Templates** configuration profile by navigating to **Devices > Configuration > Create > New policy > Windows 10 and later > Settings Catalog**.

There are no changes in the following UI experiences: 

- Editing an existing Administrative template.
- Deleting an existing Administrative template.
- Adding, modifying, or deleting settings in an existing Administrative template.
- **Imported Administrative templates (Preview)** template, which is used for Custom ADMX.

For more information, see [Use ADMX templates on Windows 10/11 devices in Microsoft Intune](..\configuration\administrative-templates-windows.md).

Applies to:

## Week of December 2, 2024

### Device enrollment

#### Change to enrollment behavior for iOS enrollment profile type<!-- 29068674 -->

At Apple WWDC 2024, Apple ended support for profile-based Apple user enrollment. For more information, see [Support has ended for profile-based user enrollment with Company Portal](#support-has-ended-for-apple-profile-based-user-enrollment-with-company-portal). As a result of this change, we updated the behavior that occurs when you select **Determine based on user choice** as the enrollment profile type for bring-your-own-device (BYOD) enrollments.

Now when users select **I own this device** during a BYOD enrollment, Microsoft Intune enrolls them via account-driven user enrollment, rather than profile-based user enrollment, and then secures only work-related apps. Less than one percent of Apple devices across all Intune tenants are currently enrolled this way, so this change doesn't affect most enrolled devices. There is no change for iOS users who select **My company owns this device** during a BYOD enrollment. Intune enrolls them via device enrollment with Intune Company Portal, and then secures their entire device.

If you currently allow users in BYOD scenarios to determine their enrollment profile type, you must take action to ensure account-driven user enrollment works by completing all prerequisites. For more information, see [Set up account driven Apple user enrollment](../enrollment/apple-account-driven-user-enrollment.md). If you don't give users the option to choose their enrollment profile type, there are no action items.

### Device management

#### Device Inventory for Windows<!-- 24853010 -->

Device inventory lets you collect and view additional hardware properties from your managed devices to help you better understand the state of your devices and make business decisions.

## Week of October 7, 2024

### App management

#### New UI for Intune Company Portal app for Windows<!-- 27219294 -->

The UI for the Intune Company Portal app for Windows is updated. Users now see an improved experience for their desktop app without changing the functionality they've used in the past. Specific UI improvements are focused on the **Home**, **Devices**, and **Downloads & updates** pages. The new design is more intuitive and highlights areas where users need to take action.

For more information, see [New look for Intune Company Portal app for Windows](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/intune-customer-success/new-look-for-intune-company-portal-app-for-windows/ba-p/4158755). For end user details, see [Install and share apps on your device](../user-help/install-apps-cpapp-windows.md).

### Device security

#### New strong mapping requirements for SCEP certificates authenticating with KDC<!-- 29005591 -->

The Key Distribution Center (KDC) requires user or device objects to be strongly mapped to Active Directory for certificate-based authentication. This means that a Simple Certificate Enrollment Protocol (SCEP) certificate's subject alternative name (SAN) must have a security identifier (SID) extension that maps to the user or device SID in Active Directory. The mapping requirement protects against certificate spoofing and ensures that certificate-based authentication against the KDC continues working.

To meet requirements, modify or create a SCEP certificate profile in Microsoft Intune. Then add a `URI` attribute and the `OnPremisesSecurityIdentifier` variable to the SAN. After you do that, Microsoft Intune appends a tag with the SID extension to the SAN and issues new certificates to targeted users and devices. If the user or device has a SID on premises that's synced to Microsoft Entra ID, the certificate shows the SID. If they don't have a SID, a new certificate is issued without the SID.

For more information and steps, see [Update certificate connector: Strong mapping requirements for KB5014754](../protect/certificates-profile-scep.md).

Applies to:

- Windows 10/11, iOS/iPadOS, and macOS user certificates
- Windows 10/11 device certificates

This requirement isn't applicable to device certificates used with Microsoft Entra joined users or devices, because the SID attribute is an on-premises identifier.

#### Defender for Endpoint security settings support in government cloud environments (public preview)<!-- 24191406 -->

In public preview, customer tenants in US Government Community (GCC) High, and Department of Defense (DoD) environments can now use Intune to manage the Defender security settings on the devices that onboarded to Defender without enrolling those devices with Intune. This capability is known as [Defender for Endpoint security settings management](../protect/mde-security-integration.md).

For more information about the Intune features supported in GCC High and DoD environments, see [Intune US Government service description](../fundamentals/intune-govt-service-description.md).

## Week of September 30, 2024

### Device security

#### Updates to PKCS certificate issuance process in Microsoft Intune Certificate Connector, version 6.2406.0.1001 <!-- 24186560 -->

We updated the process for Public Key Cryptography Standards (PKCS) certificate issuance in Microsoft Intune to support the security identifiers (SID) information requirements described in [KB5014754](https://support.microsoft.com/topic/kb5014754-certificate-based-authentication-changes-on-windows-domain-controllers-ad2c23b0-15d8-4340-a468-4d4f3b188f16). As part of this update, an OID attribute containing the user or device SID is added to the certificate. This change is available with the Certificate Connector for Microsoft Intune, version 6.2406.0.1001, and applies to users and devices synced from Active Directory on-premises to Microsoft Entra ID.

The SID update is available for user certificates across all platforms, and for device certificates specifically on Microsoft Entra hybrid joined Windows devices.

For more information, see:

- [What's new for the certificate connector](../protect/certificate-connector-overview.md#september-19-2024)

- [Apply PFX changes to certificate](../protect/certificates-pfx-configure.md)

## Week of September 23, 2024 (Service release 2409)

### App management

#### Working Time settings for app protection policies<!-- 14631539 -->

Working time settings allow you to enforce policies that limit access to apps and mute message notifications received from apps during non-working time. The limit access setting is now available for the Microsoft Teams and Microsoft Edge apps. You can limit access by using App Protection Policies (APP) to block or warn end users from using the iOS/iPadOS or Android Teams and Microsoft Edge apps during non-working time by setting the **Non-working time** conditional launch setting. Also, you can create a non-working time policy to mute notifications from the Teams app to end users during non-working time.

For more information, see:

- [Android app protection policy settings](../apps/app-protection-policy-settings-android.md#conditional-launch)
- [iOS app protection policy settings](../apps/app-protection-policy-settings-ios.md#conditional-launch)

Applies to:

- Android
- iOS/iPadOS

#### Streamlined app creation experience for apps from Enterprise App Catalog<!-- 29411991 -->

We've streamlined the way apps from [Enterprise App Catalog](../apps/apps-add-enterprise-app.md) are added to Intune. We now provide a direct app link rather than duplicating the app binaries and metadata. App contents now download from a `*.manage.microsoft.com` subdomain. This update helps to improve the latency when adding an app to Intune. When you add an app from Enterprise App Catalog, it syncs immediately and is ready for additional action from within Intune.

#### Update Enterprise App Catalog apps<!-- 24875279 -->

Enterprise App Management is enhanced to allow you to update an **Enterprise App Catalog** app. This capability guides you through a wizard that allows you to add a new application and use supersedence to update the previous application.

For more information, see [Guided update supersedence for Enterprise App Management](../apps/apps-eam-supersedence.md).

### Device configuration

#### Samsung ended support for multiple Android device administrator (DA) settings <!-- 24990472 -->

On Android device administrator managed (DA) devices, Samsung has deprecated many [Samsung Knox APIs](https://docs.samsungknox.com/dev/knox-sdk/api-reference/deprecated-api-methods/) (opens Samsung's web site) configuration settings.

#### Extended expiration date for corporate-owned, user-associated AOSP enrollment tokens<!-- 25782149 -->

Now when you create an enrollment token for Android Open Source Project (AOSP) corporate-owned, user-associated devices, you can select an expiration date that's up to 65 years into the future, an improvement over the previous 90 day expiration date. You can also modify the expiration date of existing enrollment tokens for Android Open Source Project (AOSP) corporate-owned, user-associated devices.

### Device security

#### New disk encryption template for Personal Data Encryption<!-- 28677934 -->

You can now use the new *Personal Data Encryption* (PDE) template that is available through endpoint security [*disk encryption* policy](../protect/encrypt-devices.md). This new template configures the Windows [PDE configuration service provider](/windows/client-management/mdm/personaldataencryption-csp) (CSP), which was introduced in Windows 11 22H2. The PDE CSP is also available through the settings catalog.

PDE differs from BitLocker in that it encrypts files instead of whole volumes and disks. PDE occurs in addition to other encryption methods such as BitLocker. Unlike BitLocker that releases data encryption keys at boot, PDE doesn't release data encryption keys until a user signs in using Windows Hello for Business.

Applies to:

- Windows 11 version 22h2 or later

For more information about PDE, including prerequisites, related requirements, and recommendations, see the following articles in the Windows security documentation:

- [PDE overview](/windows/security/operating-system-security/data-protection/personal-data-encryption/)

### App management

#### Managed Home Screen user experience update<!-- 28232751 -->

All Android devices automatically migrate to the updated Managed Home Screen (MHS) user experience. For more information, see [Updates to the Managed Home Screen experience](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/intune-customer-success/updates-to-the-managed-home-screen-experience/bc-p/3997842).

### Device enrollment

#### Support has ended for Apple profile-based user enrollment with Company Portal<!-- 28361917 -->

Apple supports two types of manual enrollment methods for users and devices in bring-your-own-device (BYOD) scenarios: *profile-based enrollment* and *account-driven enrollment*. Apple ended support for profile-based user enrollment, known in Intune as *user enrollment with Company Portal*. This method was their privacy-focused BYOD enrollment flow that used managed Apple IDs. As a result of this change, Intune has ended support for [profile-based user enrollment with Company Portal](../enrollment/apple-user-enrollment-with-company-portal.md). Users can no longer enroll devices targeted with this enrollment profile type. This change doesn't affect devices that are already enrolled with this profile type, so you can continue to manage them in the admin center and receive Microsoft Intune technical support. Less than 1% of Apple devices across all Intune tenants are currently enrolled this way, so this change doesn't affect most enrolled devices.

There's no change to profile-based device enrollment with Company Portal, the default enrollment method for BYOD scenarios. Devices enrolled via Apple automated device enrollment also remain unaffected.

We recommend account-driven user enrollment as a replacement method for devices. For more information about your BYOD enrollment options in Intune, see:

- [Account-driven user enrollment](../enrollment/apple-account-driven-user-enrollment.md)
- [Web-based device enrollment](../enrollment/web-based-device-enrollment-ios.md)
- [Device enrollment with Company Portal](../enrollment/ios-device-enrollment.md#app-or-web-based-enrollment) (default enrollment method for BYOD scenarios)

For more information about the device enrollment types supported by Apple, see [Intro to Apple device enrollment types](https://support.apple.com/en-mide/guide/deployment/dep08f54fcf6/web) in the Apple Platform Deployment guide.

### Device management

#### Intune now supports iOS/iPadOS 16.x as the minimum version<!-- 28391935 -->

Later this year, we expect iOS 18 and iPadOS 18 to be released by Apple. Microsoft Intune, including the Intune Company Portal and Intune app protection policies (APP, also known as MAM), will require iOS/iPadOS 16 and higher shortly after the iOS/iPadOS 18 release.

For more information on this change, see [Plan for change: Intune is moving to support iOS/iPadOS 16 and later](whats-new.md#plan-for-change-intune-is-moving-to-support-iosipados-16-and-later).

> [!NOTE]
> Userless iOS and iPadOS devices enrolled through Automated Device Enrollment (ADE) have a slightly nuanced support statement due to their shared usage. For more information, see [Support statement for supported versus allowed iOS/iPadOS versions for user-less devices](https://aka.ms/ADE_userless_support).

Applies to:

- iOS/iPadOS

#### Intune now supports macOS 13.x as the minimum version<!-- 28391869 -->

With Apple's release of macOS 15 Sequoia, Microsoft Intune, the Company Portal app, and the Intune MDM agent will now require macOS 13 (Ventura) and later.

For more information on this change, see [Plan for change: Intune is moving to support macOS 13 and later](whats-new.md#plan-for-change-intune-is-moving-to-support-macos-13-and-higher-later-this-year)

## Week of August 19, 2024 (Service release 2408)

### Microsoft Intune Suite

#### Easy creation of Endpoint Privilege Management elevation rules from support approval requests and reports<!-- 28196775 -->

You can now create Endpoint Privilege Management (EPM) elevation rules directly from a support approved elevation request or from details found in the EPM Elevation report. With this new capability, you won’t need to manually identify specific file detection details for elevation rules. Instead, for files that appear in the Elevation report or a support approved elevation request, you can select that file to open its elevation detail pane, and then select the option to **Create a rule with these file details**.

When you use this option, you can then choose to add the new rule to one of your existing elevation policies, or create a new policy with only the new rule.

Applies to:

- Windows 10
- Windows 11

For information about this new capability, see [Windows elevation rules policy](../protect/epm-policies.md) in the *Configure policies for Endpoint Privilege management* article.

#### Introducing the Resource performance report for physical devices in Advanced Analytics<!-- 12659827 -->

#### Updates to the Discovered Apps report<!-- 28898418 -->

The **Discovered Apps** report, which provides a list of detected apps that are on Intune enrolled devices for your tenant, now provides publisher data for Win32 apps, in addition to Store apps. Rather than providing publisher information only in the exported report data, we're including it as a column in the **Discovered Apps** report.

For more information, see [Intune Discovered apps](../apps/app-discovered-apps.md#monitor-discovered-apps-with-intune).

#### Improvements to Intune Management Extension logs<!-- 26113668 -->

We have updated how log activities and events are made for Win32 apps and the Intune Management Extension (IME) logs. A new log file (*AppWorkload.log*) contains all logging information related to app deployment activities conducted by the IME. These improvements provide better troubleshooting and analysis of app management events on the client.

For more information, see [Intune management extension logs](../apps/intune-management-extension.md#intune-management-extension-logs).

#### Enhancements to multi administrative approval<!-- 25174473 -->

Multi administrative approval adds the ability to limit application access policies to Windows applications or all non-Windows applications or both. We're adding a new access policy to the multiple administrative approval feature to allow approvals for changes to multiple administrative approval.

For more information, see [Multi admin approval](../fundamentals/multi-admin-approval.md).

### Device enrollment

#### Account-driven Apple User Enrollment now generally available for iOS/iPadOS 15+<!-- 10277062 -->

Intune now supports account-driven Apple User Enrollment, the new, and improved version of Apple User Enrollment, for devices running iOS/iPadOS 15 and later. This new enrollment method utilizes just-in-time registration, removing the Company Portal app for iOS as an enrollment requirement. Device users can initiate enrollment directly in the Settings app, resulting in a shorter and more efficient onboarding experience.

For more information, see [Set up account driven Apple User Enrollment](../enrollment/apple-account-driven-user-enrollment.md) on Microsoft Learn.

Apple announced they are ending support for profile-based Apple User Enrollment. As a result, Microsoft Intune will end support for Apple User Enrollment with Company Portal shortly after the release of iOS/iPadOS 18. We recommend enrolling devices with account-driven Apple User Enrollment for similar functionality and an improved user experience.

#### Use corporate Microsoft Entra account to enable Android Enterprise management options in Intune<!-- 25231452 -->

Managing Intune-enrolled devices with Android Enterprise management options previously required you to connect your Intune tenant to your managed Google Play account using an enterprise Gmail account. Now you can use a corporate Microsoft Entra account to establish the connection. This change is happening in new tenants, and doesn't affect tenants that have already established a connection.

For more information, see [Connect Intune account to Managed Google Play account - Microsoft Intune | Microsoft Learn](../enrollment/connect-intune-android-enterprise.md).

### Device management

#### 21Vianet support for Mobile Threat Defense connectors<!-- 10355489 -->

Intune operated by 21Vianet now supports Mobile Threat Defense (MTD) connectors for Android and iOS/iPadOS devices for MTD vendors that also have support in that environment. When an MTD partner is supported and you sign in to a 21Vianet tenant, the supported connectors are available.

Applies to:

- Android
- iOS/iPadOS

For more information, see:

- [Intune operated by 21Vianet in China](../fundamentals/china.md)

### Device security

#### Windows platform name change for endpoint security policies<!-- 16104088 -->

When you create an endpoint security policy in Intune, you can select the Windows platform. For multiple templates in endpoint security, there are now only two options to choose for the Windows platform: **Windows** and **Windows (ConfigMgr)**.

Specifically, the platform name changes are:

| Original | New |
| --- | --- |
| Windows 10 and later​ | Windows |
| Windows 10 and later (ConfigMgr)​ | Windows (ConfigMgr)​ |
| Windows 10, Windows 11, and Windows Server | Windows |
| Windows 10, Windows 11, and Windows Server​ (ConfigMgr) | Windows (ConfigMgr)​ |

These changes apply to the following policies:

- Antivirus
- Disk encryption
- Firewall
- Endpoint Privilege Management
- Endpoint detection and response
- Attack surface reduction
- Account protection

##### What you need to know

- This change is only in the user experience (UX) that admins see when they create a new policy. There is no effect on devices.
- The functionally is the same as the previous platform names.
- There are no additional tasks or actions for existing policies.

For more information on endpoint security features in Intune, see [Manage endpoint security in Microsoft Intune](../protect/endpoint-security.md).

Applies to:

- Windows

#### Target Date Time setting for Apple software update enforcement schedules updates using the local time on devices <!-- 28865232 -->

You can specify the time that OS updates are enforced on devices in their local time zone. For example, configuring an OS update to be enforced at 5pm schedules the update for 5pm in the device's local time zone. Previously, this setting used the time zone of the browser where the policy was configured.

This change only applies to new policies that are created in the August 2408 release and later. The **Target Date Time** setting is in the [settings catalog](../configuration/settings-catalog.md) at **Devices** > **Manage devices** > **Configuration** > **Create** > **New policy** > **iOS/iPadOS** or **macOS** for platform > **Settings catalog** for profile type > **Declarative Device Management** > Software Update.

In a future release, the **UTC** text will be removed from the **Target Date Time** setting.

For more information on using the settings catalog to configure software updates, see [Managed software updates with the settings catalog](../protect/managed-software-updates-ios-macos.md).

Applies to:

- iOS/iPadOS

## Week of July 29, 2024

### Microsoft Intune Suite

#### Endpoint Privilege Management, Advanced Analytics, and Intune Plan 2 are available for GCC High and DoD<!-- 25230811, 25300700, 27030977, 27234960 -->

We are excited to announce that the following capabilities from the Microsoft Intune Suite are now supported in U.S. Government Community Cloud (GCC) High and U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) environments.

Add-on capabilities:

- [Endpoint Privilege Management](../protect/epm-overview.md)
- [Advanced Analytics](../../analytics/advanced-endpoint-analytics.md) - With this release, GCC High and DoD support for Advanced Endpoint Analytics doesn't include the [*Device query*](../../analytics/device-query.md) functionality.

Plan 2 capabilities:

- [Microsoft Tunnel for Mobile Application Management](../protect/microsoft-tunnel-mam.md)
- [Firmware-over-the-air update](../protect/zebra-lifeguard-ota-integration.md)

For more information, see:

- [Use Microsoft Intune Suite add-on capabilities](../fundamentals/intune-add-ons.md)
- [Microsoft Intune for US Government GCC service description](../fundamentals/intune-govt-service-description.md)

### Device enrollment

#### ACME protocol support for iOS/iPadOS and macOS enrollment<!-- 25140355 -->

As we prepare to support managed device attestation in Intune, we are starting a phased rollout of an infrastructure change for new enrollments that includes support for the *Automated Certificate Management Environment (ACME) protocol*. Now when new Apple devices enroll, the management profile from Intune receives an ACME certificate instead of a SCEP certificate. ACME provides better protection than SCEP against unauthorized certificate issuance through robust validation mechanisms and automated processes, which helps reduce errors in certificate management.

Existing OS and hardware eligible devices do not get the ACME certificate unless they re-enroll. There is no change to the end user's enrollment experience, and no changes to the Microsoft Intune admin center. This change only impacts enrollment certificates and has no impact on any device configuration policies.

ACME is supported for Apple Device Enrollment, Apple Configurator enrollment, and Automated device enrollment (ADE) methods. Eligible OS versions include:

- iOS 16.0 or later
- iPadOS 16.1 or later
- macOS 13.1 or later

This capability is also supported in [GCC High tenants](../fundamentals/intune-govt-service-description.md).
