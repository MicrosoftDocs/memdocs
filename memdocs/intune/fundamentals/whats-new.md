The variables included in the template, such as `{{username}}` and `{{devicename}}`, are replaced by the actual username or device name in the email that users receive. Variables are supported with all platforms. For more information and a list of supported variables, see [Create a notification message template](../protect/actions-for-noncompliance.md#create-a-notification-message-template).


#### Updated report visualization for Microsoft Defender for Endpoint connector<!--  24762035  -->  
We updated the reporting visualization for the Microsoft Defender for Endpoint connector. This [report visualization](../protect/advanced-threat-protection-configure.md#view-the-count-of-devices-that-are-onboarded-to-microsoft-defender-for-endpoint) displays the count of devices that have onboarded to Defender for Endpoint based on status from the Defender CSP, and visually aligns to other recent report views that use a bar to represent the percentage of devices with different status values.

### Device security

#### New settings for scheduling Antivirus scans added to Antivirus policy for Windows devices<!-- 26013546  -->  
We’ve added two settings to the *Microsoft Defender Antivirus* profile for  [endpoint security Antivirus policy](../protect/endpoint-security-antivirus-policy.md#antivirus-profiles) that applies to Windows 10 and Windows 11 devices.  These two settings work together to first enable support for a random start time of a device's antivirus scan, and to then define a range of time during which the randomized scan start can begin. These settings are supported with devices managed by Intune and devices managed through the [Defender for Endpoint security settings management](../protect/mde-security-integration.md) scenario.

- [**RandomizeScheduleTaskTimes**](/windows/client-management/mdm/policy-csp-admx-microsoftdefenderantivirus?WT.mc_id=Portal-fx#admx-microsoftdefenderantivirus-randomizescheduletasktimes) – This setting enables randomization of the scan start time on devices.
- [**SchedulerRandomizationTime**](/windows/client-management/mdm/defender-csp?WT.mc_id=Portal-fx#configurationschedulerrandomizationtime) – This setting, you can set boundaries for the random start time.

In addition to being added to the Microsoft Defender Antivirus profile, both settings are now available from the [settings catalog](../configuration/settings-catalog.md).

Applies to:

- Windows 10, 11

#### Microsoft Tunnel support for direct proxy exclusion list in VPN profiles for Android Enterprise<!-- 24139621 -->

With an exclusion list, you can exclude specific domains from your proxy setup without requiring the use of a Proxy Auto-Configuration (PAC) file. The proxy exclusion list is available with both Microsoft Tunnel and Microsoft Tunnel for MAM

The proxy exclusion list is supported in environments that use a single proxy. The exclusion list isn’t suitable or supported when you use multiple proxy servers, for which you should continue to use a .PAC file.

Applies to:

- Android Enterprise

#### Microsoft Tunnel server health metric to report on TLS certificate  revocation<!-- 25853648  -->  
We’ve added a new health metric for Microsoft Tunnel named **TLS certificate revocation**. This new health metric reports on the status of the Tunnel Servers TLS certificate by accessing the Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) or CRL address as defined in the TLS certificate. You can view the status of this new check with all the health checks in the Microsoft Intune admin center by navigating to **Tenant administration** > **Microsoft Tunnel Gateway** > **Health status**, selecting a server, and then selecting that servers **Health check** tab.

This metric runs as part of the existing Tunnel Health checks, and supports the following status:

- *Healthy*: The TLs certificate is not revoked
- *Warning*: Unable to check if the TLS certificate is revoked
- *Unhealthy*: The TLS certificate is revoked, and should be updated

For details about the TLS certificate revocation check, see [Monitor Microsoft Tunnel](../protect/microsoft-tunnel-monitor.md).

#### Additional settings for the Linux Antivirus policy template<!-- 24191424 -->  
We’ve expanded support for Linux by adding the following settings to the *Microsoft Defender Antivirus* template for Linux devices:

- cloudblocklevel
- scanarhives
- scanafterdefinitionupdate
- maximumondemandscanthreads
- behaviormonitoring
- enablefilehashcomputation
- networkprotection
- enforcementlevel
- nonexecmountpolicy

The Microsoft Defender Antivirus template for Linux is supported for devices [managed by Intune](../protect/endpoint-security-antivirus-policy.md), as well as those managed only by Defender through the [Defender for Endpoint security settings management](../protect/mde-security-integration.md) scenario.

#### Updated security baseline for Microsoft 365 Apps for Enterprise<!-- 25021846   -->  
We've released a new version of the Intune security baseline for **Microsoft 365 Apps for Enterprise**, version [**2306**](../protect/security-baselines.md#available-security-baselines).

The Microsoft 365 Office Apps baseline can help you rapidly deploy configurations to your Office Apps that meet the security recommendations of the Office and security teams at Microsoft. As with all baselines, the default baseline represents the recommended configurations. You can modify the default baseline to meet the requirements of your organization.

We’ve also updated our [reference article](../protect/security-baseline-v2-office-settings.md?pivots=v2306) for this baseline where you can view the default configuration of the settings this baseline version includes.

#### Deprecation and replacement of two  settings found in the Linux and macOS endpoint security Antivirus policies<!-- 25234740  -->  
We have deprecated two settings that are found in the *Antivirus engine* category of [Microsoft Defender Antivirus](../protect/endpoint-security-antivirus-policy.md) profiles of both macOS and Linux. These profiles are available as part of  Intune’s endpoint security Antivirus policies.

For each platform, the two deprecated settings are replaced by a single new setting that aligns to how the device configurations are managed by Microsoft Defender for Endpoint.

The following are the two deprecated settings:

- *Enable real-time protection* now appears as *Enable real-time protection (deprecated)*
- *Enable passive mode* now appears as *Enable passive mode (deprecated)*

The new setting that replaces the two deprecated settings:

- *Enforcement level* - By default, Enforcement level is set to *Passive* and supports options of *Real time* and *On demand*.

These settings are also available from the Intune [settings catalog](../configuration/settings-catalog.md) for each platform, where the old settings are also marked as deprecated and replaced by the new setting.

With this change, a device that has either of the *deprecated* settings configured will continue to apply that configuration until the device is targeted by the new setting *Enforcement level*. Once targeted by Enforcement Level, the deprecated settings no longer are applied to the device.

The *deprecated* settings will be removed from the Antivirus profiles and the settings catalog in a future update to Intune.

> [!NOTE]
> The changes for Linux are now available. The macOS settings are marked as deprecated, but the *Enforcement level* setting will not be available until December.

Applies to:

- Linux
- macOS

Samsung marked the Samsung Knox kiosk APIs used on Android device administrator as deprecated in Knox 3.7 (Android 11).

Though the functionality might continue to work, there's no guarantee that it will continue working. Samsung won't fix bugs that might arise. For more information on Samsung support for deprecated APIs, go to [What kind of support is offered after an API is deprecated?](https://docs.samsungknox.com/dev/knox-sdk/faqs/general/deprecated-api-support-change.htm) (opens Samsung's web site).

Instead, you can manage kiosk devices with Intune using [dedicated device management](../enrollment/android-kiosk-enroll.md).
 
Applies to:

- Android device administrator (DA)

#### Import and export settings catalog policies<!-- 3470151  -->  
The Intune [settings catalog](../configuration/settings-catalog.md) lists all the settings you can configure, and all in one place (**Devices** > **Configuration profiles** > **Create** > **New Policy** > Select your **platform** > For **Profile**, select **Settings catalog**).

The settings catalog policies can be imported and exported:

- To export an existing policy, select the profile > select the ellipsis > **Export JSON**.
- To import a previously exported settings catalog policy, select **Create** > **Import policy** > select the previously exported JSON file.

#### New setting to block users from using the same password to unlock the device and access the work profile on Android Enterprise personally owned devices with a work profile<!-- 6167371  -->  
On Android Enterprise personally owned devices with a work profile, users can use the same password to unlock the device and access the work profile.

There's a new setting that can enforce different passwords to unlock the device and access the work profile (**Devices** > **Configuration profiles** > **Create profile** > **Android Enterprise** > **Personally Owned Work Profile** for platform > **Device Restrictions** for profile type):

- **One lock for device and work profile**: **Block** prevents users from using the same password for the lock screen on the device and work profile. End users are required to enter the device password to unlock the device and enter their work profile password to access their work profile. When set to **Not Configured** (default), Intune doesn't change or update this setting. By default, the OS might allow users to access their work profile using a single password.

This setting is optional and doesn't impact existing configuration profiles.

Currently, if the work profile password doesn't meet the policy requirements, then device users see a notification. The device isn't marked as non-compliant. A separate compliance policy for the work profile is being created and will be available in a future release.

For a list of settings you can configure on personally owned devices with a work profile, go to [Android Enterprise device settings list to allow or restrict features on personally owned devices using Intune](../configuration/device-restrictions-android-enterprise-personal.md).

### Device security

#### Configure declarative software updates and passcode policies for Apple devices in the Settings Catalog<!-- 24989083  -->  

You can manage software updates and passcode using Apple's declarative device management (DDM) configuration using the settings catalog (**Devices** > **Configuration profiles** > **Create profile** > **iOS/iPadOS** or **macOS** for platform > **Settings catalog** for profile type > **Declarative device management**).

For more information about DDM, go to [Apple's declarative device management (DDM)](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/devicemanagement/leveraging_the_declarative_management_data_model_to_scale_devices) (opens Apple's website).

DDM allows you to install a specific update by an enforced deadline. The autonomous nature of DDM provides an improved user experience as the device handles the entire software update lifecycle. It prompts users that an update is available and also downloads, prepares the device for the installation, & installs the update. 

In the settings catalog, the following declarative software update settings are available at **Declarative device management > Software Update**:

- **Details URL**: The web page URL that shows the update details. Typically, this URL is a web page hosted by your organization that users can select if they need organization-specific help with the update.
- **Target Build Version**: The target build version to update the device to, like `20A242`. The build version can include a supplemental version identifier, like `20A242a`. If the build version you enter isn't consistent with the **Target OS Version** value you enter, then the **Target OS Version** value takes precedence.
- **Target Local Date Time**: The local date time value that specifies when to force install the software update. If the user doesn't trigger the software update before this time, then the device force installs it.
- **Target OS Version**: The target OS version to update the device to. This value is the OS version number, like `16.1`. You can also include a supplemental version identifier, like `16.1.1`.

For more information on this feature, go to [Manage software updates with the settings catalog](../protect/managed-software-updates-ios-macos.md).

In the settings catalog, the following declarative passcode settings are available at **Declarative device management > Passcode**:

- **Automatic Device Lock**: Enter the maximum time period that a user can be idle before the system automatically locks the device.
- **Maximum Grace Period**: Enter the maximum time period that a user can unlock the device without a passcode.
- **Maximum Number of Failed Attempts**: Enter the maximum number of wrong passcode attempts before:
  - iOS/iPadOS wipes the device
  - macOS locks the device
- **Minimum Passcode Length**: Enter the minimum number of characters a passcode must have.
- **Passcode Reuse Limit**: Enter the number of previously used passcodes that can't be used.
- **Require Complex Passcode**: When set to **True**, a complex passcode is required. A complex passcode doesn't have repeated characters, and doesn't have increasing or decreasing characters, like `123` or `CBA`.
- **Require Passcode on Device**: When set to **True**, the user must set a passcode to access the device. If you don't set other passcode restrictions, then there aren't any requirements about the length or quality of the passcode.

For information about the settings catalog, go to [Use the settings catalog to configure settings on Windows, iOS/iPadOS and macOS devices](../configuration/settings-catalog.md).

Applies to:

- iOS/iPadOS 17.0 and later

#### Updated reports for Update rings for Windows 10 and later<!-- 10159960 -->  
Reporting for [Update rings for Windows 10 and later](../protect/windows-10-update-rings.md) has been updated to use Intune's improved reporting infrastructure. These changes align to similar improvements introduced for other Intune features.

With this change for reports for Update rings for Windows 10 and later, when you select an update rings policy in the Intune admin center, there isn't a left-pane navigation for *Overview*, *Manage*, or *Monitor* options. Instead, the policy view opens to a single pane that includes the following policy details:

- **Essentials** – including the policy name, created and modified dates, and more details.
- **Device and user check-in status**  – This view is the default report view and includes:
  - A  high-level overview of device status for this policy, and a *View report* button to open a more comprehensive report view.
  - A streamlined representation and count of the different device status values returned by devices assigned to the policy. The simplified bar and chart replace former doughnut charts seen in the prior reporting representation.
- Two other report tiles to open more reports. These tiles include:
  - **Device assignment status** – This report combines the same information as the previous Device status and User status reports, which are no longer available. However, with this change, pivots and drill-in through based on the user name is no longer available.
  - **Per setting status** – This new report provides success metrics for each setting configured differently than the defaults, allowing for new insight to which settings might not be successfully deploying to your organization.
- **Properties** – View details for each configuration page of the policy, including an option to **Edit** each areas profile details.

For more information about reports for update rings for Windows 10 and later, see [Reports for Update rings for Windows 10 and later policy](../protect/windows-update-reports.md#reports-for-update-rings-for-windows-10-and-later-policy) in the Windows Update reports for Microsoft Intune article.

### Role-based access

## Week of September 4, 2023

### Device management

#### Microsoft Intune ending support for Android device administrator on devices with GMS access in August 2024<!--13891824 -->

Microsoft Intune is ending support for [Android device administrator management](../enrollment/android-enroll-device-administrator.md) on devices with access to Google Mobile Services (GMS) on August 30, 2024. After that date, device enrollment, technical support, bug fixes, and security fixes will be unavailable.  

If you currently use device administrator management, we recommend switching to another Android management option in Intune before support ends.
For more information, read [Ending support for Android device administrator on GMS devices](https://aka.ms/Intune-Android-DA-blog).

## Week of August 28, 2023

### Device configuration

#### Windows and Android support for 4096-bit key size for SCEP and PFX certificate profiles<!--16314561  -->

Intune [SCEP certificate profiles](../protect/certificates-profile-scep.md) and [PKCS certificate profiles](../protect/certificates-pfx-configure.md) for Windows and Android devices now support a **Key size (bits)** of **4096**. This key size is available for new profiles and existing profiles you choose to edit.

- SCEP profiles have always included the *Key size (bits)* setting and now support 4096 as an available configuration option.
- PKCS profiles don't include the *Key size (bits)* setting directly. Instead, an admin must [modify the certificate template on the Certification Authority](../protect/certificates-pfx-configure.md#configure-certificate-templates-on-the-ca) to set the *Minimum key size* to 4096.

If you use a third-party Certificate Authority (CA), you might need to contact your vendor for assistance with implementing the 4096-bit key size.

When updating or deploying new certificate profiles to take advantage of this new key size, we recommend using a staggered deployment approach. This approach can help avoid creating excessive demand for new certificates across a large number of devices at the same time.

With this update, be aware of the following limitations on Windows devices:

- 4096-bit key storage is supported only in the *Software Key Storage Provider* (KSP). The following don't support storing keys of this size:
  - The hardware TPM (Trusted Platform Module). As a workaround you can use the Software KSP for key storage.
  - Windows Hello for Business. There isn't a workaround at this time.

### Tenant administration

#### Access policies for multiple Administrator Approval are now generally available<!-- 24936423   -->
Access policies for multiple Administrator Approval are out of public preview and are now generally available. With these policies, you can protect a resource, like App deployments, by requiring any change to the deployment to be approved by one of a group of users who are *approvers* for the resource, before that change is applied.

For more information, see [Use Access policies to require multiple administrative approval](../fundamentals/multi-admin-approval.md).

For Android devices running Android 13 or higher that target API level 33, by default, applications don't have permission to send notifications. In previous versions of Managed Home Screen, when an admin had enabled automatic relaunch of Managed Home Screen, a notification was displayed to alert users of the relaunch. To accommodate change to notification permission, in the scenario when an admin has enabled auto-relaunch of Managed Home Screen, the application will now display a toast message alerting users of the relaunch. Managed Home Screen is able to auto-grant permission for this notification, so no change is required for admins configuring Managed Home Screen to accommodate the change in notification permission with API level 33. For more information about Android 13 (API level 33) notification messages, see the [Android developer documentation](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/views/notifications/notification-permission). For more information about Managed Home Screen, see [Configure the Microsoft Managed Home Screen app for Android Enterprise](../apps/app-configuration-managed-home-screen-app.md).

#### Win32 app configurable installation time<!-- 17644704  -->  
In Intune, you can set a configurable installation time to deploy Win32 apps. This time is expressed in minutes. If the app takes longer to install than the set installation time, the system will fail the app install. Max timeout value is 1440 minutes (1 day). For more information about Win32 apps, see [Win32 app management in Microsoft Intune](../apps/apps-win32-add.md#step-2-program).

#### Samsung Knox conditional launch check<!-- 8610063   -->  
You can add more detection of device health compromises on Samsung Knox devices. Using a conditional launch check within a new Intune App Protection Policy, you can require that hardware-level device tamper detection and device attestation be performed on compatible Samsung devices. For more information, see the **Samsung Knox device attestation** setting in the **Conditional launch** section of [Android app protection policy settings in Microsoft Intune](../apps/app-protection-policy-settings-android.md#device-conditions).

### Device enrollment

#### Just-in-time registration and compliance remediation for iOS/iPadOS Setup Assistant with modern authentication now generally available<!-- 16276610 -->

Just in time (JIT) registration and compliance remediation for Setup Assistant with modern authentication are now out of preview and generally available. With just in time registration, the device user doesn't need to use the Company Portal app for Microsoft Entra registration and compliance checking. JIT registration and compliance remediation are embedded into the user's provisioning experience, so they can view their compliance status and take action within the work app they're trying to access. Also, this establishes single-sign on across the device. For more information about how to set up JIT registration, see [Set up Just in Time Registration](../enrollment/automated-device-enrollment-authentication.md).

#### Awaiting final configuration for iOS/iPadOS automated device enrollment now generally available<!-- 17473384  -->  
Now generally available, *awaiting final configuration* enables a locked experience at the end of Setup Assistant to ensure that critical device configuration policies install on devices. The locked experience works on devices targeted with new and existing enrollment profiles. Supported devices include:

- iOS/iPadOS 13+ devices enrolling with Setup Assistant with modern authentication
- iOS/iPadOS 13+ devices enrolling without user affinity  
- iOS/iPadOS 13+ devices enrolling with Microsoft Entra ID shared mode  

This setting is applied once during the out-of-box automated device enrollment experience in Setup Assistant. The device user doesn't experience it again unless they re-enroll their device.  Awaiting final configuration is enabled by default for new enrollment profiles. For information about how to enable awaiting final configuration, see [Create an Apple enrollment profile](..//enrollment/device-enrollment-program-enroll-ios.md#create-an-apple-enrollment-profile).

### Device management

#### Changes to Android notification permission prompt behavior<!-- 19783177  -->  
We've updated how our Android apps handle notification permissions to align with recent changes made by Google to the Android platform.  As a result of Google changes, notification permissions are granted to apps as follows:

- **On devices running Android 12 and earlier**: Apps are permitted to send notifications to users by default.
- **On devices running Android 13 and later**: Notification permissions vary depending on the API the app targets.
  - *Apps targeting API 32 and lower*: Google has added a notification permission prompt that appears when the user opens the app. Management apps can still configure apps so that they're automatically granted notification permissions.
  - *Apps targeting API 33 and higher*: App developers define when the notification permission prompts appear. Management apps can still configure apps so that they're automatically granted notification permissions.

You and your device users can expect to see the following changes now that our apps target API 33:

- **Company Portal used for work profile management**: Users see a notification permission prompt in the personal instance of the Company Portal when they first open it. Users don't see a notification permission prompt in the work profile instance of Company Portal because notification permissions are automatically permitted for Company Portal in the work profile. Users can silence app notifications in the Settings app.
- **Company Portal used for device administrator management**: Users see a notification permission prompt when they first open the Company Portal app.  Users can adjust app notification settings in the Settings app.
- **Microsoft Intune app**: No changes to existing behavior. Users don't see a prompt because notifications are automatically permitted for the Microsoft Intune app.  Users can adjust some app notification settings in the Settings app.
- **Microsoft Intune app for AOSP**: No changes to existing behavior. Users don't see a prompt because notifications are automatically permitted for the Microsoft Intune app.  Users can't adjust app notification settings in the Settings app.

### Device security

#### Defender Update controls to deploy updates for Defender is now generally available<!-- 24666660 -->  
The profile **Defender Update controls** for Intune Endpoint security Antivirus policy, which manages update settings for Microsoft Defender, is now generally available. This profile is available for the *Windows 10, Windows 11, and Windows Server* platform. While in public preview, this profile was available for the *Windows 10 and later* platform.

The profile includes settings for the rollout release channel by which devices and users receive Defender Updates that are related to daily security intelligence updates, monthly platform updates, and monthly engine updates.

This profile includes the following settings, which are all directly taken from [Defender CSP - Windows Client Management](/windows/client-management/mdm/policy-csp-Defender).

- Engine Updates Channel
- Platform Updates Channel
- Security Intelligence Updates Channel

These settings are also available from the [settings catalog](../configuration/settings-catalog.md) for the *Windows 10 and later* profile.

#### Elevation report by applications for Endpoint Privilege Management<!-- 24593324 -->  
We've released a new report named **Elevation report by applications** for Endpoint Privilege Management (EPM). With [this new report](../protect/epm-reports.md#elevation-report-by-applications) you can view all managed and unmanaged elevations, which are aggregated by the application that elevated. This report can aid you in identifying applications that might require elevation rules to function properly, including rules for child processes.

You'll find the report in the Report node for EPM in the [Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431). Navigate to **Endpoint security** > **Endpoint Privilege Management** and then select the **Reports** tab.

#### New settings available for macOS Antivirus policy<!-- 24191427 -->  
The [Microsoft Defender Antivirus](../protect/endpoint-security-antivirus-policy.md) profile for macOS devices has been updated with nine more settings, and three new settings categories:

**Antivirus engine** – The following settings are new in this category:

- **Degree of parallelism for on-demand scans** – Specifies the degree of parallelism for on-demand scans. This setting corresponds to the number of threads used to perform the scan and impacts the CPU usage, and the duration of the on-demand scan.
- **Enable file hash computation** – Enables or disables file hash computation feature. When this feature is enabled, Windows Defender computes hashes for files it scans. This setting helps improve the accuracy of Custom Indicator matches. However, enabling Enable file hash computation can impact device performance.
- **Run a scan after definitions are updated** – Specifies whether to start a process scan after new security intelligence updates are downloaded on the device. Enabling this setting triggers an antivirus scan on the running processes of the device.
- **Scanning inside archive files** – If true, Defender unpacks archives and scan files inside them. Otherwise archive content is skipped, which improves scanning performance.

**Network protection** – A new category that includes the following setting:

- **Enforcement level** – Configure this setting to specify if network protection is *disabled*, *in audit mode*, or *enforced*.

**Tamper  protection** - A new category that includes the following setting:

- **Enforcement level** - Specify whether tamper protection is *disabled*, in *audit mode*, or *enforced*.

**User interface preferences** – A new category that includes the following settings:

- **Control sign-in to consumer version** - Specify whether users can sign into the consumer version of Microsoft Defender.
- **Show / hide status menu icon** – Specify whether the status menu icon (shown in the top-right corner of the screen) is hidden or not.
- **User initiated feedback** – Specify whether users can submit feedback to Microsoft by going to *Help* > *Send Feedback*.

New profiles that you create include the original settings and the new settings. Your existing profiles automatically update to include the new settings, with each new setting set to *Not configured* until you choose to edit that profile to change it.

For more information about how to set preferences for Microsoft Defender for Endpoint on macOS in enterprise organizations, see [Set preferences for Microsoft Defender for Endpoint on macOS](/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/mac-preferences?view=o365-worldwide&preserve-view=true).

### Intune apps

#### Anomaly detection device cohorts in Intune Endpoint analytics is generally available <!-- 24577118  -->  
Anomaly detection device cohorts in Intune Endpoint analytics is now generally available.

Device cohorts are identified in devices associated with a high or medium severity anomaly. Devices are correlated into groups based on one or more factors they have in common like an app version, driver update, OS version, device model. A correlation group will contain a detailed view with key information about the common factors between all affected devices in that group. You can also view a breakdown of devices currently affected by the anomaly and 'at risk' devices. "At risk" devices haven't yet shown symptoms of the anomaly.

For more information, go to [Anomaly detection in Endpoint analytics](../../analytics/anomaly-detection.md#anomalies-tab).

#### Improved user experience for device timeline in Endpoint Analytics<!-- 24604944 -->  
The user interface (UI) for device timeline in Endpoint analytics is improved and includes more advanced capabilities (support for sorting, searching, filtering, and exports). When viewing a specific device timeline in Endpoint analytics, you can search by event name or details. You can also filter the events and choose the source and level of events that appear on the device timeline and select a time range of interest.

For more information, go to [Enhanced device timeline](../../analytics/enhanced-device-timeline.md).

#### Updates for compliance policies and reports<!--15425771  -->  
We've made several improvements to the Intune compliance policies and reports. With these changes, the reports more closely align to the experience in use for device configuration profiles and reports. We've updated our [compliance report documentation](../protect/compliance-policy-monitor.md) to reflect the available compliance report improvements.

Compliance report improvements include:

- Compliance details for Linux devices.
- Redesigned reports that are up-to-date and simplified, with newer report versions beginning to replace older report versions, which will remain available for some time.
- When viewing a policy for compliance, there isn't a left-pane navigation. Instead, the policy view opens to a single pane that defaults to the Monitor tab and its Device status view.
  - This view provides a high-level overview of device status for this policy, supports drilling in to review the full report, and a per-setting status view of the same policy.
  - The doughnut chart is replaced by a streamlined representation and count of the different device status values returned by devices assigned the policy.
  - You can select the Properties tab to view the policy details, and review and edit its configuration and assignments.
  - The *Essentials* section is removed with those details appearing in the policy's *Properties* tab.
- The updated status reports support sorting by columns, the use of filters, and search. Combined, these enhancements enable you to pivot the report to display specific subsets of details you want to view at that time. With these enhancements, we have removed the *User status* report as it has become redundant. Now, while viewing the default *Device status* report you can focus the report to display the same information that was available from *User status* by sorting on the *User Principal Name* column, or searching for a specific username in the search box.
- When viewing status reports, the count of devices that Intune displays now remains consistent between different report views as you drill in for deeper insights or details.

For more information about these changes, see the Intune Support Team blog at [https://aka.ms/Intune/device_compl_report](https://aka.ms/Intune/device_compl_report).

### App management

#### Use the Turn off the Store application setting to disable end user access to Store apps, and allow managed Intune Store apps<!-- 16544362 -->  
In Intune, you can use the new **Store app** type to deploy Store apps to your devices.

Now, you can use the **Turn off the Store application** policy to disable end users' direct access to Store apps. When it's disabled, end users can still access and install Store apps from the Windows Company Portal app and through Intune app management. If you want to allow random store app installs outside of Intune, then don't configure this policy.

The previous **Only display the private store within the Microsoft Store app** policy doesn't prevent end users from directly accessing the store using the Windows Package Manager `winget` APIs. So, if your goal is to block random unmanaged Store application installs on client devices, then it's recommended to use the **Turn off the Store application** policy. Don't use the **Only display the private store within the Microsoft Store app** policy.

For more information, go to [Add Microsoft Store Apps to Microsoft Intune](../apps/store-apps-microsoft.md).

Applies to:

- Windows 10 and later

## Week of August 7, 2023

#### Compliance Retrieval service support for MAC address endpoints<!--  24332824  -->  
We've now added MAC address support to the Compliance Retrieval service.

The initial release of the CR service included support for using only the Intune device ID with the intent to eliminate the need to manage internal identifiers like serial numbers and MAC addresses. With this update, organizations that prefer to use MAC addresses over certificate authentication can continue to do so while implementing the CR service.

While this update adds MAC address support to the CR service, our recommendation is to use certificate-based authentication with the Intune device ID included in the certificate.

For information about the CR service as a replacement for the Intune Network Access Control (NAC) service, see the Intune blog at [https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/intune-customer-success/new-microsoft-intune-service-for-network-access-control/ba-p/2544696](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/intune-customer-success/new-microsoft-intune-service-for-network-access-control/ba-p/2544696).

#### Settings insight within Intune security baselines is generally available<!-- 24507891   -->

Navigate to **Endpoint security** > **Security baselines**. While creating and editing a workflow, these insights are available for all settings with light bulbs.

### Device security

#### Tamper protection support for Windows on Azure Virtual Desktop<!--15135590  -->  
Intune now supports use of endpoint security [Antivirus policy](../protect/endpoint-security-antivirus-policy.md#prerequisites-for-tamper-protection) to manage *Tamper protection* for Windows on Azure Virtual Desktop multi-session devices. Support for Tamper protection requires devices to onboard to Microsoft Defender for Endpoint before the policy that enables Tamper protection is applied.

#### EpmTools PowerShell module for Endpoint Privilege Management<!-- 22800379  -->  
The EpmTools PowerShell module is now available for use with Intune Endpoint Privilege Management (EPM). EpmTools includes the cmdlets like **Get-FileAttributes** that you can use to retrieve file details to help build accurate elevation rules, and other cmdlets you can use to troubleshoot or diagnose EPM policy deployments.

For more information, see [EpmTools PowerShell module](../protect/epm-overview.md#epmtools-powershell-module).

#### Endpoint Privilege Management support to manage elevation rules for child processes<!-- 15931887 -->  
With Intune Endpoint Privilege Management (EPM) you can manage which files and processes are allowed to *Run as Administrator* on your Windows devices.  Now, EPM [elevation rules](../protect/epm-policies.md#create-a-windows-elevation-rules-policy) support a new setting, **Child process behavior**.

With *Child process behavior*, your rules can manage the elevation context for any child processes created by the managed process. Options include:

- Allowing all child processes created by the managed process to always run as elevated.
- Allow a child process to run as elevated only when it matches the rule that manages its parent process.
- Deny all child processes from running in an elevated context, in which case they run as standard users.

Endpoint Privilege Management is available as an Intune add-on. For more information, see [Use Intune Suite add-on capabilities](../fundamentals/intune-add-ons.md).

The following protected app is now available for Microsoft Intune:

- Dooray! for Intune

For more information about protected apps, see [Microsoft Intune protected apps](../apps/apps-supported-intune-apps.md).

### Monitor and troubleshoot

#### Updated reports for Setting compliance and Policy compliance are in public preview<!-- 15425624, 15425656  -->  
We've released two new reports as a public preview for Intune device compliance. You can find these new preview reports in the Intune admin center at **Reports** > **Device compliance** > *Reports* tab:

- [Setting compliance (preview)](../fundamentals/reports.md)
- [Policy compliance (preview)](../fundamentals/reports.md)

Both reports are new instances of existing reports, and deliver improvements over the older versions, including:  

- Details for Linux settings and devices
- Support for sorting, searching, filtering, exports, and paging views
- Drill-down reports for deeper details, which are filtered based on the column you select.
- Devices are represented a single time. This behavior is in contrast to the original reports, which could count a device more than once if multiple users used that device.

Eventually, the [older report versions](../protect/compliance-policy-monitor.md#other-compliance-reports) that are still available in the admin center at *Devices > Monitor* will be retired.

  The Intune team thoroughly tested Android 13 on Zebra devices. Everything continues working as normal, except for the following two temporary issues for device administrator (DA) devices.

  For Zebra devices running Android 13 and enrolled with DA management:

  1. App installations don't happen silently. Instead, users get a notification from the Company Portal app (if they allow notifications) that asks for permission to allow the app installation. If a user doesn't accept the app installation when prompted, then the app doesn't install. Users will have a persistent notification in the notification drawer until they allow the installation.

  2. New MX profiles don't apply to Android 13 devices. Newly enrolled Android 13 devices don't receive configuration from MX profiles. MX profiles that previously applied to enrolled devices continue to apply.

  In an update coming later in July, these issues will be resolved and the behavior will return to how it was before.

- **Update devices to Android 13**

  You'll soon be able to use Intune's Zebra LifeGuard Over-the-Air integration to update Android Enterprise dedicated and fully managed devices to Android 13. For more information, go to [Zebra LifeGuard Over-the-Air Integration with Microsoft Intune](../protect/zebra-lifeguard-ota-integration.md).

  Before you migrate to Android 13, review [Migrating to Android 13](https://techdocs.zebra.com/lifeguard/a13/) (opens Zebra's web site).

- **OEMConfig for Zebra devices on Android 13**

  OEMConfig for Zebra devices on Android 13 requires using Zebra's new [Zebra OEMConfig Powered by MX OEMConfig app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.zebra.oemconfig.release) (opens the Google Play store). This new app can also be used on Zebra devices running Android 11, but not earlier versions.

  For more information on this app, go to the [New Zebra OEMConfig app for Android 11 and later](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/intune-customer-success/new-zebra-oemconfig-app-for-android-11-and-later/ba-p/3846730) blog post.

  The [Legacy Zebra OEMConfig app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.zebra.oemconfig.common) (opens the Google Play store) can only be used on Zebra devices running Android 11 and earlier.

For more general information about Intune Android 13 support, go to the [Day Zero support for Android 13 with Microsoft Intune](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/intune-customer-success/day-zero-support-for-android-13-with-microsoft-intune/ba-p/3601760) blog post.

### Device security

#### Defender for Endpoint security settings management enhancements and support for Linux and macOS in public preview<!-- 14743017, 15319901, 18713045, 18713050, 17757959 17757967, 17758270  -->  
With [Defender for Endpoint security settings management](../protect/mde-security-integration.md), you can use Intune's endpoint security policies to manage Defender security settings on devices that onboard to Defender for Endpoint but aren't enrolled with Intune.

Now, you can opt in to a public preview from within the Microsoft Defender portal to gain access to several enhancements for this scenario:

- Intune's endpoint security policies become visible in and can be managed from within the Microsoft Defender portal. This enables security admins to remain in the Defender portal to manage Defender and the Intune endpoint security policies for Defender security settings management.

- Security settings management supports deploying Intune endpoint security Antivirus policies to devices that run Linux and macOS.

- For Windows devices, the Windows Security Experience profile is now supported with security settings management.

- A new onboarding workflow removes the Microsoft Entra hybrid join prerequisite. Microsoft Entra hybrid join requirements prevented many Windows devices from successfully onboarding to Defender for Endpoint security settings management. With this change, those devices can now complete enrollment and start processing policies for security settings management.

- Intune creates a synthetic registration in Microsoft Entra ID for devices that can't fully register with Microsoft Entra ID. Synthetic registrations are device objects created in Microsoft Entra ID that enable devices to receive and report back on Intune policies for security settings management. In addition, should a device with a synthetic registration become fully registered, the synthetic registration is removed from Microsoft Entra ID in deference to the full registration.

If you don't opt in to the Defender for Endpoint Public Preview, the previous behaviors remain in place. In this case, while you can view the Antivirus profiles for Linux, you can't deploy it as its supported only for devices managed by Defender. Similarly, the macOS profile that's currently available for devices enrolled with Intune can't be deployed to devices managed by Defender.

Applies to:

- Linux
- macOS
- Windows

### Device management

#### Windows Driver update management in Intune is generally available<!-- 5584639  -->  
Announcing the general availability of **Windows Driver update management** in Microsoft Intune. With driver update policies, you can view a list of driver updates that are recommended and applicable to your Windows 10 and Windows 11 device that are assigned to the policy. Applicable driver updates are those that can update a device's driver version. Driver update policies update automatically to add new updates as they're published by the driver manufacturer and remove older drivers that no longer apply to any device with the policy.

Update policies can be configured for one of two approval methods:

- With *Automatic approval*, each new *recommended* driver that's published by the driver manufacturer and added to the policy is automatically approved for deployment to applicable devices. Policies set for automatic approvals can be configured with a deferral period before the automatically approved updates are installed on devices. This deferral gives you time to review the driver and to pause its deployment if necessary.

- With *manual approval*, all new driver updates are automatically added to the policy, but an admin must explicitly approve each update before Windows Update deploys it to a device. When you manually approve an update, you choose the date when Windows Update will begin to deploy it to your devices.

To help you manage driver updates, you review a policy and decline an update you don't want to install. You can also indefinitely pause any approved update, and reapprove a paused update to restart its deployment.

This release also includes [driver update reports](../protect/windows-update-reports.md#reports-for-windows-driver-updates-policy) that provide a success summary, per-device update status for each approved driver, and error and troubleshooting information. You can also select an individual driver update and view details about it across all the policies that include that driver version.

To learn about using Windows Driver update policies, see [Manage policy for Windows Driver updates with Microsoft Intune](../protect/windows-driver-updates-overview.md).

Applies to:

- Windows 10
- Windows 11

### Device management

#### New endpoint security Application Control policy in preview<!-- 15711976 -->  
As a public preview, you can use a new endpoint security policy category, Application Control. Endpoint security Application Control policy includes:

- Policy to set the Intune Management Extension as a tenant-wide managed installer. When enabled as a managed installer, apps you deploy through Intune (after enablement of Managed Installer) to Windows devices are tagged as installed by Intune. This tag becomes useful when you use Application Control policies to manage which apps you want to allow or block from running on your managed devices.

- Application Control policies that are an implementation of Defender Application Control (WDAC). With Endpoint security Application Control policies, it's easy to configure policy that allows trusted apps to run on your managed devices. Trusted apps are installed by a managed installer or from the App store. In addition to built-in trust settings, these policies also support custom XML for application control so you can allow other apps from other sources to run to meet your organizations requirements.

To get started with using this new policy type, see [Manage approved apps for Windows devices with Application Control policy and Managed Installers for Microsoft Intune](../protect/endpoint-security-app-control-policy.md)

#### Group policy analytics supports scope tags<!-- 12714882  -->  
In Group Policy analytics, you import your on-premises GPO. The tool analyzes your GPOs and shows the settings that can (and can't) be used in Intune.

When you import your GPO XML file in Intune, you can select an existing scope tag. If you don't select a scope tag, then the **Default** scope tag is automatically selected. Previously, when you imported a GPO, the scope tags assigned to you were automatically applied to the GPO.

Only admins within that scope tag can see the imported policies. Admins not in that scope tag can't see the imported policies.

Also, admins within their scope tag can migrate the imported policies that they have permissions to see. To migrate an imported GPO into a Settings Catalog policy, a scope tag must be associated with the imported GPO. If a scope tag isn't associated, then it can't migrate to a Settings Catalog policy. If no scope tag is selected, then a default scope tag is automatically applied.

### Device enrollment

#### Account driven Apple User Enrollment available for iOS/iPadOS 15+ devices (public preview)<!-- 14161683  -->  
Intune supports account driven user enrollment, a new and improved variation of Apple User Enrollment for iOS/iPadOS 15+ devices. Now available for public preview, the new option utilizes just-in-time registration, which eliminates the need for the Company Portal app during enrollment. Device users can initiate enrollment directly in the Settings app, resulting in a shorter and more efficient onboarding experience. You can continue to target iOS/iPadOS devices using the existing profile-based user enrollment method that uses Company Portal. Devices running iOS/iPadOS, version 14.8.1 and earlier remain unaffected by this update and can continue to use the existing method. For more information, see [Set up account driven Apple User Enrollment](../enrollment/apple-account-driven-user-enrollment.md).  

### Device security

#### New security baseline for Microsoft 365 Office Apps<!-- 9587103  -->  
We've released a new security baseline to help you manage security configurations for **M365 Office Apps**. This new baseline uses an updated template and experience that uses the unified settings platform seen in the Intune settings catalog. You can view the list of settings in the new baseline at [Microsoft 365 Apps for Enterprise baseline settings (Office)](../protect/security-baseline-v2-office-settings.md).

The new Intune security baseline format aligns the presentation of settings that are available to the settings found in the Intune settings catalog. This alignment helps resolve past issues for setting names and implementations for settings that could create conflicts. The new format also improves the reporting experience for baselines in the Intune admin center.

The Microsoft 365 Office Apps baseline can help you rapidly deploy configurations to your Office Apps that meet the security recommendations of the Office and security teams at Microsoft. As with all baselines, the default baseline represents the recommended configurations. You can modify the default baseline to meet the requirements of your organization.

To learn more, see [Security baselines overview](../protect/security-baselines.md).

Applies to:

- Windows 10
- Windows 11

#### Security baseline update for Microsoft Edge version 112<!-- 3408610  -->  
We've released a new version of the Intune security baseline for Microsoft Edge, version 112. In addition to releasing this new version for Microsoft Edge, the new baseline uses an updated template experience that uses the unified settings platform seen in the Intune settings catalog. You can view the list of settings in the new baseline at [Microsoft Edge baseline settings (version 112 and higher)](../protect/security-baseline-v2-edge-settings.md).

The new Intune security baseline format aligns the presentation of settings that are available to the settings found in the Intune settings catalog. This alignment helps resolve past issues for setting names and implementations for settings that could create conflicts. The new format also improves the reporting experience for baselines in the Intune admin center.

Now that the new baseline version is available, all new profiles you create for Microsoft Edge use the new baseline format and version. While the new version becomes the default baseline version, you can continue to use the profiles you've previously created for older versions of Microsoft Edge. But, you can't create new profiles for those older versions of Microsoft Edge.

To learn more, see [Security baselines overview](../protect/security-baselines.md).

Applies to:

- Windows 10
- Windows 11
