## Week of September 23, 2024 (Service release 2409)

### App management

#### Working Time settings for app protection policies<!-- 14631539 -->

Working time settings allow you to enforce policies that limit access to apps and mute message notifications received from apps during non-working time. The limit access setting is now available for the Microsoft Teams and Microsoft Edge apps. You can limit access by using App Protection Policies (APP) to block or warn end users from using the iOS/iPadOS or Android Teams and Edge apps during non-working time by setting the **Non-working time** conditional launch setting. Also, you can create a non-working time policy to mute notifications from the Teams app to end users during non-working time.

Applies to:

- Android
- iOS/iPadOS

#### Streamlined app creation experience for apps from Enterprise App Catalog<!-- 29411991 -->

We've streamlined the way apps from Enterprise App Catalog are added to Intune. We now provide a direct app link rather than duplicating the app binaries and metadata. App contents now download from a `*.manage.microsoft.com` subdomain. This update helps to improve the latency when adding an app to Intune. When you add an app from Enterprise App Catalog, it syncs immediately and is ready for additional action from within Intune.

#### Update Enterprise App Catalog apps<!-- 24875279 -->

Enterprise App Management is enhanced to allow you to update an **Enterprise App Catalog** app. This capability guides you through a wizard that allows you to add a new application and use supersedence to update the previous application.

For more information, see [Guided update supersedence for Enterprise App Management](../apps/apps-eam-supersedence.md).

### Device configuration

#### Samsung ended support for multiple Android device administrator (DA) settings <!-- 24990472 -->

On Android device administrator managed (DA) devices, Samsung has deprecated many [Samsung Knox APIs](https://docs.samsungknox.com/dev/knox-sdk/api-reference/deprecated-api-methods/) (opens Samsung's web site) configuration settings.

In Intune, this deprecation impacts the following device restrictions settings, compliance settings, and trusted certificate profiles:

- [Device restriction settings for Android in Microsoft Intune](../configuration/device-restrictions-android.md)
- [View the Android device administrator compliance settings for Microsoft Intune compliance policies](../protect/compliance-policy-create-android.md)
- [Create trusted certificate profiles in Microsoft Intune](../protect/certificates-trusted-root.md#trusted-certificate-profiles-for-android-device-administrator)

In the Intune admin center, when you create or update a profile with these settings, the impacted settings are noted.

Though the functionality might continue to work, there's no guarantee that it will continue working for any or all Android DA versions supported by Intune. For more information on Samsung support for deprecated APIs, see [What kind of support is offered after an API is deprecated?](https://docs.samsungknox.com/dev/knox-sdk/faqs/general/deprecated-api-support-change.htm) (opens Samsung's web site).

Instead, you can manage Android devices with Intune using one of the following Android Enterprise options:

- [Set up enrollment of Android Enterprise personally owned work profile devices](../enrollment/android-work-profile-enroll.md)
- [Set up Intune enrollment of Android Enterprise corporate-owned devices with work profile](../enrollment/android-corporate-owned-work-profile-enroll.md)
- [Set up enrollment for Android Enterprise fully managed devices](../enrollment/android-fully-managed-enroll.md)
- [Set up Intune enrollment of Android Enterprise dedicated devices](../enrollment/android-kiosk-enroll.md)
- [App protection policies overview](../apps/app-protection-policy.md)

Applies to:

- Android device administrator (DA)

#### Device Firmware Configuration Interface (DFCI) supports VAIO devices <!-- 28186944 -->

For Windows 10/11 devices, you can create a DFCI profile to manage UEFI (BIOS) settings.

#### Consent prompt update for remote log collection<!-- 28072852 -->

End users might see a different consent experience for remote log collection after the Android APP SDK 10.4.0 and iOS APP SDK 19.6.0 updates. End users will no longer see a common prompt from Intune and will only see a prompt from the application, if it has one.

Adoption of this change is per-application and is subject to each applications release schedule.

Applies to:

- Android
- iOS/iPadOS

### Device enrollment

#### New Setup Assistant screens available for configuration for ADE <!-- 26607203, 2532989 -->

New Setup Assistant screens are available to configure in the Microsoft Intune admin center. You can hide or show these screens during automated device enrollment (ADE).

For macOS:

- **Wallpaper**: Show or hide the macOS Sonoma wallpaper setup pane that appears after an upgrade on devices running macOS 14.1 and later.
- **Lockdown mode**: Show or hide the lockdown mode setup pane on devices running macOS 14.1 and later.
- **Intelligence**: Show or hide the Apple Intelligence setup pane on devices running macOS 15 and later.

For iOS/iPadOS:

- **Emergency SOS**: Show or hide the safety setup pane on devices running iOS/iPadOS 16 and later.

- [Set up Apple automated device enrollment for Macs](../enrollment/device-enrollment-program-enroll-macos.md)

#### Extended expiration date for corporate-owned, user-associated AOSP enrollment tokens<!-- 25782149 -->

Now when you create an enrollment token for Android Open Source Project (AOSP) corporate-owned, user-associated devices, you can select an expiration date that's up to 65 years into the future, an improvement over the previous 90 day expiration date. You can also modify the expiration date of existing enrollment tokens for Android Open Source Project (AOSP) corporate-owned, user-associated devices.

### Device security

#### New disk encryption template for Personal Data Encryption<!-- 28677934 -->

You can now use the new *Personal Data Encryption* (PDE) template that is available through endpoint security [*disk encryption* policy](../protect/encrypt-devices.md). This new template configures the Windows [PDE configuration service provider](/windows/client-management/mdm/personaldataencryption-csp) (CSP), which was introduced in Windows 11 22H2. The PDE CSP is also available through the settings catalog.

PDE differs from BitLocker in that it encrypts files instead of whole volumes and disks. PDE occurs in addition to other encryption methods such as BitLocker. Unlike BitLocker that releases data encryption keys at boot, PDE doesn't release data encryption keys until a user signs in using Windows Hello for Business.

Applies to:

- Windows 11 version 22h2 or later

For more information about PDE, including prerequisites, related requirements, and recommendations, see the following articles in the Windows security documentation:

- [PDE overview](/windows/security/operating-system-security/data-protection/personal-data-encryption/)
- [Configure PDE](/windows/security/operating-system-security/data-protection/personal-data-encryption/configure)
- [PDE frequently asked questions (FAQ)](/windows/security/operating-system-security/data-protection/personal-data-encryption/faq)

### Intune Apps

The following protected app is now available for Microsoft Intune:

- Notate for Intune by Shafer Systems, LLC

For more information about protected apps, see [Microsoft Intune protected apps](../apps/apps-supported-intune-apps.md).

## Week of September 9, 2024

### App management

#### Managed Home Screen user experience update<!-- 28232751 -->

All Android devices automatically migrate to the updated Managed Home Screen (MHS) user experience. For more information, see [Updates to the Managed Home Screen experience](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/intune-customer-success/updates-to-the-managed-home-screen-experience/bc-p/3997842).

### Device enrollment

#### Support has ended for Apple profile-based user enrollment with Company Portal<!-- 28361917 -->

Apple supports two types of manual enrollment methods for users and devices in bring-your-own-device (BYOD) scenarios: *profile-based enrollment* and *account-driven enrollment*. Apple has ended support for profile-based user enrollment, known in Intune as *user enrollment with Company Portal*. This method was their privacy-focused BYOD enrollment flow that used managed Apple IDs. As a result of this change, Intune has ended support for [profile-based user enrollment with Company Portal](../enrollment/apple-user-enrollment-with-company-portal.md). Users can no longer enroll devices targeted with this enrollment profile type. Devices already enrolled with this profile type aren't impacted by this change, so you can continue to manage them in the admin center and receive Microsoft Intune technical support. Less than 1% of Apple devices across all Intune tenants are currently enrolled this way, so this change doesn't affect the majority of enrolled devices.

There is no change to profile-based device enrollment with Company Portal, the default enrollment method for BYOD scenarios. Devices enrolled via Apple automated device enrollment also remain unaffected.

We recommend account-driven user enrollment as a replacement method for devices. For more information about your BYOD enrollment options in Intune, see:

- [Account-driven user enrollment](../enrollment/apple-account-driven-user-enrollment.md)
- [Web-based device enrollment](../enrollment/web-based-device-enrollment-ios.md)
- [Device enrollment with Company Portal](../enrollment/ios-device-enrollment.md#app-or-web-based-enrollment) (default enrollment method for BYOD scenarios)

For more information about the device enrollment types supported by Apple, see [Intro to Apple device enrollment types](https://support.apple.com/en-mide/guide/deployment/dep08f54fcf6/web) in the Apple Platform Deployment guide.

### Device management

#### Intune now supports iOS/iPadOS 16.x as the minimum version<!-- 28391935 -->

Later this year, we expect iOS 18 and iPadOS 18 to be released by Apple. Microsoft Intune, including the Intune Company Portal and Intune app protection policies (APP, also known as MAM), will require iOS/iPadOS 16 and higher shortly after the iOS/iPadOS 18 release.

For more information on this change, see [Plan for change: Intune is moving to support iOS/iPadOS 16 and later](whats-new.md#plan-for-change-intune-is-moving-to-support-iosipados-16-and-later).

> [!NOTE]
> Userless iOS and iPadOS devices enrolled through Automated Device Enrollment (ADE) have a slightly nuanced support statement due to their shared usage. For more information, see [Support statement for supported versus allowed iOS/iPadOS versions for user-less devices](https://aka.ms/ADE_userless_support).

Applies to:

- iOS/iPadOS

#### Intune now supports macOS 13.x as the minimum version<!-- 28391869 -->

With Apple's release of macOS 15 Sequoia, Microsoft Intune, the Company Portal app, and the Intune MDM agent will now require macOS 13 (Ventura) and later.

For more information on this change, see [Plan for change: Intune is moving to support macOS 13 and later](whats-new.md#plan-for-change-intune-is-moving-to-support-macos-13-and-higher-later-this-year)

> [!NOTE]
> macOS devices enrolled through Automated Device Enrollment (ADE) have a slightly nuanced support statement due to their shared usage. For more information, see [Support statement](https://aka.ms/Intune/macOS/ADE-DE-support).

Applies to:

- macOS

## Week of August 19, 2024 (Service release 2408)

### Microsoft Intune Suite

#### Easy creation of Endpoint Privilege Management elevation rules from support approval requests and reports<!-- 28196775 -->

You can now create Endpoint Privilege Management (EPM) elevation rules directly from a support approved elevation request or from details found in the EPM Elevation report. With this new capability, you wonâ€™t need to manually identify specific file detection details for elevation rules. Instead, for files that appear in the Elevation report or a support approved elevation request, you can select that file to open its elevation detail pane, and then select the option to **Create a rule with these file details**.

When you use this option, you can then choose to add the new rule to one of your existing elevation policies, or create a new policy with only the new rule.

Applies to:

- Windows 10
- Windows 11

For information about this new capability, see [Windows elevation rules policy](../protect/epm-policies.md) in the *Configure policies for Endpoint Privilege management* article.

#### Introducing the Resource performance report for physical devices in Advanced Analytics<!-- 12659827 -->

We're introducing the Resource performance report for Windows physical devices in Intune Advanced Analytics. The report is included as an Intune-add on underâ€¯Microsoft Intune Suite.

The resource performance scores and insights for physical devices are aimed to help IT admins make CPU/RAM asset management and purchase decisions that improve the user experience while balancing hardware costs.

For more information, see:

- [Resource Performance Report](../../analytics/resource-performance-report.md)
- [Microsoft Intune Suite](../fundamentals/intune-add-ons.md)

### App management

#### Managed Home Screen for Android Enterprise Fully Managed devices<!-- 15603355 -->

Managed Home Screen (MHS) is now supported on Android Enterprise Fully Managed devices. This capability offers organizations the ability to leverage MHS in scenarios where a device is associated with a single user.

- [Configure permissions for the Managed Home Screen (MHS) on Android Enterprise devices using Microsoft Intune](../configuration/oemconfig-managed-home-screen-permissions-android.md)

#### Updates to the Discovered Apps report<!-- 28898418 -->

The **Discovered Apps** report, which provides a list of detected apps that are on Intune enrolled devices for your tenant, now provides publisher data for Win32 apps, in addition to Store apps. Rather than providing publisher information only in the exported report data, we are including it as a column in the **Discovered Apps** report.

For more information, see [Intune Discovered apps](../apps/app-discovered-apps.md#monitor-discovered-apps-with-intune).

#### Improvements to Intune Management Extension logs<!-- 26113668 -->

We have updated how log activities and events are made for Win32 apps and the Intune Management Extension (IME) logs. A new log file (*AppWorkload.log*) contains all logging information related to app deployment activities conducted by the IME. These improvements provide better troubleshooting and analysis of app management events on the client.

For more information, see [Intune management extension logs](../apps/intune-management-extension.md#intune-management-extension-logs).

### Device configuration

#### New settings available in the Apple settings catalog <!-- 28308531 -->

The [Settings Catalog](../configuration/settings-catalog.md) lists all the settings you can configure in a device policy, and all in one place. For more information about configuring Settings Catalog profiles in Intune, see [Create a policy using settings catalog](../configuration/settings-catalog.md).

#### Enhancements to multi administrative approval<!-- 25174473 -->

Multi administrative approval adds the ability to limit application access policies to Windows applications or all non-Windows applications or both. We're adding a new access policy to the multiple administrative approval feature to allow approvals for changes to multiple administrative approval.

For more information, see [Multi admin approval](../fundamentals/multi-admin-approval.md).

### Device enrollment

#### Account-driven Apple User Enrollment now generally available for iOS/iPadOS 15+<!-- 10277062 -->

Intune now supports account-driven Apple User Enrollment, the new, and improved version of Apple User Enrollment, for devices running iOS/iPadOS 15 and later. This new enrollment method utilizes just-in-time registration, removing the Company Portal app for iOS as an enrollment requirement. Device users can initiate enrollment directly in the Settings app, resulting in a shorter and more efficient onboarding experience.

For more information, see [Set up account driven Apple User Enrollment](../enrollment/apple-account-driven-user-enrollment.md) on Microsoft Learn.

Apple has announced they are ending support for profile-based Apple User Enrollment. As a result, Microsoft Intune will end support for Apple User Enrollment with Company Portal shortly after the release of iOS/iPadOS 18. We recommend enrolling devices with account-driven Apple User Enrollment for similar functionality and an improved user experience.

#### Use corporate Microsoft Entra account to enable Android Enterprise management options in Intune<!-- 25231452 -->

Managing Intune-enrolled devices with Android Enterprise management options previously required you to connect your Intune tenant to your managed Google Play account using an enterprise Gmail account. Now you can use a corporate Microsoft Entra account to establish the connection. This change is happening in new tenants, and doesn't affect tenants that have already established a connection.

For more information, see [Connect Intune account to Managed Google Play account - Microsoft Intune | Microsoft Learn](../enrollment/connect-intune-android-enterprise.md).

### Device management

#### 21 Vianet support for Mobile Threat Defense connectors<!-- 10355489 -->

Intune operated by 21Vianet now supports Mobile Threat Defense (MTD) connectors for Android and iOS/iPadOS devices for MTD vendors that also have support in that environment. When an MTD partner is supported and you sign in to a 21Vianet tenant, the supported connectors are available.

Applies to:

- Android
- iOS/iPadOS

For more information, see:

- [Intune operated by 21Vianet in China](../fundamentals/china.md)
- [Mobile Threat Defense integration with Intune](../protect/mobile-threat-defense.md)

### Device security

#### Windows platform name change for endpoint security policies<!-- 16104088 -->

When you create an endpoint security policy in Intune, you can select the Windows platform. For multiple templates in endpoint security, there are now only two options to choose for the Windows platform: **Windows** and **Windows (ConfigMgr)**.

Specifically, the platform name changes are:

| Original | New |
| --- | --- |
| Windows 10 and laterâ€‹ | Windows |
| Windows 10 and later (ConfigMgr)â€‹ | Windows (ConfigMgr)â€‹ |
| Windows 10, Windows 11, and Windows Server | Windows |
| Windows 10, Windows 11, and Windows Serverâ€‹ (ConfigMgr) | Windows (ConfigMgr)â€‹ |

These changes apply to the following policies:

- Antivirus
- Disk encryption
- Firewall
- Endpoint Privilege Management
- Endpoint detection and response
- Attack surface reduction
- Account protection

##### What you need to know

- This change is only in the user experience (UX) that admins see when they create a new policy. There is no effect on devices.
- The functionally is the same as the previous platform names.
- There are no additional tasks or actions for existing policies.

For more information on endpoint security features in Intune, see [Manage endpoint security in Microsoft Intune](../protect/endpoint-security.md).

Applies to:

- Windows

#### Target Date Time setting for Apple software update enforcement schedules updates using the local time on devices <!-- 28865232 -->

You can specify the time that OS updates are enforced on devices in their local time zone. For example, configuring an OS update to be enforced at 5pm schedules the update for 5pm in the device's local time zone. Previously, this setting used the time zone of the browser where the policy was configured.

This change only applies to new policies that are created in the August 2408 release and later. The **Target Date Time** setting is in the settings catalog at **Devices** > **Manage devices** > **Configuration** > **Create** > **New policy** > **iOS/iPadOS** or **macOS** for platform > **Settings catalog** for profile type > **Declarative Device Management** > Software Update.

In a future release, the **UTC** text will be removed from the **Target Date Time** setting.

For more information on using the settings catalog to configure software updates, see [Managed software updates with the settings catalog](../protect/managed-software-updates-ios-macos.md).

Applies to:

- iOS/iPadOS

#### Organizational messages now in Microsoft 365 admin center<!-- 27711197 -->

The organizational message feature has moved out of the Microsoft Intune admin center and into its new home in the Microsoft 365 admin center. All organizational messages you created in Microsoft Intune are now in the Microsoft 365 admin center, where you can continue to view and manage them. The new experience includes highly requested features such as the ability to author custom messages, and deliver messages on Microsoft 365 apps.

For more information, see:

- [Introducing organizational messages (preview) in the Microsoft 365 admin center](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-365-blog/introducing-organizational-messages-preview-in-the-microsoft-365/ba-p/4123890)

### Device enrollment

#### ACME protocol support for iOS/iPadOS and macOS enrollment<!-- 25140355 -->

As we prepare to support managed device attestation in Intune, we are starting a phased rollout of an infrastructure change for new enrollments that includes support for the *Automated Certificate Management Environment (ACME) protocol*. Now when new Apple devices enroll, the management profile from Intune receives an ACME certificate instead of a SCEP certificate. ACME provides better protection than SCEP against unauthorized certificate issuance through robust validation mechanisms and automated processes, which helps reduce errors in certificate management.

Existing OS and hardware eligible devices do not get the ACME certificate unless they re-enroll. There is no change to the end user's enrollment experience, and no changes to the Microsoft Intune admin center. This change only impacts enrollment certificates and has no impact on any device configuration policies.

ACME is supported for Apple Device Enrollment, Apple Configurator enrollment, and Automated device enrollment (ADE) methods. Eligible OS versions include:

- iOS 16.0 or later
- iPadOS 16.1 or later
- macOS 13.1 or later

## Week of July 22, 2024 (Service release 2407)

### Device enrollment

#### Update for Apple user and device enrollments with Company Portal <!-- 27557088 -->

We've made changes to the device registration process for Apple devices enrolling with Intune Company Portal. Previously, Microsoft Entra device registration occurred during enrollment. With this change, registration occurs after enrollment.

Existing enrolled devices are not affected by this change. For new user or device enrollments that utilize Company Portal, users must return to Company Portal to complete registration:

- For iOS users: Users with notifications enabled will be prompted to return to the Company Portal app for iOS. If they disable notifications, they won't be alerted, but still need to return to Company Portal to complete registration.

- For macOS devices: The Company Portal app for macOS will detect the installation of the management profile and automatically register the device, unless the user closes the app. If they close the app, they must reopen it to complete registration.

If you're using dynamic groups, which rely on device registration to work, it's important for users to complete device registration. Update your user guidance and admin documentation as needed. If you're using Conditional Access (CA) policies, no action is required. When users attempt to sign in to a CA-protected app, they will be prompted to return to Company Portal to complete registration.

These changes are currently rolling out and will be made available to all Microsoft Intune tenants by the end of July. There's no change to the Company Portal user interface. For more information about device enrollment for Apple devices, see:

- [Enrollment guide: Enroll macOS devices in Microsoft Intune](../fundamentals/deployment-guide-enrollment-macos.md#device-enrollment-end-user-tasks)

### Monitor and troubleshoot

#### View BitLocker recovery key in Company Portal apps for iOS and macOS<!-- 26615990 -->

End users can view the BitLocker recovery key for an enrolled Windows device and the FileVault recovery key for an enrolled Mac in the Company Portal app for iOS and Company Portal app for macOS. This capability will reduce helpdesk calls in the event the end user gets locked out of their corporate machines. End users can access the recovery key for an enrolled device by signing into the Company Portal app and selecting **Get recovery key**. This experience is similar to the recovery process on the Company Portal website, which also allows end users to see recovery keys.

You can prevent end users within your organization from accessing BitLocker recovery keys by configuring the **Restrict non-admin users from recovering the BitLocker keys for their owned device** setting in Microsoft Entra ID.

Applies to:

- macOS
- Windows 10/11

For more information, see:

- [Manage BitLocker policy for Windows devices with Intune](../protect/encrypt-devices.md)

### Role-based access control

#### New granular RBAC controls for Intune endpoint security<!-- 5475572 -->

Weâ€™ve begun to replace the role-based access control (RBAC) rights to endpoint security policies that are granted by the *Security baselines* permission with a series of more granular permissions for specific endpoint security tasks. This change can help you assign the specific rights your Intune admins require to do specific jobs instead of relying on either the [built-in](../fundamentals/role-based-access-control.md#built-in-roles) *Endpoint Security Manager* role or a [custom role](../fundamentals/create-custom-role.md) that includes the *Security baseline* permission. Prior to this change, the *Security baseline* permission grants rights across all endpoint security policies.

The following new RBAC permissions are available for endpoint security workloads:

- App Control for Business
- Attack surface reduction
- Endpoint detection and response

Each new permission supports the following rights for the related policy:

- Assign
- Create
- Delete
- Read
- Update
- View Reports

Each time we add a new granular permission for an endpoint security policy to Intune, those same rights are removed from the *Security baselines* permission. If you use custom roles with the *Security baselines* permission, the new RBAC permission is assigned automatically to your custom roles with the same rights that were granted through the *Security baseline* permission. This auto-assignment ensures your admins continue to have the same permissions they have today.

For more information about current RBAC permissions and built-in roles, see:

- [Role-based access control (RBAC) with Microsoft Intune](../fundamentals/role-based-access-control.md)
- [Built-in role permissions for Microsoft Intune](../fundamentals/role-based-access-control-reference.md)
- [Assign role-based access controls for endpoint security policy](../protect/endpoint-security-policy.md#assign-role-based-access-controls-for-endpoint-security-policy) in *Manage device security with endpoint security policies in Microsoft Intune*.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> With this release, the granular permission of **Antivirus** for endpoint security policies might be temporarily visible in some Tenants. This permission is not released and isn't supported for use. Configurations of the *Antivirus* permission are ignored by Intune. When *Antivirus* becomes available to use as a granular permission, it's availability will be announced in this [What's new in Microsoft Intune](../fundamentals/whats-new.md) article.

## Week of June 3, 2024

### Device enrollment

#### New enrollment time grouping feature for devices <!-- 16902437 -->

Enrollment time grouping is a new, faster way to group devices during enrollment. When it's configured, Intune adds devices to the appropriate group without requiring inventory discovery and dynamic membership evaluations. To set up enrollment time grouping, you must configure a static Microsoft Entra security group in each enrollment profile. After a device enrolls, Intune adds it to the static security group and delivers assigned apps and policies.

This feature is available for Windows 11 devices enrolling via Windows Autopilot device preparation. For more information, see [Enrollment time grouping in Microsoft Intune](../enrollment/enrollment-time-grouping.md).

### Microsoft Intune Suite

#### New primary endpoint for Remote Help

To improve the experience for [Remote Help](../fundamentals/remote-help.md) on Windows, Web, and macOS devices, we have updated the primary endpoint for Remote Help:

- Old primary endpoint: `https://remoteassistance.support.services.microsoft.com`
- New primary endpoint: `https://remotehelp.microsoft.com`

If you use Remote Help and have firewall rules that block the new primary endpoint, admins and users might experience connectivity issues or disruptions when using Remove Help.

To support the new primary endpoint on Windows devices, upgrade Remote Help to version 5.1.124.0. Web and macOS devices don't require an updated version of Remote Help to make use of the new primary endpoint.

Applies to:

- macOS 11, 12, 13 and 14
- Windows 10/11
- Windows 11 on ARM64 devices
- Windows 10 on ARM64 devices
- Windows 365

For information on the newest version of Remote Help, see the *March 13, 2024* entry for [What's New for Remote Help](../fundamentals/remote-help-windows.md#march-13-2024). For information about Intune endpoints for Remote Help, see [Remote Help](../fundamentals/intune-endpoints.md#remote-help) in *Network endpoints for Microsoft Intune*.

### Device security

#### Windows Firewall CSP changes for processing Firewall Rules<!-- 10734904 -->

Windows changed how the Firewall configuration service provider (CSP) enforces rules from Atomic blocks of firewall rules. The Windows Firewall CSP on a device implements the firewall rule settings from your [Intune endpoint security Firewall policies](../protect/endpoint-security-firewall-policy.md). The change of CSP behavior now enforces an all-or-nothing application of firewall rules from each Atomic block of rules.

- Previously, the CSP on a device would go through the firewall rules in an Atomic block of rules - one rule (or setting) at a time with the goal of applying all the rules in that Atomic block, or none of them. If the CSP encountered any issue with applying any rule from the block to the device, the CSP wouldn't only stop that rule, but also cease to process subsequent rules without trying to apply them. However, rules that applied successfully before a rule failed, would remain applied to the device. This behavior can lead to a partial deployment of firewall rules on a device, since the rules that were applied before a rule failed to apply aren't reversed.

- With the change to the Firewall CSP, when any rule in the block is unsuccessful in applying to the device, all the rules from that same Atomic block that were applied successfully are rolled back. This behavior ensures the desired all-or-nothing behavior is implemented and prevents a partial deployment of firewall rules from that block. For example, if a device receives an Atomic block of firewall rules that has a misconfigured rule that can't apply, or has a rule that isn't compatible with the devices operating system, then the CSP fails all the rules from that block, And, it rolls back any rules that applied to that device.

This change of Firewall CSP behavior is available on devices that run the following Windows versions or later:

- Windows 11 21H2
- Windows 11 22H2
- Windows 10 21H2

For more information on the subject of how the Windows Firewall CSP uses Atomic blocks to contain firewall rules, see the note near the top of [Firewall CSP](/windows/client-management/mdm/firewall-csp) in the Windows documentation.

For troubleshooting guidance, see the Intune support blog [How to trace and troubleshoot the Intune Endpoint Security Firewall rule creation process](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/intune-customer-success/how-to-trace-and-troubleshoot-the-intune-endpoint-security/ba-p/3261452).

#### CrowdStrike â€“ New mobile threat defense partner<!-- 16882021 -->
