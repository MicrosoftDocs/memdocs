### App management

#### Exchange On-Premises Connector support<!-- 7138486  -->
Intune is removing support for the Exchange On-Premises Connector feature from the Intune service beginning in the 2007 (July) release. Existing customers with an active connector will be able to continue with the current functionality at this time. New customers and existing customers that do not have an active connector will no longer be able to create new connectors or manage Exchange ActiveSync (EAS) devices from Intune. For those customers, Microsoft recommends the use of Exchange [hybrid modern authentication (HMA)](https://docs.microsoft.com/office365/enterprise/hybrid-modern-auth-overview) to protect access to Exchange on-premises. HMA enables both Intune App Protection Policies (also known as MAM) and Conditional Access through Outlook Mobile for Exchange on-premises.

#### S/MIME for Outlook on iOS and Android devices without enrollment<!-- 6517155 -->
You can now enable S/MIME for Outlook on iOS and Android devices using an app configuration policy for managed apps. This allows for policy delivery regardless of device enrollment state. In [Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431), select **Apps** > **App configuration policies** > **Add** > **Managed apps**. Additionally, you can choose whether or not to allow users to change this setting in Outlook. However, to automatically deploy S/MIME certificates to Outlook for iOS and Android, the device must be enrolled. For general information about S/MIME, see [S/MIME overview to sign and encrypt email in Intune](https://docs.microsoft.com/mem/intune/protect/certificates-s-mime-encryption-sign). For more information about Outlook configuration settings, see [Microsoft Outlook configuration settings](../apps/app-configuration-policies-outlook.md) and [Add app configuration policies for managed apps without device enrollment](../apps/app-configuration-policies-managed-app.md). For Outlook for iOS and Android S/MIME information, see [S/MIME scenarios](https://docs.microsoft.com/exchange/clients-and-mobile-in-exchange-online/outlook-for-ios-and-android/outlook-for-ios-and-android-configuration-with-microsoft-intune#smime-scenarios) and [Configuration keys - S/MIME settings](https://docs.microsoft.com/exchange/clients-and-mobile-in-exchange-online/outlook-for-ios-and-android/outlook-for-ios-and-android-configuration-with-microsoft-intune#smime-settings). 

<!-- vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv -->

<!-- vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv -->
### Device enrollment

#### Corporate-owned, personally enabled devices (preview)<!--4442275  -->
Intune now supports Android Enterprise corporate-owned devices with a work profile for OS versions Android 8 and above. Corporate-owned devices with a work profile is one of the corporate management scenarios in the Android Enterprise solution set. This scenario is for single user devices intended for corporate and personal use. This corporate-owned, personally-enabled (COPE) scenario offers:

- work and personal profile containerization
- device-level control for admins
- a guarantee for end users that their personal data and applications will remain private

The first public preview release will include a subset of the features that will be included in the generally available release. Additional features will be added on a rolling basis. The features that will be available in the first preview include:

- Enrollment: Admins can create multiple enrollment profiles with unique tokens that do not expire. Device enrollment can be done through NFC, token entry, QR code, Zero Touch, or Knox Mobile Enrollment.
- Device configuration: A subset of the existing fully managed and dedicated device settings.
- Device compliance: The compliance policies that are currently available for fully managed devices.
- Device Actions: Delete device (factory reset), reboot device, and lock device.  
- App management: App assignments, app configuration, and the associated reporting capabilities 
- Conditional Access

For more information about corporate-owned with work profile preview, see the [support blog](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/intune-customer-success/microsoft-announces-public-preview-for-android-enterprise/ba-p/1524325).

<!-- vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv -->
### Device management

#### Updates to the remote lock action for macOS devices<!--7032805   -->
Changes to the remote lock action for macOS devices include:
- The recovery pin is displayed for 30 days before deletion (instead of 7 days).
- If an admin has a second browser open and tries to trigger the command again from a different tab or browser, Intune lets the command to go through. But the reporting status is set to failed rather than generating a new pin.
- The admin isn't allowed to issue another remote lock command if the previous command is still pending or if the device hasn’t checked back in.
These changes are designed to prevent the correct pin from being overwritten after multiple remote lock commands.

#### Device actions report differentiates between wipe and protected wipe<!--7118901 -->
The **Device actions** report now differentiates between the wipe and protected wipe actions. To see the report, go to [Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431) > **Devices** > **Monitor** > **Device Actions** (under **Other**).

<!-- vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv -->
### Device security

#### Microsoft Defender Firewall rule migration tool preview<!-- 6423187   -->
As a public preview, we're working on a PowerShell based tool that will migrate Microsoft Defender Firewall rules. When you install and run the tool, it automatically creates endpoint security firewall rule policies for Intune that are based on the current configuration of a Windows 10 client. For more information, see [Endpoint security firewall rule migration tool overview](../protect/endpoint-security-firewall-rule-tool.md).

#### Endpoint detection and response policy for onboarding Tenant Attached devices to MDATP is Generally Available<!-- 7303816   -->
As part of endpoint security in Intune, the [Endpoint detection and response (EDR) policies for use with devices managed by Configuration Manager](../protect/endpoint-security-edr-policy.md) are no longer in *preview* and are  now *Generally Available*.

To use EDR policy with devices from a supported version of Configuration Manager, configure [Tenant attach for Configuration Manager](../../configmgr/tenant-attach/device-sync-actions.md). After you complete the tenant attach configuration, you can deploy EDR policies to onboard devices managed by Configuration Manager to Microsoft Defender Advanced Threat Protection (Microsoft Defender ATP).

#### Bluetooth settings are available in Device Control profiles for Endpoint security Attack surface reduction policy <!--7032084   -->
We've added settings to manage Bluetooth on Windows 10 devices to the [Device control profile](../protect/endpoint-security-asr-profile-settings.md#device-control-profile) for *Endpoint security Attack surface Reduction policy*.  These are the same settings as those that have been available in Device restriction profiles for *Device configuration*.

#### Manage source locations for definition updates with endpoint security antivirus policy for Windows 10 devices<!-- 6347801   -->  
We've added two new settings to the *Updates* category of [endpoint security antivirus policy for Windows 10 devices](../protect/antivirus-microsoft-defender-settings-windows.md#updates)  that can help you manage how devices get update definitions:

- *Define file shares for downloading definition updates*
- *Define the order of sources for downloading definition updates*

With the new settings you can add UNC file shares as download source locations for definition updates, and define the order in which different source locations are contacted.

#### Improved security baselines node<!-- 7433136    -->
We've made some changes to improve the usability of the [security baseline node](../protect/security-baselines.md) in the Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center. Now when you drill in to **Endpoint security** > **Security baselines** and then select a security baseline type like the MDM Security Baseline, your presented with the **Profiles** pane. On the Profiles pane you view the profiles you've created for that Baseline type.  Previously the console presented an Overview pane which included an aggregate data roll up that didn't always match the details found in the reports for individual profiles.

Unchanged, from the Profiles pane you can select a profile to drill-in to view that profiles properties as well as various reports that are available under *Monitor*.  Similarly, at the same level as Profiles you can still select **Versions** to view a the various versions of that profile type that you've deployed. When you drill-in to a version, you also gain access to reports, similar to the profile reports. 

#### Derived credentials support for Windows<!-- 4886090   -->
You can now use derived credentials with your Windows devices. This will  expand on the existing support for iOS/iPadOS and Android, and will be available for the same derived credential providers:
- Entrust Datacard
- Intercede
- DISA Purebred

Support for Widows includes use of a derived credential to authenticate to Wi-Fi or VPN profiles. For Windows devices, the derived credential is issued from the client app that's provided by the derived credential provider that you use.

#### Manage FileVault encryption for devices that were encrypted by the device user and not by Intune<!--5239424  -->
Intune can now [assume management of FileVault disk encryption on a macOS device that was encrypted by the device user](../protect/encrypt-devices-filevault.md#assume-management-of-filevault-on-previously-encrypted-devices), and not by Intune policy.  This scenario requires:
- The device to receive disk encryption policy from Intune that enables FileVault.
- The device user to use the Company Portal website to upload their personal recovery key for the encrypted device to Intune. To upload the key, they select the *Store recovery key* option for their encrypted macOS device.

After the user uploads their recovery key, Intune rotates the key to confirm it is valid. Intune can now manage the key and encryption as if it used policy to encrypt the device directly. Should a user need to recover their device, they can access the recovery key using any device from the following locations:   
- Company Portal website
- Company Portal app for iOS/iPadOS 
- Company Portal app for Android
- Intune app

#### Hide the personal recovery key from a device user during macOS FileVault disk encryption<!--  5475632-->
When you use endpoint security policy to configure macOS FileVault disk encryption, use the [**Hide recovery key**](../protect/endpoint-security-disk-encryption-profile-settings.md#filevault) setting to prevent display of the *personal recovery key* to the device user, while the device is being encrypted. By hiding the key during encryption, you can help keep it secure as users won’t be able to write it down while waiting for the device to encrypt. 

Later, if recovery is needed, a user can always use any device to view their personal recovery key through the Intune Company Portal website, the iOS/iPadOS Company Portal, the Android Company Portal, or the Intune app.

#### Improved view of security baseline details for devices<!-- 5536846  -->
You can now drill-in to the details for a device to view the settings details for security baselines that apply to the device. The settings appear in a simple, flat list, which includes the setting category, setting name, and status. For more information, see [View Endpoint security configurations per device](../protect/security-baselines-monitor.md#view-endpoint-security-configurations-per-device).

<!-- vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv -->
### Monitor and troubleshoot

#### Device compliance logs now in English<!--6014904  -->
The Intune DeviceComplianceOrg logs previously only had enumerations for ComplianceState, OwnerType, and DeviceHealthThreatLevel. Now, these logs have English information in the columns.


<!-- vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv -->
### Role-based access control

#### Assign profile and Update profile permission changes<!--7177586 idready wnready wnstaged-->
Role-based access control permissions has changed for Assign profile and Update profile for the Automated Device Enrollment flow:

Assign profile: Admins with this permission can also assign the profiles to tokens and assign a default profile to a token for Automated Device Enrollment.

Update profile: Admins with this permission can update existing profiles only for Automated Device Enrollment.

To see these roles, go to [Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431) > **Tenant administration** > **Roles** > **All roles** > **Create** > **Permissions** > **Roles**.

<!-- vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv -->
### Scripting

#### Additional Data Warehouse v1.0 properties<!-- 6125732 wnready -->
Additional properties are available using the Intune Data Warehouse v1.0. The following properties are now exposed via the [devices](../developer/reports-ref-devices.md#devices) entity:
- `ethernetMacAddress` -  The unique network identifier of this device.
- `office365Version` - The version of Office 365 that is installed on the device.

#### Use Autonomous Single App Mode settings to configure the iOS Company Portal app to be a sign in/sign out app<!-- 7055619   -->
On iOS/iPadOS devices, you can configure apps to run in autonomous single app mode (ASAM). Now, the Company Portal app supports ASAM, and can be configured to be a "sign in/sign out" app. In this mode, users must sign in to the Company Portal app to use other apps and the Home screen button on the device. When they sign out of the Company Portal app, the device returns to single app mode, and locks on the Company Portal app.

To configure the Company Portal to be in ASAM, go to **Devices** > **Configuration profiles** > **Create profile** > **iOS/iPadOS** for platform > **Device restrictions** for profile > **Autonomous Single App Mode**.

For more information, see [Autonomous single app mode (ASAM)](../configuration/device-restrictions-ios.md#autonomous-single-app-mode-asam) and [single app mode](https://support.apple.com/guide/mdm/single-app-mode-mdm80a981/1/web/1) (opens Apple's web site).

Applies to:
- iOS/iPadOS

#### Configure content caching on macOS devices<!-- 7106872   -->
On macOS devices, you can create a configuration profile that configures content caching (**Devices** > **Configuration profiles** > **Create profile** > **macOS** for platform > **Device features** for profile). Use these settings to delete cache, allow shared cache, set a cache limit on the disk, and more.

For more information on content caching, see [ContentCaching](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/devicemanagement/contentcaching) (opens Apple's web site).

To see the settings you can configure, go to [macOS device feature settings in Intune](../configuration/macos-device-features-settings.md).

### Device enrollment

#### Bring-your-own-devices can use VPN to deploy<!--5015344  -->
The new  Autopilot profile **Skip Domain Connectivity Check** toggle lets you deploy Hybrid Azure AD Join devices without access to your corporate network using your own 3rd party Win32 VPN client. To see the new toggle, go to [Microsoft Endpoint Manager Admin Center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431) > **Devices**  > **Windows** > **Windows enrollment** > **Deployment profiles** > **Create profile** > **Out-of-box experience (OOBE)**.

#### Enrollment Status Page profiles can be set to device groups<!--3952138 -->
Previously, Enrollment Status Page (ESP) profiles could only be targeted to user groups. Now you can also set them to target device groups. For more information, see [Set up an Enrollment Status Page](../enrollment/windows-enrollment-status.md).

#### Automated Device Enrollment sync errors<!-- 6988214 -->
New errors will be reported for iOS/iPadOS and macOS devices, including
- Invalid characters in the phone number or if that field is empty. 
- Invalid or empty configuration name for the profile. 
- Invalid/expired cursor value or if no cursor is found.
- Rejected or expired token. 
- The department field is empty or the length is too long. 
- Profile is not found by Apple and a new one needs to be created. 
- A count of removed Apple Business Manager devices will be added to the overview page where you see the status of your devices.

#### Shared iPads for Business<!--6367326   -->
You can use Intune and Apple Business Manager to easily and securely set up Shared iPad so that multiple employees can share devices. Apple's [Shared iPad](https://developer.apple.com/education/shared-ipad/) provides a personalized experience for multiple users while preserving user data. Using a Managed Apple ID, users can access their apps, data, and settings after signing into any Shared iPad in their organization. Shared iPad works with federated identities.

To see this feature, go to [Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431) > **Devices** > **iOS** > **iOS enrollment** > **Enrollment program tokens** > choose a token** > **Profiles** > **Create profile** > **iOS**. On the **Management Settings** page, select **Enroll without User Affinity** and you'll see the **Shared iPad** option.

Requires: iPadOS 13.4 and later. This release added support for temporary sessions with Shared iPad so that users can access a device without a Managed Apple ID. Upon logout, the device erases all user data so that the device is immediately ready for use, eliminating the need for a device wipe. 

#### Updated user interface for Apple's Automated Device Enrollment<!--7430322 -->
The user interface has been updated to replace Apple's Device Enrollment Program to Automated Device Enrollment to reflect Apple terminology.

### Device management

#### Device remote lock pin available for macOS<!--7281557   -->
The availability for macOS device remote lock pins has been increased from 7 days to 30 days.

#### Change primary user on co-managed devices<!--7319183  -->
You can change a device's primary user for co-managed Windows devices. For more information on how to find and change it, see [Find the primary user of an Intune device](../remote-actions/find-primary-user.md). This feature will be rolling out gradually over the next few weeks.

#### Setting the Intune primary user also sets the Azure AD owner property<!--7319227 -->
This new feature automatically sets the owner property on newly-enrolled Hybrid Azure AD joined devices at the same time that the Intune primary user is set. For more information on the primary user, see [Find the primary user of an Intune device](../remote-actions/find-primary-user.md).

This is a change to the enrollment process and only applies to newly enrolled devices. For existing Hybrid Azure AD Joined devices, you must manually update the Azure AD Owner property. To do this, you can use the [Change primary user feature](../remote-actions/find-primary-user.md#change-a-devices-primary-user) or [a script](https://github.com/microsoftgraph/powershell-intune-samples/tree/master/ManagedDevices).

When Windows 10 devices become Hybrid Azure Azure Directory Joined, the first user of the device becomes the primary user in Endpoint Manager.  Currently, the user isn't set on the corresponding Azure AD device object. This causes an inconsistency when comparing the *owner* property from an Azure AD portal with the *primary user* property in Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center. The Azure AD owner property is used for securing access to BitLocker recovery keys. The property isn't populated on Hybrid Azure AD Joined devices. This limitation prevents set up of self-service of BitLocker recovery from Azure AD. This upcoming feature solves this limitation.


<!-- vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv -->
### Device security

#### Hide the recovery key from users during FileVault 2 encryption for macOS devices<!-- 5459801  -->
We've added a new setting to the *FileVault* category within the [macOS Endpoint Protection](../protect/endpoint-protection-macos.md#filevault) template: **Hide recovery key**. This setting hides the personal key from the end user during FileVault 2 encryption. 

To view the personal recovery key of an encrypted macOS device, the device user can go to any of the following locations and click on *get recovery key* for the macOS device: 

- The iOS/iPadOS company portal app
- The Intune app
- The company portal website
- The Android company portal app

#### Support for S/MIME signing and encryption certificates with Outlook on Android Fully Managed<!--5896415   -->
You can now use certificates for S/MIME signing and encryption with Outlook on devices that run Android Enterprise Fully Managed.

This expands on the support added last month for other Android versions (Support for S/MIME signing and encryption certificates with Outlook on Android). You can provision these certificates by using SCEP and PKCS imported certificate profiles.

For more information about this support, see [Sensitivity labeling and protection in Outlook for iOS and Android](https://docs.microsoft.com/exchange/clients-and-mobile-in-exchange-online/outlook-for-ios-and-android/sensitive-labeling-and-protection-outlook-for-ios-android) in the Exchange documentation.

#### Add a link to your company portal support website to emails for noncompliance<!-- 7225498    -->
When you [configure a notification message template](../protect/actions-for-noncompliance.md#create-a-notification-message-template) for sending email notifications for noncompliance, use the new setting **Company Portal Website Link** to automatically include a link to your Company Portal website. With this option set to *Enable*, users with noncompliant devices who receive email based on this template can use the link to open a website to learn more about why their device isn’t compliant. 

<!-- vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv -->
### Licensing

#### Admins no longer require an Intune license to access Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin console<!--1335430 -->
You can now set a tenant-wide toggle that removes the Intune license requirement for admins to access the MEM admin console and query graph APIs. Once you remove the license requirement, you can never reinstate it.

For more information, see [Deploy multiple OEMConfig profiles to Zebra devices in Microsoft Intune](../configuration/oemconfig-zebra-android-devices.md).

There is no change in OEMConfig behavior for other OEMs.

Applies to:
- Android Enterprise
- Zebra Technologies devices that support OEMConfig. For specific details on support, contact Zebra.

#### Configure system extensions on macOS devices<!-- 6255624 -->
On macOS devices, you can create a kernel extensions profile to configure settings at the kernel-level (**Devices** > **Configuration profiles** > **macOS** for platform > **Kernel extensions** for profile). Apple is eventually deprecating kernel extensions, and replacing them with system extensions in a future release.

System extensions run in the user space, and don’t have access to the kernel. The goal is to increase security and provide more end user control, while limiting attacks at the kernel level. Both kernel extensions and system extensions allow users to install app extensions that extend the native capabilities of the operating system.

In Intune, you can configure both kernel extensions and system extensions (**Devices** > **Configuration profiles** > **macOS** for platform > **System extensions** for profile). Kernel extensions apply to 10.13.2 and newer. System extensions apply to 10.15 and newer. From macOS 10.15 to macOS 10.15.4, kernel extensions and system extensions can run side-by-side. 

To learn about these extensions on macOS devices, see [Add macOS extensions](../configuration/kernel-extensions-overview-macos.md).

Applies to:
- macOS 10.15 and newer

#### Configure app and process privacy preferences on macOS devices<!-- 2934232   --> 
With the release of macOS Catalina 10.15, Apple added new security and privacy enhancements. By default, applications and processes are unable to access specific data without user consent. If users don't provide consent, the applications and processes may fail to function. Intune is adding support for settings that enable IT administrators to allow or disallow data access consent on behalf of end-users on devices running macOS 10.14 and later. These settings will ensure that applications and processes continue to function properly, and reduce the number of prompts. 

For more information on the settings you can manage, see [macOS privacy preferences](../configuration/device-restrictions-macos.md#privacy-preferences).

Applies to:
- macOS 10.14 and newer

- Configure security baselines
- Manage device compliance and conditional access policies
- View compliance status for all your devices from both Intune and Configuration Manager when Configuration Manager is configured for client attach.

In addition to the availability of content, the following are new for Endpoint Security this month:

- [**Endpoint security policies**](../protect/endpoint-security-policy.md) **are out of** ***preview*** and are now ready to use in production environments, as *generally available*, with two exceptions:

  - In a new *public preview*, you can use the [**Microsoft Defender Firewall rules** profile](../protect/endpoint-security-firewall-policy.md#firewall-profiles) for Windows 10 Firewall policy. With each instance of this profile you can configure up to 150 firewall rules to compliment your Microsoft Defender Firewall profiles. 
  - Account protection security policy remains in preview. 

- You can now [**create a duplicate of endpoint security policies**](../protect/endpoint-security-policy.md#duplicate-a-policy). Duplicates keep the settings configuration of the original policy, but get a new name. Then new policy instance doesn't include any assignments to groups until you edit the new policy instance to add them. You can duplicate the following policies:
  - Antivirus
  - Disk encryption
  - Firewall
  - Endpoint detection and response
  - Attack surface reduction
  - Account protection

- You can now [**create a duplicate of a security baseline**](../protect/security-baselines.md#duplicate-a-security-baseline). Duplicates keep the settings configuration of the original baseline, but get a new name. The new baseline instance doesn't include any assignments to groups until you edit the new baseline instance to add them.

- A new report for endpoint security antivirus policy is available: [**Windows 10 unhealthy endpoints**](../protect/endpoint-security-antivirus-policy.md#windows-10-unhealthy-endpoints). This report is a new page you can select when your viewing your endpoint security antivirus policy. The report displays the antivirus status of your MDM-managed Windows 10 devices.  

#### Support for S/MIME signing and encryption certificates with Outlook on Android<!-- 7207474  -->

Users who are assigned Microsoft Office for macOS in Microsoft Endpoint Manager will now receive Microsoft Teams in addition to the existing Microsoft Office apps (Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, and OneNote). Intune will recognize the existing Mac devices that have the other Office for macOS apps installed, and will attempt to install Microsoft Teams the next time the device checks in with Intune. In the [Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431), you can find the **Office 365 Suite** for macOS by selecting **Apps** > **macOS** > **Add**. For more information, see [Assign Office 365 to macOS devices with Microsoft Intune](../apps/apps-add-office365-macos.md).

#### Update to Android app configuration policies<!-- 6113334  -->
Android app configuration policies have been updated to allow admins to select the device enrollment type before creating an app config profile. The functionality is being added to account for certificate profiles that are based on enrollment type (Work profile or Device Owner).  This update provides the following:

1. If a new profile is created and Work Profile and Device Owner Profile are selected for device enrollment type, you will not be able to associate a certificate profile with the app config policy.
2. If a new profile is created and Work Profile only is selected, Work Profile certificate policies created under Device Configuration can be utilized.
3. If a new profile is created and Device Owner only is selected, Device Owner certificate policies created under Device Configuration can be utilized. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Existing policies created prior to the release of this feature (April 2020 release - 2004) that do not have any certificate profiles associated with the policy will default to Work Profile and Device Owner Profile for device enrollment type. Also, existing policies created prior to the release of this feature that have certificate profiles associated with them will default to Work Profile only.

Additionally, we are adding Gmail and Nine email configuration profiles that will work for both Work Profile and Device Owner enrollment types, including the use of certificate profiles on both email configuration types.  Any Gmail or Nine policies that you have created under Device Configuration for Work Profiles will continue to apply to the device and it is not necessary to move them to app configuration policies.

In the [Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431), you can find app configuration policies by selecting **Apps** > **App configuration policies**. For more information about app configuration policies, see [App configuration policies for Microsoft Intune](../apps/app-configuration-policies-overview.md).

#### Push notification when device ownership type is changed<!-- 5575875 -->
You can configure a push notification to send to both your Android and iOS Company Portal users when their device ownership type has been changed from Personal to Corporate as a privacy courtesy. This push notification is set to off by default. The setting can be found in the Microsoft Endpoint Manager by selecting **Tenant administration** > **Customization**. To learn more about how device ownership affects your end-users, see [Change device ownership](../enrollment/corporate-identifiers-add.md#change-device-ownership).

#### Group targeting support for Customization pane<!-- 4722837  -->
You can target the settings in the **Customization** pane to user groups. To find these settings in Intune, navigate to the [Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431), select **Tenant administration** > **Customization**. For more information about customization, see [How to customize the Intune Company Portal apps, Company Portal website, and Intune app](../apps/company-portal-app.md).

### Device configuration

#### Multiple "Evaluate each connection attempt" on-demand VPN rules supported on iOS, iPadOS, and macOS<!-- 6424615  -->
The Intune user experience allows multiple on-demand VPN rules in the same VPN profile with the **Evaluate each connection attempt** action (**Devices** > **Configuration profiles** > **Create profile** > **iOS/iPadOS** or **macOS** for platform > **VPN** for profile > **Automatic VPN** > **On-demand**).

It only honored the first rule in the list. This behavior is fixed, and Intune evaluates all rules in the list. Each rule is evaluated in the order it appears in the on-demand rules list.

> [!NOTE]
> If you have existing VPN profiles that use these on-demand VPN rules, the fix applies the next time you change the VPN profile. For example, make a minor change, such as change the connection the name, and then save the profile.
>
> If you're using SCEP certificates for authentication, this change causes the certificates for this VPN profile to be re-issued.

Applies to:
- iOS/iPadOS
- macOS

For more information on VPN profiles, see [Create VPN profiles](../configuration/vpn-settings-configure.md).

#### Additional options in SSO and SSO app extension profiles on iOS/iPadOS devices<!-- 6504155   -->

On iOS/iPadOS devices, you can:
- In SSO profiles (**Devices** > **Configuration profiles** > **Create profile** > **iOS/iPadOS** for platform > **Device features** for profile > **Single sign-on**), set the Kerberos principal name to be the Security Account Manager (SAM) account name in SSO profiles. 
- In SSO app extension profiles (**Devices** > **Configuration profiles** > **Create profile** > **iOS/iPadOS** for platform > **Device features** for profile > **Single sign-on app extension**), configure the iOS/iPadOS Microsoft Azure AD extension with fewer clicks by using a new SSO app extension type. You can enable the Azure AD extension for devices in shared device mode and send extension-specific data to the extension.

Applies to:
- iOS/iPadOS 13.0+

For more information on using single sign-on on iOS/iPadOS devices, see [Single sign-on app extension overview](../configuration/device-features-configure.md#single-sign-on-app-extension) and [Single sign-on settings list](../configuration/ios-device-features-settings.md#single-sign-on-app-extension).

<!-- vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv -->
### Device enrollment

#### Delete Apple Automated Device Enrollment token when default profile is present<!--6393220 -->
Previously, you couldn't delete a default profile, which meant that you couldn't delete the Automated Device Enrollment token associated with it. Now, you can delete the token when:
- no devices are assigned to the token
- a default profile is present
To do so, delete the default profile and then delete the associated token.
For more information, see [Delete an ADE token from Intune](../enrollment/device-enrollment-program-enroll-ios.md#delete-an-automated-device-enrollment-token-from-intune).

#### Scaled up support for Apple Automated Device Enrollment and Apple Configurator 2 devices, profiles, and tokens<!--3542402 -->
To help distributed IT departments and organizations, Intune now supports up to 1000 enrollment profiles per token, 2000 Automated Device Enrollment (formerly known as DEP) tokens per Intune account, and 75,000 devices per token. There is no specific limit for devices per enrollment profile, below the maximum number of devices per token.

Intune now supports up to 1000 Apple Configurator 2 profiles.

For more information, see [Supported volume](../enrollment/device-enrollment-program-enroll-ios.md#supported-volume).

#### All devices page column entry changes<!--6967616 -->
On the **All devices** page, the entries for the **Managed by** column have changed:
- *Intune* is now displayed instead of *MDM*
- *Co-managed* is now displayed instead of *MDM/ConfigMgr Agent*

The export values are unchanged.

<!-- vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv -->
### Security

#### Derived credentials to provision Android Enterprise Fully Managed devices with certificates<!--4839592    -->
Intune now supports use of [derived credentials](../protect/derived-credentials.md) as an authentication method for Android devices. Derived credentials are an implementation of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) 800-157 standard for deploying certificates to devices. Our support for Android expands on our support for devices that run iOS/iPadOS.

Derived credentials rely on the use of a Personal Identity Verification (PIV) or Common Access Card (CAC) card, like a smart card. To get a derived credential for their mobile device, users start in the Microsoft Intune app and follow an enrollment workflow that is unique to the provider you use. Common to all providers is the requirement to use a smart card on a computer to authenticate to the derived credential provider. That provider then issues a certificate to the device that's derived from the user's smart card.

You can use derived credentials as the authentication method for device configuration profiles for VPN and WiFi. You can also use them for app authentication, and S/MIME signing and encryption for applications that support it.

Intune now supports the following derived credential providers with Android:
- Entrust Datacard
- Intercede

A third provider, DISA Purebred, will be available for Android in a future release.

#### Microsoft Edge security baseline is now Generally Available<!--6586139 -->

A new version of the [Microsoft Edge security baseline](../protect/security-baselines.md#available-security-baselines) is now available, and is released as generally available (GA). The previous Edge baseline was in Preview.  The new baseline version ins April 2020 (Edge version 80 and later). 

With the release of this new baseline, you'll no longer be able to create profiles based on the previous baseline versions, but you can continue to use profiles you created with those versions. You can also choose to [update your existing profiles to use the latest baseline version](../protect/security-baselines.md#change-the-baseline-version-for-a-profile).

### App management

#### macOS and iOS Company Portal updates<!-- 5779439, 5780234  -->
The Profile pane of the macOS and iOS Company Portal has been updated to include the sign-out button. Additionally, UI improvements have been made to the Profile pane in the macOS Company Portal. For more information about the Company Portal, see [How to configure the Microsoft Intune Company Portal app](../apps/company-portal-app.md).

#### Retarget web clips to Microsoft Edge on iOS devices<!-- 5455276   -->
Newly deployed web clips (pinned web apps) on iOS devices that are required to open in a protected browser, will open in Microsoft Edge rather than the Intune Managed Browser. You must retarget pre-existing web clips to ensure they open in Microsoft Edge rather than the Managed Browser. For more information, see [Manage web access by using Microsoft Edge with Microsoft Intune](../apps/manage-microsoft-edge.md) and [Add web apps to Microsoft Intune](../apps/web-app.md).

#### Use the Intune diagnostic tool with Microsoft Edge for Android<!-- 4735244  -->
Microsoft Edge for Android is now integrated with the Intune diagnostic tool. Similarly to the experience on Microsoft Edge for iOS, entering "about:intunehelp" into the URL bar (the address box) of Microsoft Edge on the device will start the Intune diagnostic tool. This tool will provide detailed logs. Users can be guided to collect and send these logs to their IT department, or view MAM logs for specific apps.

#### Updates to Intune branding and customization<!-- 5236032  -->
We have updated the Intune pane that was named "Branding and customization" with improvements, including:

- Renaming the pane to **Customization**.
- Improving the organization and design of the settings.
- Improving the settings text and tooltips.

To find these settings in Intune, navigate to the [Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431), select **Tenant administration** > **Customization**. For information about existing customization, see [How to configure the Microsoft Intune Company Portal app](../apps/company-portal-app.md).

#### User's personal encrypted recovery key<!-- 6273943  -->
A new Intune feature is available that enables users to retrieve their personal encrypted **FileVault** recovery key for Mac devices through the Android Company Portal application or through the Android Intune application. There is a link in both the Company Portal application and Intune application that will open a Chrome browser to the Web Company Portal where the user can see the **FileVault** recovery key needed to access their Mac devices. For more information about encryption, see [Use device Encryption with Intune](../protect/encrypt-devices.md).

#### Optimized dedicated device enrollment <!-- 6114580  -->
We're optimizing the enrollment for Android Enterprise dedicated devices and making it easier for SCEP certificates associated with Wi-Fi to apply to dedicated devices enrolled prior to November 22, 2019. For new enrollments, the Intune app will continue to install, but end-users will no longer need to perform the **Enable Intune Agent** step during enrollment. Installment will happen in the background automatically and SCEP certificates associated with Wi-Fi can be deployed and set without end-user interaction.  

These changes will be rolling out on a phased basis throughout the month of March as the Intune service backend deploys. All tenants will have this new behavior by the end of March. For related information, see [Support for SCEP certificates in Android Enterprise dedicated devices](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/intune-customer-success/support-for-scep-certificates-in-android-enterprise-dedicated/ba-p/928147).

### Device configuration

#### New user experience when creating administrative templates on Windows devices<!--5096036 -->
Based on customer feedback, and our move to the new Azure full screen experience, we've rebuilt the Administrative Templates profile experience with a folder view. We haven't made changes to any settings or existing profiles. So, your existing profiles will stay the same, and will be usable in the new view. You can still navigate all settings options by selecting **All Settings**, and using search. The tree view is split by Computer and User configurations. You will find Windows, Office, and Edge settings in their associated folders.  

Applies to:
- Windows 10 and newer

#### VPN profiles with IKEv2 VPN connections can use always on with iOS/iPadOS devices<!-- 1947932   -->
On iOS/iPadOS devices, you can create a VPN profile that uses an IKEv2 connection (**Devices** > **Configuration profiles** > **Create profile** > **iOS/iPadOS** for platform > **VPN** for profile type). Now, you can configure always-on with IKEv2. When configured, IKEv2 VPN profiles connect automatically, and stay connected (or quickly reconnect) to the VPN. It stays connected even when moving between networks or restarting devices.

On iOS/iPadOS, always-on VPN is limited to IKEv2 profiles.

To see the IKEv2 settings you can configure, go to [Add VPN settings on iOS devices in Microsoft Intune](../configuration/vpn-settings-ios.md#ikev2-settings).

Applies to:
- iOS/iPadOS

#### Delete bundles and bundle arrays in OEMConfig device configuration profiles on Android Enterprise devices<!-- 5550355   -->
On Android Enterprise devices, you create and update OEMConfig profiles (**Devices** > **Configuration profiles** > **Create profile** > **Android Enterprise** for platform > **OEMConfig** for profile type). Users can now delete bundles and bundle arrays using the **Configuration designer** in Intune.

For more information on OEMConfig profiles, see [Use and manage Android Enterprise devices with OEMConfig in Microsoft Intune](../configuration/android-oem-configuration-overview.md).

####  UI update when configuring compliance policy<!-- 3961639    -->

We've updated the UI for [creating compliance policies](../protect/create-compliance-policy.md#create-the-policy) in Microsoft Endpoint manager (**Devices** > **Compliance policies** > **Policies** > **Create Policy**). We've a new user experience that includes the same settings and details you've used previously. The new experience follows a wizard-like process to create the compliance policy and includes a page where you can add *Assignments* for the policy, and a *Review + Create* page where you can review your configuration before creating the policy.

#### Retire noncompliant devices<!-- 1827291       -->
We've added a new action for noncompliant devices that you can add to any policy, to  [retire the noncompliant device](../protect/actions-for-noncompliance.md#add-actions-for-noncompliance).  The new action, **Retire the noncompliant device**, results in removal of all company data from the device, and also removes the device from being managed by Intune.  This action runs when the configured value in days is reached and at that point the device becomes eligible to be retired. The minimum value is 30 days.  Explicit IT admin approval will be required to retire the devices by using  the *Retire Non-compliant devices* section, where admins can retire all eligible devices.

#### Support for WPA and WPA2 in iOS Enterprise Wi-Fi profiles<!--6215273   -->
[Enterprise Wi-Fi profiles for iOS](../configuration/wi-fi-settings-ios.md#enterprise-profiles) now support the *Security type* field. For *Security type*, you can select either of **WPA Enterprise** or **WPA/WPA2 Enterprise**, and then specify a selection for the *EAP type*.  (**Devices** > **Configuration profiles** > **Create profile** and select **iOS/iPadOS** for *Platform* and then **Wi-Fi** for *Profile*). 

The new Enterprise options are like those that have been available for a Basic Wi-Fi profile for iOS.

#### New user experience for certificate, email, VPN, and Wi-Fi, VPN profiles<!-- 5615208   -->
We've updated the [user experience](../configuration/device-profile-create.md) in the Endpoint Management Admin Center (**Devices** > **Configuration profiles** > **Create profile**) for creating and modifying the following profile types. The new experience presents the same settings as before, but uses a wizard-like experience that doesn't require as much horizontal scrolling. You won't need to modify existing configurations with the new experience.

- Derived credential
- Email
- PKCS certificate
- PKCS imported certificate
- SCEP certificate
- Trusted certificate
- VPN
- Wi-Fi

<!-- vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv -->
### Device management

#### New Android report on Android Devices overview page<!-- 5435435   -->
We've added a report to the Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin console in the Android Devices overview page that displays how many Android devices have been enrolled in each device management solution. This chart (like the same chart already in the Azure console) shows work profile, fully managed, dedicated, and device administrator enrolled device counts. To see the report, choose **Devices** > **Android** > **Overview**.

#### Guide users from Android device administrator management to work profile management<!--5857738   -->
We're releasing a new compliance setting for the Android device administrator platform. This setting lets you make a device non-compliant if it's managed with device administrator.

On these non-compliant devices, on the **Update device settings** page users will see the **Move to new device management setup** message. If they tap the **Resolve** button, they'll be guided through:

1. Unenrolling from device administrator management
2. Enrolling in work profile management
3. Resolving compliance issues 
 
Google is decreasing device administrator support in new Android releases in an effort to move to modern, richer, and more secure device management with Android Enterprise.  Intune can only provide full support for device administrator-managed Android devices running Android 10 and later through Q2 CY2020. Device administrator-managed devices (except Samsung) that are running Android 10 or later after this time won't be able to be entirely managed. In particular, impacted devices won't receive new password requirements.

For more information about this setting, see [Move Android devices from device administrator to work profile management](../enrollment/android-move-device-admin-work-profile.md). 

<!-- vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv -->
### Monitor and troubleshoot

#### The Data Warehouse now provides the MAC address<!-- 6123680  -->
The Intune Data Warehouse provides the MAC address as a new property (`EthernetMacAddress`) in the `device` entity to allow admins to correlate between the user and host mac address. This property helps to reach specific users and troubleshoot incidents occurring on the network. Admins can also use this property in [Power BI reports](../developer/reports-proc-get-a-link-powerbi.md) to build richer reports. For more information, see the Intune Data Warehouse [device](../developer/intune-data-warehouse-collections.md#devices) entity.

#### Additional Data Warehouse device inventory properties<!-- 6125732  -->
Additional device inventory properties are available using the Intune Data Warehouse. The following properties are now exposed via the [devices](../developer/reports-ref-devices.md#devices) beta collection:
- `ethernetMacAddress` -  The unique network identifier of this device.
- `model` - The device model.
- `office365Version` - The version of Office 365 that is installed on the device.
- `windowsOsEdition` - The Operating System version.

The following properties are now exposed via the [devicePropertyHistory](../developer/reports-ref-devices.md#devicepropertyhistories) beta collection:
- `physicalMemoryInBytes` - The physical memory in bytes.
- `totalStorageSpaceInBytes` - Total storage capacity in bytes.

For more information, see [Microsoft Intune Data Warehouse API](../developer/reports-nav-intune-data-warehouse.md).

#### Help and support workflow update to support additional services<!-- 5654170   -->
We've updated the Help and support page in the Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center where you now [choose the management type you use](../fundamentals/get-support.md#options-to-access-help-and-support). With this change you'll be able to select from the following management types:

- Configuration Manager (includes Desktop Analytics)
- Intune
- Co-management

<!-- vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv -->
### Security

#### Use a preview of security administrator focused policies as part of Endpoint security<!--6131401  -->
As a public preview, we've added several new policy groups under the Endpoint security node in the Microsoft Endpoint Management admin center. As a security admin you can use these new policies to focus on specific aspects of device security to manage discrete groups of related settings without the overhead of the larger Device Configuration policy body.

With the exception of the new *Antivirus policy for Microsoft Defender Antivirus* (see below), the settings in each new of these new preview policies and profiles are the same settings that you might already configure through [Device configuration profiles](../configuration/device-profile-create.md) today.

The following are the new policy types that are all in preview, and their available profile types:

- **Antivirus (Preview)**:
  - macOS:
    - **Antivirus** - Manage [Antivirus policy settings](../protect/antivirus-microsoft-defender-settings-macos.md) for macOS to manage [Microsoft Defender ATP for Mac](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/security/threat-protection/microsoft-defender-atp/microsoft-defender-atp-mac).

  - Windows 10 and later:
    - **Microsoft Defender Antivirus** - Manage [Antivirus policy settings](../protect/antivirus-microsoft-defender-settings-windows.md) for cloud protection, Antivirus exclusions, remediation, scan options, and more.

      The Antivirus profile for *Microsoft Defender Antivirus* is an exception that introduces a new instance of settings that are found as part of a device restriction profile. These new Antivirus settings:

        - Are the same settings as found in device restrictions, but support a third option for configuration that's not available when configured as a device restriction.
        - Apply to devices that are co-managed with Configuration Manager, when the [co-management workload slider](https://docs.microsoft.com/configmgr/comanage/how-to-switch-workloads) for Endpoint Protection is set to Intune.

     Plan to use the new *Antivirus* > *Microsoft Defender Antivirus* profile in place of configuring them through a device restriction profile.

  - **Windows Security experience** - Manage the Windows Security settings that end users can view in the Microsoft Defender Security center and the notifications they receive. These settings are unchanged from those available as a Device configuration Endpoint Protection profile.

- **Disk encryption (Preview)**:
  - macOS:
    - **FileVault**
  - Windows 10 and later:
    - **BitLocker**
- **Firewall (Preview)**:

### Device security

#### Improved Intune reporting experience<!-- 3791418   -->
Intune now provides an improved reporting experience, including new report types, better report organization, more focused views, improved report functionality, as well as more consistent and timely data. The reporting experience will move from public preview to GA (general availability). Additionally, the GA release will provide localization support, bug fixes, design improvements, and aggregate device compliance data on tiles in the [Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431).

New report types focus on the following information:

- **Operational** - Provides fresh records with a negative health focus. 
- **Organizational** - Provides a broader summary of the overall state.
- **Historical** - Provides patterns and trends over a period of time.
- **Specialist** - Allows you to use raw data to create your own custom reports.

The first set of new reports focuses on device compliance. For more information, see [Blog - Microsoft Intune reporting framework](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Intune-Customer-Success/New-Reporting-Framework-Coming-to-Intune/ba-p/1009553) and [Intune reports](reports.md).

#### Consolidated the location of security baselines in the UI<!-- 6177074   -->
We've consolidated the paths to find [security baselines](../protect/security-baselines.md) in the Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center by removing *Security baselines* from several UI locations. To find Security baselines, you now use the following path:  **Endpoint security** > **Security baselines**.

#### Expanded support for imported PKCS certificates<!-- 6044197  -->
We've expanded support for using [imported PKCS certificates](../protect/certificates-imported-pfx-configure.md#supported-platforms) to support *Android Enterprise fully managed devices*. Generally, importing PFX certificates is used for S/MIME encryption scenarios, where a user's encryption certificates are required on all of their devices so that email decryption can occur.

The following platforms support import of PFX certificates:

- Android - Device Administrator
- Android Enterprise - Fully Managed
- Android Enterprise - Work profile
- iOS
- Mac
- Windows 10

#### View the endpoint security configuration for devices<!-- 6206460  -->
We've updated the name of the option in the Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center, for viewing [endpoint security configurations that apply to a specific device](../protect/security-baselines-monitor.md#view-endpoint-security-configurations-per-device). This option is renamed to **Endpoint security configuration** because it shows applicable security baselines and additional policies created outside of security baselines. Previously, this option was named *Security baselines*.
