## Week of April 3, 2023

### Device configuration

#### Add Google accounts to Android Enterprise personally owned devices with a work profile<!-- 9113561 -->

On Android Enterprise personally owned devices with a work profile, you can configure settings that restrict device features and settings. Currently, there's an **Add and remove accounts** setting. This setting prevents accounts from being added in the work profile, including preventing Google accounts.

This setting changed. You can now add Google accounts. The **Add and remove accounts** setting options are:

- **Block all accounts types**: Prevents users from manually adding or removing accounts in the work profile. For example, when you deploy the Gmail app into the work profile, you can prevent users from adding or removing accounts in this work profile.
- **Allow all accounts types**: Allows all accounts, including Google accounts. These Google accounts are blocked from installing apps from the **Managed Google Play Store**.

  This setting requires:

  - Google Play app version 80970100 or higher

- **Allow all accounts types, except Google accounts** (default): Intune doesn't change or update this setting. By default, the OS might allow adding accounts in the work profile.

For more information on the settings you can configure, go to [Android Enterprise device settings list to allow or restrict features on personally owned devices using Intune](../configuration/device-restrictions-android-enterprise-personal.md).

Applies to:

- Android Enterprise personally owned devices with a work profile

### App management

#### Update macOS DMG apps<!-- 13155074 -->
You can now update apps of type **macOS apps (DMG)** deployed using Intune. Edit a DMG app that is already created in Intune by uploading the update for the app with the same bundle identifier as the original DMG app. For related information, see [Add a macOS DMG app to Microsoft Intune](../apps/lob-apps-macos-dmg.md).

#### Install required apps during pre-provisioning<!-- 12716381 -->
A new toggle is available in the Enrollment Status Page (ESP) profile that allows you to select whether you want to attempt to install required applications during the pre-provisioning (white glove) technician phase. We understand that installing as many applications as possible during pre-provisioning is desired to reduce the end user setup time. If there's an app install failure, ESP continues except for the apps specified in the ESP profile. To enable this function, you need to edit your Enrollment Status Page profile by selecting **Yes** on the new setting entitled **Only fail selected apps in technician phase**. This setting only appears if you have blocking apps selected. For information about ESP, go to [Set up the Enrollment Status Page](../enrollment/windows-enrollment-status.md).

Intune now supports a frontline worker experience for iPhones and iPads using Apple automated device enrollment. You can now enroll devices that are enabled in Azure AD shared mode via zero-touch. For more information about how to configure automated device enrollment for shared device mode, see [Set up enrollment for devices in Azure AD shared device mode](../enrollment/automated-device-enrollment-shared-device-mode.md).  

Applies to:

- iOS/iPadOS

### Device management

#### Endpoint security firewall policy support for log configurations<!-- 16730565   -->  
You can now configure settings in [endpoint security Firewall policy](../protect/endpoint-security-firewall-policy.md#devices-managed-by-intune) that configure firewall logging options. These settings can be found in the *Microsoft Defender Firewall* profile template for the *Windows 10 and later* platform, and are available for the *Domain*, *Private*, and *Public* profiles in that template.

Following are the new settings, all found in the [Firewall configuration service provider (CSP)](/windows/client-management/mdm/Firewall-csp?WT.mc_id=Portal-fx):

- Enable Log Success Connections

### Device security

#### Microsoft Intune Endpoint Privilege Management (public preview)<!-- 15654169   -->  
As a public preview, you can now use Microsoft Intune Endpoint Privilege Management. With Endpoint Privilege Management, admins can set policies that allow standard users to perform tasks normally reserved for an administrator. Endpoint Privilege Management can be configured in the [Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431) at **Endpoint security** > **Endpoint Privilege Management**.

With the public preview, you can configure policies for *automatic* and *user-confirmed* workflows that elevate the run-time permissions for apps or processes you select. You then assign these policies to users or devices that have end users running without Administrator privileges. Once policy is received, Endpoint Privilege Management will broker the elevation on behalf of the user, allowing them to elevate approved applications without needing full administrator privileges. The preview also includes built-in insights and reporting for Endpoint Privilege Management.

To learn how to activate the public preview and use Endpoint Privilege Management policies, start with [Use Endpoint Privilege Management with Microsoft Intune](../protect/epm-overview.md). Endpoint Privilege Management is part of the [Intune Suite](../fundamentals/intune-add-ons.md) offering, and free to try while it remains in public preview.

### Intune apps

### Monitor and troubleshoot

#### Diagnostic data collection for Endpoint Privilege Management<!-- 17392824   -->  
To support the release of Endpoint Privilege Management, we've updated [Collect diagnostics from a Windows device](../remote-actions/collect-diagnostics.md) to include the following data, which is collected from devices enabled for Endpoint Privilege Management:

- Registry keys:  
  - HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\EPMAgent

- Commands:  
  - %windir%\system32\pnputil.exe /enum-drivers
 
- Log files:  
  - %ProgramFiles%\Microsoft EPM Agent\Logs\\\*.*
  - %windir%\system32\config\systemprofile\AppData\Local\mdm\\\*.log

#### View status for pending and failed organizational messages<!-- 17017707  -->  
We've added two more states to organizational message reporting details to make it easier to track pending and failed messages in the admin center.

- **Pending**: The message has not been scheduled yet and is currently in progress.
- **Failed**: The message failed to schedule due to a service error.

For information about reporting details, see [View reporting details for organizational messages](../remote-actions/organizational-messages-reporting.md).  


#### Additional reporting information related to tenant attach devices<!-- 9220597  -->  
You can now view information for tenant attach devices in the existing antivirus reports under the Endpoint Security workload. A new column differentiates between devices managed by Intune and devices managed by Configuration Manager.

### Device management

#### Meta Quest 2 and Quest Pro are now in Open Beta (US only) on Microsoft Intune for Android Open Source Devices

Microsoft Intune for Android open source project devices (AOSP) has welcomed Meta Quest 2 and Quest Pro into Open Beta for the US market.

For more information, go to [Operating systems and browsers supported by Microsoft Intune](../fundamentals/supported-devices-browsers.md)

Applies to:

- Microsoft Intune (AOSP)  

### App management

#### Trusted Root Certificates Management for Intune App SDK for Android<!-- 15135752 -->
If your Android application requires SSL/TLS certificates issued by an on-premises or private certificate authority to provide secure access to internal websites and applications, the Intune App SDK for Android now has support for certificate trust management. For more information and examples, see [Trusted Root Certificates Management](../developer/app-sdk-android-phase7.md#trusted-root-certificates-management).

#### System context support for UWP apps<!-- 16544103 -->
In addition to user context, you can deploy Universal Windows Platform (UWP) apps from the **Microsoft Store app (new)** in system context. If a provisioned *.appx* app is deployed in system context, the app auto-installs for each user that logs in. If an individual end user uninstalls the user context app, the app still shows as installed because it's still provisioned. In addition, the app must not already be installed for any users on the device. Our general recommendation is to not mix install contexts when deploying apps. Win32 apps from the **Microsoft Store app (new)** already support system context.

## Week of March 6, 2023  

### App management

#### Deploy Win32 apps to device groups<!-- 7359954 -->
You can now deploy Win32 apps with **Available** intent to device groups. For more information, see [Win32 app management in Microsoft Intune](../apps/apps-win32-app-management.md). 

### Device management  

#### New URL for Microsoft Intune admin center<!-- 17441426 -->  
The Microsoft Intune admin center has a new URL: [https://intune.microsoft.com](https://intune.microsoft.com). The previously used URL, [https://endpoint.microsoft.com](https://endpoint.microsoft.com), continues to work but will redirect to the new URL in late 2023. We recommend taking the following actions to avoid issues with Intune access and automated scripts: 

* Update login or automation to point to `https://intune.microsoft.com`. 
* Update your firewalls, as needed, to allow access to the new URL. 
* Add the new URL to your favorites and bookmarks. 
* Notify your helpdesk and update IT administrator documentation.  

### Tenant administration

#### Add CMPivot queries to Favorites folder<!-- 16702226 -->
You can add your frequently used queries to a **Favorites** folder in CMPivot. CMPivot allows you to quickly assess the state of a device managed by Configuration Manager via Tenant Attach and take action. The functionality is similar to one already present in the Configuration Manager console. This addition helps you keep all your most used queries in one place. You can also add tags to your queries to help search and find queries. The queries saved in the Configuration Manager console aren't automatically added to your **Favorites** folder. You need to create new queries and add them to this folder. For more information about CMPivot, see [Tenant attach: CMPivot usage overview](../../configmgr/tenant-attach/cmpivot-start.md).

### Device enrollment

#### New Microsoft Store apps now supported with the Enrollment Status Page<!-- 16280325 -->

#### There are default settings for SSO extension requests on iOS, iPadOS, and macOS devices<!-- 15082414-15084030 -->  

When you create a single sign-on app extension configuration profile, there are some settings you configure. The following settings use the following default values for all SSO extension requests:

- **AppPrefixAllowList** key
  - macOS default value: `com.microsoft.,com.apple.`
  - iOS/iPadOS default value: `com.apple.`

- **browser_sso_interaction_enabled** key
  - macOS default value: `1`
  - iOS/iPadOS default value: `1`

- **disable_explicit_app_prompt** key

For more information, see [Add Microsoft Store apps to Microsoft Intune](../apps/store-apps-microsoft.md).

### Tenant administration

#### Access policies for multiple Administrator Approval (public preview)<!-- 9348867  -->
In public preview, you can use Intune *access policies* to require that a second Administrator Approval account be used to approve a change before the change is applied. This capability is known as multiple Administrator Approval (MAA).

You create an access policy to protect a type of resource, like App deployments. Each access policy also includes a group of users who are *approvers* for the changes protected by the policy. When a resource like an app deployment configuration is protected by an access policy, any changes that are made to the deployment, including creating, deleting, or modifying an existing deployment won't apply until a member of the approvers group for that access policy reviews and approves that change.

Approvers can also reject requests, and both the individual requesting a change and the approver can provide notes about the change, or why it was approved or rejected.

Access policies are supported for the following resources:

- **Apps** – Applies to [app deployments](../apps/apps-add.md), but doesn't apply to app protection policies.
- **Scripts** – Applies to deploying scripts to devices that run [macOS](../apps/macos-shell-scripts.md) or [Windows](../apps/intune-management-extension.md).

For more information, see [Use Access policies to require multiple administrative approval](../fundamentals/multi-admin-approval.md).  

### Device security

This preview supports Android, and without any changes to your existing Tunnel infrastructure, supports the Tunnel VPN gateway for:

- Secure access to on-premises apps and resources using modern authentication
- Single Sign On and conditional access

To use Tunnel MAM, unenrolled devices must install Microsoft Edge, Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, and the Company Portal. You can then use the Microsoft Intune admin center to configure the following profiles for the unenrolled devices:

- An App configuration profile for managed apps, to configure Microsoft Defender on devices for use as the Tunnel client app.
- A second App configuration profile for managed apps, to configure Microsoft Edge to connect to Tunnel.
- An App protection profile to enable automatic start of the Microsoft Tunnel connection.

Applies to:

You can group Managed Google Play apps into collections and control the order that collections are displayed when selecting apps in Intune. You can also make apps visible via search only. This capability is available in [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431) by selecting **Apps** > **All apps** > **Add** > **Managed Google Play app**. For related information, see [Add a Managed Google Play store app directly in the Intune admin center](../apps/apps-add-android-for-work.md#add-a-managed-google-play-store-app-directly-in-the-microsoft-intune-admin-center).

### Device configuration

#### New password complexity setting for Android Enterprise 12+ personally owned devices with a work profile<!-- 12436068  -->  
On Android Enterprise 11 and older personally owned devices with a work profile, you can set the following password settings:

- **Compliance policies** > **Android Enterprise for platform** > **Personally owned work profile** > **System security** > **Required password type**, **Minimum password length**
- **Device configuration profiles** > **Android Enterprise for platform** > **Personally owned work profile** > **Device restrictions** > **Work profile settings** > **Required password type**, **Minimum password length**
- **Device configuration profiles** > **Android Enterprise for platform** > **Personally owned work profile** > **Device restrictions** > **Password** > **Required password type**, **Minimum password length**

Google is deprecating the **Required password type** and **Minimum password length** settings for Android 12+ personally owned devices with a work profile and replacing them with new password complexity requirements. For more information about this change, go to [Day zero support for Android 13](https://aka.ms/Intune/Android13).

The new **Password complexity** setting has the following options:

- **None**: Intune doesn't change or update this setting. By default, the OS may not require a password.
- **Low**: Pattern or PIN with repeating (4444) or ordered (1234, 4321, 2468) sequences are blocked.
- **Medium**: PIN with repeating (4444) or ordered (1234, 4321, 2468) sequences are blocked. The length, alphabetic length, or alphanumeric length must be at least 4 characters.
- **High**: PIN with repeating (4444) or ordered (1234, 4321, 2468) sequences are blocked. The length must be at least 8 characters. The alphabetic or alphanumeric length must be at least 6 characters.

On Android 12+, if you currently use the **Required password type** and **Minimum password length** settings in a compliance policy or device configuration profile, then we recommend using the new **Password complexity** setting instead.

### App management

#### Use filters with app configuration policies for managed devices<!-- 7423842  -->  
You can use filters to refine the assignment scope when deploying app configuration policies for managed devices. You must first [create a filter](../fundamentals/filters.md#create-a-filter) using any of the available properties for iOS and Android. Then, in [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431) you can assign your managed app configuration policy by selecting **Apps** > **App configuration policies** > **Add** > **Managed devices** and go to the assignment page. After selecting a group, you can refine the applicability of the policy by choosing a filter and deciding to use it in **Include** or **Exclude** mode. For related information about filters, see [Use filters when assigning your apps, policies, and profiles in Microsoft Intune admin center](../fundamentals/filters.md).

### Device configuration

#### Group Policy analytics automatically applies scope tags assigned to admins when they import Group Policy objects<!-- 16017499 -->  
In Group Policy analytics, you can import your on-premises GPOs to see the policy settings that support cloud-based MDM providers, including Microsoft Intune. You can also see any deprecated settings or settings not available.

Now, scope tags assigned to admins are automatically applied when these admins import GPOs into Group Policy analytics.

For example, admins have "Charlotte", "London", or "Boston" scope tags assigned to their role:

- An admin with the "Charlotte" scope tag imports a GPO. 
- The "Charlotte" scope tag is automatically applied to the imported GPO.
- All admins with the "Charlotte" scope tag can see the imported object.
- Admins with only the "London" or only the "Boston" scope tags can't see the imported object from the "Charlotte" admin.

For admins to see the analytics or migrate the imported GPO to an Intune policy, these admins must have one of the same scope tags as the admin that did the import.

For more information on these features, go to:

- [Analyze your on-premises GPOs using Group Policy analytics in Microsoft Intune](../configuration/group-policy-analytics.md)
- [Use role-based access control (RBAC) and scope tags for distributed IT](scope-tags.md)

For more information, go to [View device details with Microsoft Intune](../remote-actions/device-inventory.md).

Applies to

- iOS/iPadOS

#### Use the `$null` value in filters<!-- 11030128  -->  
When you assign apps and policies to groups, you can use filters to assign a policy based on rules you create (**Tenant administration** > **Filters** > **Create**). These rules use different device properties, such as category or the enrollment profile.

Now, you can use the `$null` value with the `-Equals` and `-NotEquals` operators.

For example, use the `$null` value in the following scenarios:

- You want to target all devices that don't have a category assigned to the device.
- You want to target devices that don't have an enrollment profile property assigned to the device.

For more information on filters and the rules you can create, go to:

- [Use filters when assigning your apps, policies, and profiles in Microsoft Intune](filters.md)
- [Device properties, operators, and rule editing when creating filters in Microsoft Intune](filters-device-properties.md)

### Device security

#### Reusable groups of settings for removable storage in Device Control profiles (preview) <!-- 7351534 -->  
In public preview, you can use [reusable groups of settings](../protect/reusable-settings-groups.md) with [device control profiles](../protect/endpoint-security-asr-policy.md#add-reusable-settings-groups-to-profiles-for-device-control) in your attack surface reduction policies.

The reusable groups for device control profiles include a collection of settings that support managing *read*, *write*, and *execute* access for removable storage. Examples of common scenarios include:

- Prevent write and execute access to all but allow specific approved USBs
- Audit write and execute access to all but block specific unapproved USBs
- Only allow specific user groups to access specific removable storage on a shared PC

Applies to:  
- Windows 10 or later

#### Reusable groups of settings for Microsoft Defender Firewall Rules (preview) <!-- 5653346, 6009541 -->  
In public preview, you can use [reusable groups of settings](../protect/reusable-settings-groups.md) that you can use with [profiles for Microsoft Defender Firewall Rules](../protect/endpoint-security-firewall-policy.md#add-reusable-settings-groups-to-profiles-for-firewall-rules). The reusable groups are collections of remote IP addresses and FQDNs that you define one time and can then use with one or more firewall rule profiles. You don't need to reconfigure the same group of IP addresses in each individual profile that might require them.

Features of the reusable settings groups include:

- Add one or more remote IP addresses.

- Add one or more FQDNs that can auto resolve to the remote IP address, or for one or more simple keywords when auto resolve for the group is off.

- Use each settings group with one or more firewall rule profiles and the different  profiles can support different access configurations for the group.

  For example, you can create two firewall rule profiles that reference the same reusable settings group and assign each profile to a different group of devices. The first profile can block access to all the remote IP addresses in the reusable settings group, while the second profile can be configured to allow access.

- Edits to a settings group that's in use are automatically applied to all Firewall Rules profiles that use that group.  

#### Attack surface reduction rule exclusions on a per-rule basis<!-- 13385644   -->  
You can now [configure per-rule exclusions for Attack surface reduction rules policies](../protect/endpoint-security-asr-policy.md#exclusions-for-attack-surface-reduction-rules). Per-rule exclusions are enabled through a new per-rule setting **ASR Only Per Rule Exclusions**.

When you create or edit attack surface reduction rule policies and change a setting that supports exclusions from the default of *Not configured* to any of the other available options, the new per-setting exclusion option becomes available. Any configurations for that settings instance of *ASR Only Per Rule Exclusions* apply to only that setting.

You can continue to configure global exclusions that apply to all attack surface reduction rules on the device
by using the setting **Attack Surface Reduction Only Exclusions**.

Applies to:

- Windows 10/11

> [!NOTE]  
> ASR polices do not support merge functionality for *ASR Only Per Rule Exclusions* and a policy conflict can result when multiple polices that configure *ASR Only Per Rule Exclusions* for the same device conflict. To avoid conflicts, combine the configurations for *ASR Only Per Rule Exclusions* into a single ASR policy. We are investigating adding policy merge for *ASR Only Per Rule Exclusions* in a future update.

#### Grant apps permission to silently use certificates on Android Enterprise devices<!-- 12441244    -->  
You can now configure silent use of certificates by apps on Android Enterprise devices that enrolled as **Fully Managed, Dedicated, and Corporate-Owned work Profile**.

This capability is available on a new **Apps** page in the certificate profile configuration workflow by setting **Certificate access** to  **Grant silently for specific apps (require user approval for other apps)**.  With this configuration, the apps you then select silently use the certificate. All other apps continue to use the default behavior, which is to require user approval.

This capability is supported for the following certificate profiles for only Android Enterprise Fully Managed, Dedicated, and Corporate-Owned work Profiles:

- [Derived credentials](../protect/derived-credentials.md#use-derived-credentials-for-app-authentication)
- [Imported PKCS](../protect/certificates-imported-pfx-configure.md#create-a-pkcs-imported-certificate-profile)
- [PKCS](../protect/certificates-pfx-configure.md#create-a-pkcs-certificate-profile)
- [SCEP](../protect/certificates-profile-scep.md#create-a-scep-certificate-profile)

#### In-app notifications for Microsoft Intune app<!-- 13110609  -->  
Android Open Source Project(AOSP) device users can now receive compliance notifications in the Microsoft Intune app. This capability is only available on AOSP user-based devices. For more information, see [AOSP compliance notifications](../user-help/check-compliance-aosp.md#compliance-notifications).

### Intune apps

### App management

#### New app types for Microsoft Intune<!-- 7210233 -->
As an admin, you can create and assign two new types of Intune apps:
- **iOS/iPadOS web clip** 
- **Windows web link**

These new app types work in a similar way to the existing **web link** application type, however they apply only for their specific platform, whereas web link applications apply across all platforms. With these new app types, you can assign to groups and also use assignment filters to limit the scope of assignment. This functionality is in the [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431) > **Apps** > **All Apps** > **Add**.

### Device management

#### Microsoft Intune is ending support for Windows 8.1<!-- 14740233 -->
Microsoft Intune is ending support on October 21, 2022 for devices running Windows 8.1. After that date, technical assistance and automatic updates that help protect your devices running Windows 8.1 will no longer be available. Additionally, because the sideloading scenario for line-of-business apps is only applicable to Windows 8.1 devices, Intune no longer supports Windows 8.1 sideloading. Sideloading is installing, and then running or testing an app that isn't certified by the Microsoft Store. In Windows 10/11, "sideloading" is simply setting a device config policy to include "Trusted app installation". For more information, see [Plan for Change: Ending support for Windows 8.1](../fundamentals/whats-new.md#plan-for-change-ending-support-for-windows-81-).

#### Group member count visible in assignments<!-- 13434676 -->

### Device configuration

#### New lock screen message when adding custom support information to Android Enterprise devices<!-- 13158348 -->
On Android Enterprise devices, you can create a device restrictions configuration profile that shows a custom support message on the devices (**Devices** > **Configuration profiles** > **Create profile** > **Android Enterprise** > **Fully managed, dedicated, and corporate-owned work profile** for platform > **Device restrictions** for profile type > **Custom support information**).

There's a new setting you can configure:
- **Lock screen message**: Add a message that's shown on the device lock screen. 

When you configure the **Lock screen message**, you can also use the following device tokens to show device-specific information:
- `{{AADDeviceId}}`: Azure AD device ID
- `{{AccountId}}`: Intune tenant ID or account ID
- `{{DeviceId}}`: Intune device ID
- `{{DeviceName}}`: Intune device name
- `{{domain}}`: Domain name
- `{{EASID}}`: Exchange Active Sync ID
- `{{IMEI}}`: IMEI of the device
- `{{mail}}`: Email address of the user
- `{{MEID}}`: MEID of the device
- `{{partialUPN}}`: UPN prefix before the `@` symbol
- `{{SerialNumber}}`: Device serial number
- `{{SerialNumberLast4Digits}}`: Last four digits of the device serial number
- `{{UserId}}`: Intune user ID
- `{{UserName}}`: User name
- `{{userPrincipalName}}`: UPN of the user

> [!NOTE]
> Variables aren't validated in the UI and are case sensitive. As a result, you may see profiles saved with incorrect input. For example, if you enter `{{DeviceID}}`, instead of `{{deviceid}}` or `{{DEVICEID}}`, then the literal string is shown instead of the device's unique ID. Be sure to enter the correct information. All lowercase or all uppercase variables are supported, but not a mix.

For more information on this setting, go to [Android Enterprise device settings to allow or restrict features using Intune](../configuration/device-restrictions-android-for-work.md#custom-support-information).

Applies to:
- Android 7.0 and newer
- Android Enterprise corporate owned fully managed
- Android Enterprise corporate owned dedicated devices
- Android Enterprise corporate owned work profile

### Device enrollment

#### Set up enrollment notifications (public preview)<!-- 9283605 -->
Enrollment notifications inform device users, via email or push notification, when a new device has been enrolled in Microsoft Intune. You can use enrollment notifications for security purposes to notify users and help them report devices enrolled in error, or for communicating to employees during the hiring or onboarding process. Enrollment notifications are available to try now in public preview for Windows, Apple, and Android devices. This feature is only supported with user-driven enrollment methods.

### Device security

#### Assign compliance policies to the All devices group<!-- 2213410 -->
The **All devices** option is now available for [compliance policy](../protect/create-compliance-policy.md) assignments. With this option, you can assign a compliance policy to all enrolled devices in your organization that match the policy's platform, without needing to create an Azure Active Directory group that contains all devices. 
 
When you include the *All devices* group you can then exclude individual groups of devices to further refine the assignment scope.
