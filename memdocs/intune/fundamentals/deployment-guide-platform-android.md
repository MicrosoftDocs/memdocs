# Deployment guide: Manage Android devices in Microsoft Intune

Intune supports the mobile device management (MDM) of Android devices to give people secure access to work email, data, and apps. This guide provides Android-specific resources to help you set up enrollment in Intune and deploy apps and policies to users and devices.

## Prerequisites  

Before you begin, complete these prerequisites to enable Android device management in Intune. For more detailed information about how to set up, onboard, or move to Intune, see the [Intune setup deployment guide](deployment-guide-intune-setup.md).

* [Add users](users-add.md) and [groups](groups-add.md)
* [Assign licenses to users](licenses-assign.md)
* [Set mobile device management authority](mdm-authority-set.md)

For information about Microsoft Intune roles and permissions, see [RBAC with Microsoft Intune](role-based-access-control.md). The Microsoft Entra [Global Administrator and Intune Administrator](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference) roles have full rights within Microsoft Intune. The Global Administrator has more permissions than needed for many device management tasks in Microsoft Intune. We recommend you use the least privileged role that's needed to complete tasks. For example, the least privileged role that can complete device enrollment tasks is the *Policy and Profile Manager*, a built-in Intune role.  

## Plan for your deployment  

Use the [Microsoft Intune planning guide](intune-planning-guide.md) for help with planning, designing, and implementing Microsoft Intune in your organization. The guide provides information to help you:

* Determine goals, use-case scenarios, and requirements.
* Create rollout and communication plans.
* Create support, testing, and validation plans.

<!-- Commenting out b/c outated; add back in after updates. ## Leverage the Android Enterprise security configuration framework  

The Android Enterprise security configuration framework is a series of recommendations for device compliance and configuration policy settings. These recommendations can help you tailor your organization's mobile device security protection to your specific needs. You can apply them to devices that are fully managed or personally owned with work profiles.

The taxonomy for this framework is similar to the one used for security configurations in iOS. It includes recommended settings for basic, enhanced, and high-level security. Each security level builds off the previous one to offer more protection than the last.

The security levels for personally owned devices with work profile are:  

* Basic security (Level 1) – This configuration is recommended as the minimum security configuration for personal devices where users access work or school data. This configuration introduces password requirements, separates work and personal data, and validates Android device attestation.

* High security (Level 3) – This configuration is recommended for devices used by specific users or groups who are uniquely high risk. For example, users who handle highly sensitive data where unauthorized disclosure causes considerable material loss to the organization. This configuration introduces mobile threat defense or Microsoft Defender Advanced Threat Protection (ATP), enforces stricter Android version requirements, enforces stronger password policies, and further restricts work and personal separation.

The security levels for fully managed devices are:  

* Basic security (Level 1) – This configuration is recommended as the minimum security configuration for supervised devices where users access work or school data. It enforces password requirements, minimum Android version, and certain device restrictions.

* Enhanced security (Level 2) – This configuration is recommended for devices from which users access sensitive or confidential information. It enforces stronger password policies and disables user and account capabilities. It's applicable to most mobile users accessing work or school data on a device.

* High security (Level 3) – This configuration is recommended for devices used by specific users or groups who are uniquely high risk.  For example, users who handle highly sensitive data where unauthorized disclosure causes considerable material loss to the organization. This configuration enforces stricter Android version requirements and other device restrictions, and introduces mobile threat defense or Microsoft Defender ATP.  

For more information about the security framework, see the articles listed in the following table.

| Task | Detail |
| ---- | ------ |
| [Learn about the Android Enterprise framework deployment methodology](../enrollment/android-configuration-framework.md)|Learn about the Microsoft-recommended methodology for deploying the security configuration framework. |
| [Configure device enrollment restrictions for personally owned devices](../enrollment/android-work-profile-security-settings.md)|Apply these restrictions to configure a basic or high security level for devices that are personally owned with work profile. |
| [Disallow personal accounts on Android Enterprise devices](../enrollment/android-app-configuration-policies.md) |Prevent people on work or school devices from signing into Microsoft apps with a personal account. |  
|[Configure security settings for personally owned devices](../enrollment/android-work-profile-security-settings.md)  | Apply these settings to configure a basic or high security level on devices that are personally owned with work profile. |
|[Configure security settings for fully managed devices](../enrollment/android-fully-managed-security-settings.md)  | Apply these settings to configure a basic, enhanced, or high security level on corporate-owned, fully managed devices. | -->

## Create compliance rules  

Use compliance policies to define the rules and conditions that users and devices should meet to access your organization's protected resources. You can also create Conditional Access policies, which work alongside your device compliance results to block access to resources from noncompliant devices. For a detailed explanation about compliance policies and how to get started, see [Use compliance policies to set rules for devices you manage with Intune](../protect/device-compliance-get-started.md).

The following tasks apply to both Android Enterprise and Android device administrator platforms.

| Task | Detail |
| ---- | ------ |
| [Create a compliance policy](../protect/create-compliance-policy.md)|Get step-by-step guidance on how to create and assign a compliance policy to user and device groups.   |
| [Add actions for noncompliance](../protect/actions-for-noncompliance.md) |Choose what happens when devices no longer meet the conditions of your compliance policy. You can add actions for noncompliance when you configure a device compliance policy, or later by editing the policy. |  
| Create [a device-based](../protect/create-conditional-access-intune.md) or [app-based](../protect/app-based-conditional-access-intune-create.md) Conditional Access policy.|Specify the app or services you want to protect and define the conditions for access.
|[Block access to apps that don't use modern authentication](../protect/app-modern-authentication-block.md)  | Create an app-based Conditional Access policy to block apps that use authentication methods other than OAuth2.  For example, you can block apps that use basic and form-based authentication. Before you block any access, sign in to Microsoft Entra ID and review the [authentication methods activity report](/azure/active-directory/authentication/howto-authentication-methods-activity) to see if users are using basic authentication to access essential things (like meeting room calendar kiosks) you forgot about or are unaware of. |

## Configure endpoint security

Use the Intune endpoint security features to configure device security and to manage security tasks for devices at risk.  

The following tasks apply to both Android Enterprise and Android device administrator platforms.
