# Develop a rollout communication plan

Good change management relies on clear and helpful communications about the upcoming changes. To smooth the path of your Intune deployment, your rollout communication plan should include four areas:

- What information is to be communicated

- The delivery method used for the communications

- Who receives the communications

- The timeline for communications

Let's review each area in more detail.

## What needs to be communicated?

Determining what information to be communicated depends on when in the Intune rollout process you are communicating. You might decide to communicate in waves to your organizational groups and users, starting with an Intune rollout kickoff, followed by pre-enrollment, and follow up with post-enrollment. Let's discuss the type of information that could be communicated in each wave.

**Kickoff wave** <br/>Broad communications that introduce the Intune project itself. It should answer questions like what is Intune, why the organization is adopting Intune (benefits to the organization and users), and provide a high-level plan of the deployment and rollout.

**Pre-enrollment wave**<br/> Broad communications that include additional information about Intune and complementary offerings (for example, Office, Outlook, OneDrive), user resources, and specific timelines for when organization groups and users are scheduled to receive Intune.

**Enrollment wave**<br/> Communications targeting organization groups and users that are scheduled to receive Intune. These should inform the users that they are ready to receive Intune and provide enrollment instructions along with contact information for getting assistance or asking questions.

**Post enrollment wave**<br/> Communications targeting organization groups and users that have enrolled in Intune. These should provide additional resources that might be helpful to the user, and collect feedback about their experience during and after enrollment.

You may find this [Intune Adoption Kit](https://aka.ms/IntuneAdoptionKit) helpful. You can use it as-is or modify for your organization.

## Communication delivery methods

There are several delivery methods you can use to communicate Intune rollout information to your targeted organizational groups and users. The following list shows some examples and the wave you can use the method with:

- Organizational-wide in-person or Microsoft Teams meetings used for kickoff wave

- Email used for pre-enrollment, enrollment, and post-enrollment waves

- Organization web sites used for all waves

- Yammer, posters, and flyers used for kickoff and pre-enrollment waves

## Communications timeline

After determining what you need to communicate and the methods you will use, determine the timeline for your communications that includes when and who would receive the communications.

For example, the initial Intune project kickoff communications can target the entire organization or just a subset, and take place over several weeks before the Intune rollout begins. After that, information could be communicated in waves to organizational groups and users, aligned with their Intune rollout schedule. The following example is a sample high-level Intune rollout communications plan:

  | **Communication plan** | **July** | **August** | **September** | **October** |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Wave 1  | All |  |  |  |
| Kickoff meeting | First week |  |  |  |
| Wave 2 | IT | Sales and Marketing | Retail | HR, Finance, and Executives |
| Pre-rollout Email 1 | First week | First week | First week | First week |
| Wave 3 | IT | Sales and Marketing | Retail | HR, Finance, and Executives |
| Pre-rollout Email 2 | Second week | Second week | Second week | Second week |
| Wave 4 | IT | Sales and Marketing | Retail | HR, Finance, and Executives |
| Enrollment email | Third week | Third week | Third week | Third week |
| Wave 5 | IT | Sales and Marketing | Retail | HR, Finance, and Executives |
| Post-enrollment email | Fourth week | Fourth week | Fourth week | Fourth week |
