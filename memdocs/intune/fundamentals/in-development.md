# In development for Microsoft Intune

To help in your readiness and planning, this article lists Intune UI updates and features that are in development but not yet released. In addition to the information in this article:

- When a feature enters production, whether it's in preview or generally available, the feature description will move from this article to [What's new](whats-new.md).  
- Refer to the [Microsoft 365 roadmap](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?rtc=2&filters=EMS) for strategic deliverables and timelines.

This article and the [What's new](whats-new.md) article are updated periodically. Check back for more updates.

### Company Portal automatically installed on Android Enterprise dedicated devices<!-- 6423852  -->  
Intune Company Portal will now be automatically installed on all Android Enterprise dedicated devices to ensure the appropriate handling of app protection policies. Users will not be able to see or launch the Company Portal, and there are no requirements for users to interact with it. Admins will notice that the Company Portal is automatically installed on their Android Enterprise dedicated devices, without the ability to uninstall.

### Uninstall Win32 apps in the Company Portal<!-- 5145748 -->  
*The time frame for the release of this update is still being determined.*

For more information about Win32 apps, go to [Win32 app management in Microsoft Intune](../apps/apps-win32-app-management.md).

### Global quiet time app policy settings<!-- 15424417 -->  
The global quiet time settings will allow you to create policies to schedule quiet time for your end users, which will automatically mute Microsoft Outlook email and Teams notifications on iOS/iPadOS and Android platforms. These policies can be used to limit end user notifications received after work hours. When this feature is available, you will be able to find it in [Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431) by selecting **Apps** > **Quiet Time** > **Policies**.

## Device configuration

This new action will be available under **Devices > iOS/iPadOS > select one of your listed devices > Disable Activation Lock**.

More information on managing Activation Lock is available at [Bypass iOS/iPadOS Activation Lock with Intune - Microsoft Intune | Microsoft Learn](../remote-actions/device-activation-lock-disable.md) or on Apple's website at [Activation Lock for iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch - Apple Support.](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201365).

### Size and generation included in iOS/iPadOS model information<!-- 16406692 -->

### On-demand proactive remediation for a Windows device<!-- 14783338  -->

The **Run** remediation device action will allow you to resolve issues without having to wait for a proactive remediation to run on its assigned schedule. You will also be able to view the status of proactive remediations under **Remediations** in the **Monitor** section of a device.

### Support to delete stale devices that are managed through Security Management for Microsoft Defender for Endpoint<!-- 14729617   -->

The delete option will appear along with other device management options when you view the device’s Overview details. To locate a device managed by this solution, in the admin center go to **Devices** > **All devices**, and then select a device that displays either *MDEJoined* or *MDEManaged* in the *Managed by* column.

### Endpoint security firewall rules support for ICMP type<!-- 5653356 -->  
We’re adding a new setting named **IcmpTypesAndCodes** to the endpoint security firewall rules template for Windows 10. To configure this in the [Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431) by selecting **Endpoint security** > **Firewall** > **Create Policy** > Platform: *Windows 10, Windows 11, and Windows Server*  > Profile: *Microsoft Defender Firewall Rules*).
