# In development for Microsoft Intune

To help in your readiness and planning, this article lists Intune UI updates and features that are in development but not yet released. Also:

- If we anticipate that you'll need to take action before a change, we'll publish a complementary post in the Office message center.
- When a feature enters production, whether it's in preview or generally available, the feature description will move from this article to [What's new](whats-new.md).
- Refer to the [Microsoft 365 roadmap](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?rtc=2&filters=EMS) for strategic deliverables and timelines.

This article and the [What's new](whats-new.md) article are updated periodically. Check back for more updates.

> [!NOTE]
> This article reflects our current expectations about Intune capabilities in an upcoming release. Dates and individual features might change. This article doesn't describe all features in development. It was last updated on the date shown under the title.

## Microsoft Intune Suite

### Use Copilot with Endpoint Privilege Manager to help identify potential elevation risks<!-- 27265509 -->

We’re adding support for Copilot to help you investigate Endpoint Privilege Manager (EPM) elevation details. Copilot will help you evaluate information from you EPM elevation requests to identify potential indicators of compromise by using information from [Microsoft Defender](/defender-endpoint/microsoft-defender-endpoint).

EPM is available as an [Intune Suite add-on-capability](../fundamentals/intune-add-ons.md). To learn more about how you can use Copilot in Intune, see [Microsoft Copilot in Intune](../copilot/copilot-intune-overview.md).

### Endpoint Privilege Manager elevation rule support for file arguments and parameters<!--28077130 -->

Soon, the file elevation rules for Endpoint Privilege Manager (EPM) will support use of arguments or parameters that you want to allow. Arguments and parameters that aren't explicitly allowed will be blocked from use. This capability helps to improve control of the context for file elevations.

EPM is available as an [Intune Suite add-on-capability](../fundamentals/intune-add-ons.md).

<!-- ***********************************************-->

## App management

### Updates to app configuration policies for Android Enterprise devices<!-- 26711672 -->

App configuration policies for Android Enterprise devices will soon support overriding the following additional permissions:

- Access background location
- Bluetooth (connect)

For more information about app configuration policies for Android Enterprise devices, see [Add app configuration policies for managed Android Enterprise devices](../apps/app-configuration-policies-use-android.md).

Applies to:

- Android Enterprise devices

### New UI for Intune Company Portal app for Windows<!-- 27219294 -->

The UI for the Intune Company Portal app for Windows will be updated. Users will be able to use the same functionality they’re used to with an improved experience for their desktop app. With the updated design, users will see improvements in user experience for the **Home**, **Devices**, and **Downloads & updates** pages. The new design will be more intuitive and will highlight areas where users need to take action.

For more information, see [New look for Intune Company Portal app for Windows](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/intune-customer-success/new-look-for-intune-company-portal-app-for-windows/ba-p/4158755).

### Added protection for iOS/iPadOS app widgets<!-- 14614429 -->

To protect organizational data for MAM managed accounts and apps, Intune app protection policies now provide the capability to block data sync from policy managed app data to app widgets. App widgets can be added to end-user's iOS/iPadOS device lock screen, which can expose data contained by these widgets, such as meeting titles, top sites, and recent notes. In Intune, you'll be able to set the app protection policy setting **Sync policy managed app data with app widgets** to **Block** for iOS/iPadOS apps. This setting will be available as part of the **Data Protection** settings in app protection policies. This new setting will be an app protection feature similar to the **Sync policy managed app data with native app or add-ins** setting.

Applies to:

- iOS/iPadOS

## Device management

### Minimum OS version for Android devices will be Android 10 and later for user-based management methods<!-- 14755802 -->

From October 2024, the minimum OS supported for Android devices will be Android 10 and later for user-based management methods, which includes:

- Android Enterprise personally-owned work profile
- Android Enterprise corporate owned work profile
- Android Enterprise fully managed
- Android Open Source Project (AOSP) user-based
- Android device administrator
- App protection policies (APP)
- App configuration policies (ACP) for managed apps

For enrolled devices on unsupported OS versions (Android 9 and lower)

- Intune technical support won't be provided.
- Intune won't make changes to address bugs or issues.
- New and existing features aren't guaranteed to work.

While Intune won't prevent enrollment or management of devices on unsupported Android OS versions, functionality isn't guaranteed, and use isn't recommended.

Userless methods of Android device management (Dedicated and AOSP userless) and Microsoft Teams certified Android devices won't be affected by this change.

### Device Inventory for Windows<!-- 24853010 -->

Device inventory lets you collect and view additional hardware properties from your managed devices to help you better understand the state of your devices and make business decisions.

You'll soon be able to choose what you want to collect from your devices, using the catalog of properties and then view the collected properties in the Resource Explorer view.

Applies to:

- Windows (Corporate owned devices managed by Intune)

### Collection of additional device inventory details<!-- 29460196 -->

We're adding additional files and registry keys to be collected to assist in troubleshooting the Device Hardware Inventory feature.

Applies to:

- Windows

## Device security

### New strong mapping requirements for Intune-issued SCEP certificates<!-- 29005591 -->

To align with the Windows Kerberos Key Distribution Center's (KDC) strong mapping attribute requirements described in [KB5014754](https://support.microsoft.com/help/5014754), SCEP certificates issued by Microsoft Intune will be required to have the following tag in the Subject Alternative Name (SAN) field:

`URL=tag:microsoft.com,2022-09-14:sid:<value>`

This tag will ensure that certificates are compliant with the KDC's latest requirements, and that certificate-based authentication continues working. Microsoft Intune will be adding support for the SID variable in SCEP profiles. You will be able to modify or create a new SCEP profile to include the OnPremisesSecurityIdentifier variable in the SCEP profile. This action will trigger Microsoft Intune to issue new certificates with the appropriate tag to all applicable users and devices.

These requirements apply to:

- Android, iOS/iPadOS, and macOS user certificates.
- Windows 10/11 user and device certificates.

They don't apply to device certificates used with Microsoft Entra joined users or devices, because SID is an on-premises identifier.

### Support for Intune Device control policy for devices managed by Microsoft Defender for Endpoint<!-- 15466620 -->

You'll be able to use the endpoint security policy for *Device control* (Attack surface reduction policy) from the Microsoft Intune with the devices you manage through the [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint security settings management](../protect/mde-security-integration.md) capability.

- **Device control** policies are part of endpoint security [Attack surface reduction policy](../protect/endpoint-security-asr-policy.md).

Applies to the following when you use the *Windows 10, Windows 11, and Windows Server* platform:

- Windows 10
- Windows 11

When this change takes effect, devices that are assigned this policy while managed by Defender for Endpoint but not enrolled with Intune, will now apply the settings from the policy. Check your policy to make sure only the devices you intend to receive this policy will get it.
