# In development for Microsoft Intune

To help in your readiness and planning, this article lists Intune UI updates and features that are in development but not yet released. Also:

- If we anticipate that you'll need to take action before a change, we'll publish a complementary post in the Office message center.
- When a feature enters production, whether it's in preview or generally available, the feature description will move from this article to [What's new](whats-new.md).  
- Refer to the [Microsoft 365 roadmap](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?rtc=2&filters=EMS) for strategic deliverables and timelines.

This article and the [What's new](whats-new.md) article are updated periodically. Check back for more updates.

> [!NOTE]
> This article reflects our current expectations about Intune capabilities in an upcoming release. Dates and individual features might change. This article doesn't describe all features in development. It was last updated on the date shown under the title.

<!-- ***********************************************-->

## App management  

### Intune APP SDK for .NET MAUI<!-- 17696301   -->  
Using the Intune APP SDK for .NET MAUI, you'll be able to develop Android or iOS apps for Intune that incorporate the [.NET Multi-platform App UI](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/maui). Apps developed using this framework will allow you to enforce [Intune mobile application management](../apps/app-management.md).

### Intune migrating from SafetyNet Attestation API to Google Play Integrity API<!-- 15571389   -->  
Google has deprecated the [SafetyNet Attestation API](https://developer.android.com/training/safetynet/attestation) and replaced it with the [Play Integrity API](https://developer.android.com/google/play/integrity). Intune will be migrating to the new API for app protection policies. The "SafetyNet device attestation" setting name will be updated to align with the new Google Play Integrity API for all policies in the Intune user interface (UI). For related information, see [Discontinuing the SafetyNet Attestation API](https://developer.android.com/training/safetynet/deprecation-timeline) and [Migrating from the SafetyNet Attestation API](https://developer.android.com/google/play/integrity/migrate).

### Enterprise application management<!-- 10986080  -->  
Enterprise Application Management provides a catalog of prepackaged applications designed to simplify discovery, delivery, and updates for third and first party apps. Enterprise Application Management will be generally available in early Q1 2024.

### Company Portal automatically installed on Android Enterprise dedicated devices<!-- 6423852  -->  
Intune Company Portal will now be automatically installed on all Android Enterprise dedicated devices to ensure the appropriate handling of app protection policies. Users won't be able to see or launch the Company Portal, and there are no requirements for users to interact with it. Admins will notice that the Company Portal is automatically installed on their Android Enterprise dedicated devices, without the ability to uninstall.

### Support for multi-SIM iOS/iPadOS device inventory<!--17016690  -->  
You'll be able to view the service subscription fields on devices that have multiple SIM cards installed under the per-device Hardware section. The inventory fields that are capable of reporting multiple values to Intune are:

- **ICCID**
- **IMEI**
- **MEID**
- **Phone number**

These fields will default to using labels returned by the device, such as:  *Primary*, *Secondary*, *CTSubscriptionSlotOne*, and *CTSubscriptionSlotTwo*. These returned labels may be displayed in the language of the local device that is reporting its inventory to Intune.

Applies to:

- **iOS/iPadOS**

<!-- *********************************************** -->

## Device configuration

### The macOS Company Portal app will support platform SSO (public preview)<!-- 24325427  -->  
In Intune, you can configure the Enterprise single sign-on (SSO) plug-in on Apple devices using a device configuration profile (**Devices** > **Configuration profiles** > **Create profile** > **macOS** for platform > **Templates > Device features** for profile > **Single sign-on app extension**).

The Company Portal app version will support the platform SSO settings for macOS 13 and later. Platform SSO allows you to sync your Microsoft Entra ID password to local accounts on Macs using the Enterprise Single Sign-On extension.

For more information on the Enterprise SSO plug-in, go to:

- [Use Intune to deploy the Microsoft Enterprise SSO plug-in for Apple devices](../configuration/use-enterprise-sso-plug-in-ios-ipados-macos.md)
- [Entra ID and the Microsoft Enterprise SSO plug-in overview for Apple devices](/azure/active-directory/develop/apple-sso-plugin)

Applies to:

- macOS 13 and later

### Use assignment filters on Endpoint Privilege Management (EPM) policies<!-- 25230705   -->  
You can use assignment filters to assign a policy based on rules you create. A filter allows you to narrow the assignment scope of a policy, like targeting devices with a specific OS version or a specific manufacturer.

You can use filters on Endpoint Privilege Management (EPM) policies.

For more information about assignment filters, go to [Use filters when assigning your apps, policies, and profiles in Intune](filters.md).

Applies to:

- Windows 10/11

## Device management

### Introducing a remote action to pause the config refresh enforcement interval<!--24249019  -->  
In the Windows Settings Catalog you can configure **Config Refresh**. This feature lets you set a cadence for Windows devices to reapply previously received policy settings, without requiring devices to check-in to Intune. The device will replay and re-enforce settings based on previously received policy to minimize the chance for configuration drift.

To support this feature, a remote action will be added to allow a pause in action. If an admin needs to make changes or run remediation on a device for troubleshooting or maintenance, they can issue a pause from Intune for a specified period. When the period expires, settings will be enforced again.

The remote action **Pause config refresh** can be accessed from the device summary page.

For information on currently available Remote actions, see [Remote actions](../remote-actions/device-management.md).
