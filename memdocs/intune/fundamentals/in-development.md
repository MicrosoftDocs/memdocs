# In development for Microsoft Intune

To help in your readiness and planning, this article lists Intune UI updates and features that are in development but not yet released. Also:

- If we anticipate that you'll need to take action before a change, we'll publish a complementary post in the Office message center.
- When a feature enters production, whether it's in preview or generally available, the feature description will move from this article to [What's new](whats-new.md).  
- Refer to the [Microsoft 365 roadmap](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?rtc=2&filters=EMS) for strategic deliverables and timelines.

This article and the [What's new](whats-new.md) article are updated periodically. Check back for more updates.

> [!NOTE]
> This article reflects our current expectations about Intune capabilities in an upcoming release. Dates and individual features might change. This article doesn't describe all features in development. It was last updated on the date shown under the title.

## App management  

### Intune migrating from SafetyNet Attestation API to Google Play Integrity API<!-- 15571389   -->  
Google has deprecated the [SafetyNet Attestation API](https://developer.android.com/training/safetynet/attestation) and replaced it with the [Play Integrity API](https://developer.android.com/google/play/integrity). Intune will be migrating to the new API for app protection policies. The "SafetyNet device attestation" setting name will be updated to align with the new Google Play Integrity API for all policies in the Intune user interface (UI). For related information, see [Discontinuing the SafetyNet Attestation API](https://developer.android.com/training/safetynet/deprecation-timeline) and [Migrating from the SafetyNet Attestation API](https://developer.android.com/google/play/integrity/migrate).

### Enterprise application management<!-- 10986080  -->  
Enterprise Application Management provides a catalog of prepackaged applications designed to simplify discovery, delivery, and updates for third and first party apps. Enterprise Application Management will be generally available in early Q1 2024.

### Company Portal automatically installed on Android Enterprise dedicated devices<!-- 6423852  -->  
Intune Company Portal will now be automatically installed on all Android Enterprise dedicated devices to ensure the appropriate handling of app protection policies. Users won't be able to see or launch the Company Portal, and there are no requirements for users to interact with it. Admins will notice that the Company Portal is automatically installed on their Android Enterprise dedicated devices, without the ability to uninstall.

### Support for multi-SIM iOS/iPadOS device inventory<!--17016690 (replaced 16360290 for tracking) -->  
You'll be able to view the service subscription fields on devices that have multiple SIM cards installed under the per-device Hardware section. The inventory fields that are capable of reporting multiple values to Intune are:

- **ICCID**
- **IMEI**
- **MEID**
- **Phone number**

These fields will default to using labels returned by the device, such as:  *Primary*, *Secondary*, *CTSubscriptionSlotOne*, and *CTSubscriptionSlotTwo*. These returned labels may be displayed in the language of the local device that is reporting its inventory to Intune.

Applies to:

- **iOS/iPadOS**

## Device management

### Introducing a remote action to pause the config refresh enforcement interval<!--24249019  -->  
In the Windows Settings Catalog you can configure **Config Refresh**. This feature lets you set a cadence for Windows devices to reapply previously received policy settings, without requiring devices to check-in to Intune. The device will replay and re-enforce settings based on previously received policy to minimize the chance for configuration drift.

To support this feature, a remote action will be added to allow a pause in action. If an admin needs to make changes or run remediation on a device for troubleshooting or maintenance, they can issue a pause from Intune for a specified period. When the period expires, settings will be enforced again.

The remote action **Pause config refresh** can be accessed from the device summary page.

For information on currently available Remote actions, see [Remote actions](../remote-actions/device-management.md).

## Device security

### Updated security baseline for Microsoft 365 Apps for Enterprise.<!-- 25021846  -->  
We're working on an update to the Intune security baseline for Microsoft 365 Apps for Enterprise. This update will bring support for recent settings so you can continue to maintain best-practice configurations for Office apps.

For information about security baselines with Intune, see [Use security baselines to configure Windows devices in Intune](../protect/security-baselines.md).

### Defender for Endpoint security settings management enhancements and support for Linux and macOS will soon be generally available<!-- 24190967  -->  
The improvements introduced in the Defender for Endpoint security settings management [opt-in public preview](../fundamentals/whats-new.md#defender-for-endpoint-security-settings-management-enhancements-and-support-for-linux-and-macos-in-public-preview) will soon be generally available. This change will include support all of the opt-in preview behavior – without having to enable support for preview features in Microsoft Defender for Endpoint.

When the opt-in public preview behavior becomes generally available, the following endpoint security profiles for Linux and macOS that were added as part of the opt-in preview will also generally available:

**Linux**:

- Microsoft Defender Antivirus
- Microsoft Defender Antivirus exclusions
- Endpoint detection and response

**MacOS**:

- Microsoft Defender Antivirus
- Microsoft Defender Antivirus exclusions
- Endpoint detection and response

For more information, see [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Security settings management](../protect/mde-security-integration.md?pivots=mdssc-preview) in the Intune documentation.
