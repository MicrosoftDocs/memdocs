## Microsoft Intune Suite

### Use Copilot with Endpoint Privilege Manager to help identify potential elevation risks<!-- 27265509 -->

Weâ€™re adding support for Copilot to help you investigate Endpoint Privilege Manager (EPM) elevation details. Copilot will help you evaluate information from you EPM elevation requests to identify potential indicators of compromise by using information from [Microsoft Defender](/defender-endpoint/microsoft-defender-endpoint).

EPM is available as an [Intune Suite add-on-capability](../fundamentals/intune-add-ons.md). To learn more about how you can use Copilot in Intune, see [Microsoft Copilot in Intune](../copilot/copilot-intune-overview.md).

### Endpoint Privilege Manager elevation rule support for file arguments and parameters<!--28077130 -->

Soon, the file elevation rules for Endpoint Privilege Manager (EPM) will support use of arguments or parameters that you want to allow. Arguments and parameters that aren't explicitly allowed will be blocked from use. This capability helps to improve control of the context for file elevations.

EPM is available as an [Intune Suite add-on-capability](../fundamentals/intune-add-ons.md).

<!-- ***********************************************-->

## App management

### Additional reporting details for LOB apps on AOSP devices<!-- 27157460  -->

Additional details will be provided for app installation reporting of Line of Business (LOB) apps on Android Open Source Project (AOSP) devices. You will be able to see error codes and detailed error messages for LOB apps. For information about app status details, see [Monitor app information and assignments with Microsoft Intune](../apps/apps-monitor.md).

Applies to:

- Android Open Source Project (AOSP) devices

### Added protection for iOS/iPadOS app widgets<!-- 14614429 -->

To protect organizational data for MAM managed accounts and apps, Intune app protection policies now provide the capability to block data sync from policy managed app data to app widgets. App widgets can be added to end-user's iOS/iPadOS device lock screen, which can expose data contained by these widgets, such as meeting titles, top sites, and recent notes. In Intune, you'll be able to set the app protection policy setting **Sync policy managed app data with app widgets** to **Block** for iOS/iPadOS apps. This setting will be available as part of the **Data Protection** settings in app protection policies. This new setting will be an app protection feature similar to the **Sync policy managed app data with native app or add-ins** setting.

Applies to:

- iOS/iPadOS

<!-- *********************************************** -->

## Device configuration

### Device Firmware Configuration Interface (DFCI) support for Samsung devices<!-- 29107197 -->

We're adding support to use DFCI profiles to manage UEFI (BIOS) settings for Samsung devices that run Windows 10 or Windows 11. Not all Samsung devices running Windows are enabled for DFCI. Contact your device vendor or device manufacturer for eligible devices.

You can manage DFCI profiles from within the [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431) by going to **Devices** > **Manage devices** > **Configuration** > **Create** > **New policy** > **Windows 10 and later** for platform > **Templates** > **Device Firmware Configuration Interface** for profile type. For more information about DFCI profiles, see:

- [Configure Device Firmware Configuration Interface (DFCI) profiles on Windows devices in Microsoft Intune](../configuration/device-firmware-configuration-interface-windows.md)
- [Device Firmware Configuration Interface (DFCI) management with Windows Autopilot](../../autopilot/dfci-management.md)

Applies to:

- Windows

### New settings for Windows 24H2 in the Windows settings catalog<!-- 29592329 -->

The Settings Catalog lists all the settings you can configure in a device policy, and all in one place. You can view these Windows settings in the Microsoft Intune admin center by going to **Devices** > **Manage devices** > **Configuration** > **Create** > **New policy** > **Windows 10 and later for platform** > **Settings catalog** for profile type.

We're working on the addition of new settings for Window 24H2.

Applies to:

- Windows

### New settings available in the Apple settings catalog <!--29038336 -->

The [Settings Catalog](../configuration/settings-catalog.md) lists all the settings you can configure in a device policy, and all in one place. For more information about configuring Settings Catalog profiles in Intune, see [Create a policy using settings catalog](../configuration/settings-catalog.md).

We're adding new settings to the Settings Catalog. To view available settings, in the [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431), go to **Devices** > **Manage devices** > **Configuration** > **Create** > **New policy** > **iOS/iPadOS** or **macOS** for platform > **Settings catalog** for profile type.

## Device management

### Store macOS certificates in user keychain<!-- 7824255 -->

Soon you'll have the option to store macOS certificates in the user keychain. Currently, Microsoft Intune automatically stores user and device certificates in the *device* keychain. The enhancement will strengthen system security, and will improve the user experience by reducing certificate prompts.

Applies to:

- macOS

### Device Inventory for Windows<!-- 24853010 -->

Device inventory lets you collect and view additional hardware properties from your managed devices to help you better understand the state of your devices and make business decisions.

You'll soon be able to choose what you want to collect from your devices, using the catalog of properties and then view the collected properties in the Resource Explorer view.

Applies to:

- Windows (Corporate owned devices managed by Intune)

<!-- *********************************************** -->

## Device security

### Linux support for Endpoint detection and response exclusion settings<!-- 26549863 -->

We are adding a new Endpoint Security template under Endpoint detection and response (EDR) for the Linux platform, that will be supported through the [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint security settings management](../protect/mde-security-integration.md) scenario.

The template will support settings related to global exclusion settings. Applicable to antivirus and EDR engines on the client, the settings can configure exclusions to stop associated real time protection EDR alerts for the excluded items. Exclusions can be defined by the file path, folder, or process explicitly defined by the admin in the policy.

Applies to:

- Linux

### New Microsoft Tunnel readiness check for auditd package<!-- 28148207 -->

We're updating the [Microsoft Tunnel readiness tool](../protect/microsoft-tunnel-prerequisites.md#run-the-readiness-tool) to detect if the **auditd** package for Linux System Auditing (LSA) is installed on your Linux Server. When this check is in place, the mst-readiness tool will raise a warning if the audit package isn't installed. Auditing isn't a required prerequisite for the Linux Server, but recommended.

For more information on *auditd* and how to install it on your Microsoft Tunnel server, see [Linux system auditing](../protect/microsoft-tunnel-prerequisites.md#linux-system-auditing).


### Support for Intune Device control policy for devices managed by Microsoft Defender for Endpoint<!-- 15466620 -->

You'll be able to use the endpoint security policy for *Device control* (Attack surface reduction policy) from the Microsoft Intune with the devices you manage through the [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint security settings management](../protect/mde-security-integration.md) capability.

- **Device control** policies are part of endpoint security [Attack surface reduction policy](../protect/endpoint-security-asr-policy.md).

Applies to the following when you use the *Windows 10, Windows 11, and Windows Server* platform:

- Windows 10
- Windows 11

When this change takes effect, devices that are assigned this policy while managed by Defender for Endpoint but not enrolled with Intune, will now apply the settings from the policy. Check your policy to make sure only the devices you intend to receive this policy will get it.
