# How your Windows users get their apps

Use this information to understand how and where your users get the apps that you distribute through Microsoft Intune.

**Required apps** are required by the administrator and that are installed on the device with minimal user involvement, depending on the platform.

**Available apps** are provided in the Company Portal app list and that a user might choose to install.

**Managed apps** can be managed through policies and that have been "wrapped" by Intune or have been built with the Intune App Software Development Kit (SDK). These apps can be managed by Intune, and app protection policies can be applied to them.

**Unmanaged apps** can be managed through policies and that have not been wrapped by Intune or that do not incorporate the Intune App SDK. App protection policies cannot be applied to these apps.
