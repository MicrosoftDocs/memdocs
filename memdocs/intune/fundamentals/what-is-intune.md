- [Deployment guide: Enroll macOS devices in Microsoft Intune](deployment-guide-enrollment-macos.md)

## Enroll in device management, application management, or both

✅ Organization-owned devices are enrolled in Intune for **mobile device management (MDM)**. MDM is device centric, so device features are configured based on who needs them. For example, you can configure a device to allow access to Wi-Fi, but only if the signed-in user is an organization account.

In Intune, you create policies that configure features & settings and provide security & protection. Your admin team fully manages the devices, including the user identities that sign in, the apps that are installed, and the data that's accessed.

When devices enroll, you can deploy your policies during the enrollment process. When enrollment completes, the device is ready to use.

✅ For personal devices in bring-your-own-device (BYOD) scenarios, you can use Intune for **mobile application management (MAM)**. MAM is user centric, so the app data is protected regardless of the device used to access this data. There's a focus on apps, including securely accessing apps and protecting data within the apps.

With MAM, you can:

- Publish mobile apps to users.
- Configure apps and automatically update apps.
- View data reports that focus on app inventory and app usage.

✅ You can also use MDM and MAM together. If your devices are enrolled and there are apps that need extra security, then you can also use MAM app protection policies.

For more information, go to:

- [Device enrollment in Intune?](deployment-guide-enrollment.md)
- [App protection policies overview](../apps/app-protection-policy.md)

## Protect data on any device

With Intune, you can **protect data on managed devices** (enrolled in Intune) and **protect data on unmanaged devices** (not enrolled in Intune). Intune can isolate organization data from personal data. The idea is to protect your company information using policies that you configure and deploy.

For organization-owned devices, you want full control over the devices, especially security. When devices enroll, they receive your security rules and settings.

On devices enrolled in Intune, you can:

- Create and deploy policies that configure security settings, set password requirements, deploy certificates, and more.
- Use mobile threat defense services to scan devices, detect threats, and remediate threats.
- View data and reports that measure compliance with your security settings and rules.
- Use conditional access to only allow managed and compliant devices access to organization resources, apps, and data.
- Remove organization data if a device is lost or stolen.

For personal devices, users might not want their IT admins to have full control. To support a hybrid work environment, give users options. For example, users enroll their devices if they want full access to your organization's resources. Or, if these users only want access to Outlook or Microsoft Teams, then use app protection policies that require multifactor authentication (MFA).

On devices using application management, you can:

- Use mobile threat defense services to protect app data. The service can scan devices, detect threats, and assess risk.
- Prevent organization data from being copied and pasted into personal apps.
- Use app protection policies on apps and on unmanaged devices enrolled in a third party or partner MDM.
- Use conditional access to restrict the apps that can access organization email and files.
- Remove organization data within apps.

For more information, go to:

- [Protect data and devices with Microsoft Intune](../protect/device-protect.md)
- [Mobile Threat Defense integration with Intune](../protect/mobile-threat-defense.md)

## Simplify access

Intune helps organizations support employees who can work from anywhere. There are features you can configure that allow users to connect to an organization, wherever they might be.

This section includes some common features that you can configure in Intune.

### Use Windows Hello for Business instead of passwords

Windows Hello for Business helps protect against phishing attacks and other security threats. It also helps users sign in to their devices and apps more quickly and easily.

Windows Hello for Business replaces passwords with a PIN or biometric, such as fingerprint or facial recognition. This biometric information is stored locally on the devices and is never sent to external devices or servers.

For more information, go to:

- [Get an overview Windows Hello for Business](/windows/security/identity-protection/hello-for-business/hello-overview)
- [Manage Windows Hello for Business on devices when they enroll in Intune](../protect/windows-hello.md)
- [Manage identities using Microsoft Intune](manage-identities.md)

### Create a VPN connection for remote users

VPN policies give users secure remote access to your organization network.

Using common VPN connection partners, including Check Point, Cisco, Microsoft Tunnel, NetMotion, Pulse Secure, and more, you can create a VPN policy with your network settings. When the policy is ready, you deploy this policy to your users and devices that need to connect to your network remotely.

In the VPN policy, you can use certificates to authenticate the VPN connection. When you use certificates, your end users don't need to enter usernames and passwords.

For more information, go to:

- [Create VPN profiles to connect to VPN servers in Intune](../configuration/vpn-settings-configure.md)
- [Use certificates for authentication in Intune](../protect/certificates-configure.md)
- [Learn more about Microsoft Tunnel for Intune](../protect/microsoft-tunnel-overview.md)
- [Use Microsoft Tunnel for MAM](../protect/microsoft-tunnel-mam.md)

### Create a Wi-Fi connection for on-premises users

For users who need to connect to your organization network on-premises, you can create a Wi-Fi policy with your network settings. You can connect to a specific SSID, select an authentication method, use a proxy, and more. You can also configure the policy to automatically connect to Wi-Fi when the device is in range.

In the Wi-Fi policy, you can use certificates to authenticate the Wi-Fi connection. When you use certificates, your end users don't need to enter usernames and passwords.

When the policy is ready, you deploy this policy to your on-premises users and devices that need to connect to your on-premises network.

For more information, go to:

- [Create Wi-Fi policy to connect to Wi-Fi networks in Intune](../configuration/wi-fi-settings-configure.md)
- [Use certificates for authentication in Microsoft Intune](../protect/certificates-configure.md)

### Enable single sign-on (SSO) to your apps and services

When you enable SSO, users can automatically sign in to apps and services using their Microsoft Entra organization account, including some mobile threat defense partner apps.

Specifically:

- On Windows devices, SSO is automatically built in and used to sign in to apps and websites that use Microsoft Entra ID for authentication, including Microsoft 365 apps. You can also enable SSO on VPN and Wi-Fi policies.

- On iOS/iPadOS and macOS devices, you can use the Microsoft Enterprise SSO plug-in to automatically sign in to apps and websites that use Microsoft Entra ID for authentication, including Microsoft 365 apps.

  For more information, go to [Single sign-on (SSO) overview and options for Apple devices in Microsoft Intune](../configuration/use-enterprise-sso-plug-in-ios-ipados-macos.md).

- On Android devices, you can use the Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL) to enable SSO to Android apps.

  For more information, go to:

  - [How SSO to on-premises resources works on Microsoft Entra joined devices](/azure/active-directory/devices/azuread-join-sso)
  - [Use the Microsoft Enterprise SSO plug-in on iOS/iPadOS and macOS devices in Microsoft Intune](../configuration/use-enterprise-sso-plug-in-ios-ipados-macos.md)
