# Deployment guide: Manage macOS devices in Microsoft Intune

Secure access to work email, data, and apps on macOS devices. This article guides you through macOS-specific tasks to help you enable Intune mobile device management for macOS, configure policies, and deploy apps.  


## Prerequisites  

Complete the following prerequisites to enable macOS device management in Intune:      

* [Add users](users-add.md) and [groups](groups-add.md)
* [Assign licenses to users](licenses-assign.md) 
* [Set mobile device management authority](mdm-authority-set.md) 
* [Set up Apple MDM push (APNs) certificate](../enrollment/apple-mdm-push-certificate-get.md)  

For information about Microsoft Intune roles and permissions, see [RBAC with Microsoft Intune](../fundamentals/role-based-access-control.md). The Microsoft Entra [Global Administrator and Intune Administrator](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference) roles have full rights within Microsoft Intune. The Global Administrator has more permissions than needed for many device management tasks in Microsoft Intune. We recommend you use the least privileged role that's needed to complete tasks. For example, the least privileged role that can complete device enrollment tasks is the *Policy and Profile Manager*, a built-in Intune role.  

 For more detailed information about how to do the initial setup, onboard, or move to Microsoft Intune, see the [Intune setup deployment guide](deployment-guide-intune-setup.md).    

## Plan for your deployment  

Use the [Microsoft Intune planning guide](intune-planning-guide.md) to define your device management goals, use-case scenarios, and requirements. It will also help you plan for rollout, communication, support, testing, and validation. For example, because the Company Portal app for macOS isn't available in the App Store, we recommend having a communication plan so that end users know how to install Company Portal and enroll their devices.    

## Enroll devices  

Configure the enrollment methods and experience for company-owned and personal macOS devices. This step ensures that devices receive Intune policies and configurations after they enroll. Intune supports Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) enrollment, Apple Automated Device Enrollment, and direct enrollment for corporate devices. For information about each enrollment method and how to choose one that's right for your organization, see the [macOS device enrollment guide for Microsoft Intune](deployment-guide-enrollment-macos.md). 
 

| Task | Detail | 
| ---- | ------ | 
|[Set up enrollment for user-owned (BYOD) devices](../enrollment/macos-enroll.md)| Complete the prerequisites in this article to enable enrollment for user-owned devices. You'll also find enrollment resources and links to share with device users so that they're supported throughout the enrollment experience. This enrollment method is for organizations that have *Bring Your Own Device* (BYOD) policies. BYOD lets people use their personal devices for work-related things. | 
|[Set up Apple Automated Device Enrollment (ADE)](../enrollment/device-enrollment-program-enroll-macos.md)|Set up an out-of-the-box enrollment experience that automates enrollment on corporate-owned devices purchased through Apple School Manager or Apple Business Manager. This method is ideal for organizations that have a large number of devices to enroll, because it eliminates the need to touch and configure each device individually.  |  
|[Set up direct enrollment for corporate devices](../enrollment/device-enrollment-direct-enroll-macos.md)| Set up an enrollment experience for corporate-owned devices that are unaffiliated with a single user, like devices used in a shared space or retail setting. Direct enrollment doesn't wipe the device so it's ideal to use when devices don't need access to local user data. You'll need to transfer the enrollment profile to the Mac directly, which requires a USB connection to a Mac computer running Apple Configurator.|  
|[Add a device enrollment manager](../enrollment/device-enrollment-manager-enroll.md)| People designated as device enrollment managers (DEM) can enroll up to 1,000 corporate-owned mobile devices at a time. DEM accounts are useful in organizations that enroll and prepare devices before handing them out to users. | 
| [Identify devices as corporate-owned](../enrollment/corporate-identifiers-add.md)| You can assign corporate-owned status to devices to enable more management and identification capabilities in Intune. Corporate-owned status cannot be assigned to devices enrolled through Apple Business Manager. | 
|[Change device ownership](../enrollment/corporate-identifiers-add.md#change-device-ownership)|After a device has been enrolled, you can change its ownership label in Intune to corporate-owned or personal-owned. This adjustment changes the way you can manage the device.|  
|[Troubleshoot enrollment problems](/troubleshoot/mem/intune/troubleshoot-device-enrollment-in-intune)|Troubleshoot and find resolutions to problems that occur during enrollment. |

## Create compliance rules  

Create compliance policies to define the rules and conditions that users and devices must meet to access your protected resources. This is how you ensure that devices accessing your data meet your standards. Intune marks devices that fall short of your requirements as *noncompliant* and takes action (such as sending the user a notification, restricting access, or wiping the device) according to your configurations.  

If you create a Conditional Access policy, it can work alongside your device compliance results to block access to resources from noncompliant devices. For a detailed explanation about compliance policies and how to get started, see [Use compliance policies to set rules for devices you manage with Intune](../protect/device-compliance-get-started.md).  

| Task | Detail | 
| ---- | ------ | 
| [Create a compliance policy](../protect/create-compliance-policy.md)|Get step-by-step guidance on how to create and assign a compliance policy to user and device groups.   |       
| [Add actions for noncompliance](../protect/actions-for-noncompliance.md) |Choose what happens when devices no longer meet the conditions of your compliance policy. You can add actions for noncompliance when you configure a device compliance policy, or later by editing the policy.    |  
| Create [a device-based](../protect/create-conditional-access-intune.md) or [app-based](../protect/app-based-conditional-access-intune-create.md) Conditional Access policy| Specify the app or services you want to protect and define the conditions for access. |  
|[Block access to apps that don't use modern authentication](../protect/app-modern-authentication-block.md)  | Create an app-based Conditional Access policy to block apps that use authentication methods other than OAuth2; for example, those apps that use basic and form-based authentication. Before you block access, however, sign in to Microsoft Entra ID and review the [authentication methods activity report](/azure/active-directory/authentication/howto-authentication-methods-activity) to see if users are using basic authentication to access essential things you forgot about or are unaware of.  For example, things like meeting room calendar kiosks use basic authentication.  |  


## Configure device settings     

Use Microsoft Intune to enable or disable settings and features on macOS devices being used for work.  To configure and enforce these settings, create a device configuration profile and then assign the profile to groups in your organization.
