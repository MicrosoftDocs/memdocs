# Step 3: Create a group to manage users

In this article, you'll use Intune to create a group based on an existing user. Groups are used to manage your users and control your employees' access to your company resources. These resources can be part of your company's intranet or can be external resources, such as SharePoint sites, SaaS apps, or web apps.

[!INCLUDE [intune-evaluate](../includes/intune-evaluate.md)]

If you don't have an Intune subscription, [sign up for a free trial account](free-trial-sign-up.md).

>[!NOTE]
>Intune provides pre-created **All Users** and **All Devices** groups in the console with built-in optimizations for your convenience.

## Prerequisites

- Microsoft Intune subscription - [sign up for a free trial account](../fundamentals/free-trial-sign-up.md).
- To complete this step, you must [create a user](quickstart-create-user.md).

## Sign in to the Microsoft Intune admin center

Sign in to [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431) as an [Intune administrator](../fundamentals/users-add.md#types-of-administrators). If you've created an Intune Trial subscription, the account you created the subscription with is the Global administrator.

## Create a group

You'll create a group that will be used later in this evaluation series. To create a group:

1. Once you've opened the [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431), select **Groups** > **New group**.
2. In the **Group type** dropdown box, select **Security**.
3. In the **Group name** field, enter the name for the new group (for example, **Contoso Testers**).
4. Add a **Group description** for the group.
5. Set the **Membership type** to **Assigned**. 
6. Under **Members**, select the link and add one or more members for the group from the list.

7. Click **Select** > **Create**.

Once you've successfully created the group, it will appear in the list of **All groups**.
