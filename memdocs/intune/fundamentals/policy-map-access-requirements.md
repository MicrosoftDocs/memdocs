# Access requirements policy mapping from Basic Mobility and Security to Intune

This article provides mapping details between Basic Mobility and Security to Intune. Specifically, this page maps Office 365 Security and Compliance portal Access Requirement policies to the equivalent policies in Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center. Because Intune offers more flexibility, each Office policy will translate into multiple Intune and Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) policies to achieve the same result.

If you’re migrating from Basic Mobility and Security to Intune, you can use the [Migration evaluation tool](migrate-to-intune.md) to automate much of this mapping.

To see these settings in the Office 365 Security and Compliance portal, sign in to the portal at https://protection.office.com/devicev2 and under the list of **Device security policies** select policy name > **Edit policy** > **Access Requirements**.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The **If a device doesn't meet the requirements above, then...** setting determines if you should use Intune compliance policies or configuration profiles for all access requirement settings. Make sure to review the details for this setting first.

## If a device doesn't meet the requirements above, then...
This setting determines if you should use compliance policies or configuration profiles in Intune for all the access requirement settings.

> [!NOTE]
> Basic Mobility and Security never supported enforcing conditional access on Windows.

### Allow access and report violation (one-time enrollment will still be enforced)
All Access Requirements will be deployed in an Intune device configuration profile.

### Block access and report violation
All Access Requirements will be deployed in an Intune compliance policy and the groups assigned will also be assigned to classic conditional access policies:
- [GraphAggregatorService] Device policy
- [Office 365 Exchange Online] Device policy
- [Outlook Service for Exchange] Device policy
- [Office 365 SharePoint Online] Device policy
- [Outlook Service for OneDrive] Device policy.

## Require a password

> [!NOTE]
> All password-related settings only impact local accounts on Windows. User accounts sourced from Azure Active Directory are not managed by these policies.

[!INCLUDE [blockorallow](../includes/block-or-allow.md)]

Three compliance policies:
- **Devices** > **Windows** > **Compliance policies** > policy name_O365_W > **Properties** >  **Compliance settings Edit** > **System Security** > **Require a password to unlock mobile devices**
- **Devices** > **iOS/iPadOS** > **Compliance policies** > policy name_O365_i > **Properties** > **Compliance settings Edit** > **System Security** > **Require a password to unlock mobile devices**
- **Devices** > **Android** > **Compliance policies** > policy name_O365_A > **Properties** > **Compliance settings Edit** > **System Security** > **Require a password to unlock mobile devices**

## Prevent simple passwords
For Android devices, this setting and multiple other Office settings are covered by one Android compliance setting. So this setting alone doesn't determine a specific Android compliance value.

[!INCLUDE [blockorallow](../includes/block-or-allow.md)]

Three compliance policies:
- **Devices** > **Windows** > **Compliance policies** > policy name_O365_W > **Properties** >  **Compliance settings Edit** > **System Security** > **Simple passwords**
- **Devices** > **iOS/iPadOS** > **Compliance policies** > policy name_O365_i > **Properties** > **Compliance settings Edit** > **System Security** > **Simple passwords**
- **Devices** > **Android** > **Compliance policies** > policy name_O365_A > **Properties** > **Compliance settings Edit** > **System Security** > **Required password type**.
    - If **Prevent simple passwords** is selected, choose **Numeric complex**, **Alphabetic**, **Alphanumeric**, or **Alphanumeric with symbols** (based on other Office settings).
    - If **Prevent simple passwords** isn't selected, choose **Numeric** or a higher type in the list (based on other Office settings).

## Require an alphanumeric password

For Android devices, this setting and multiple other Office settings are covered by one Android compliance setting. So this setting alone doesn't determine a specific Android compliance value.

[!INCLUDE [blockorallow](../includes/block-or-allow.md)]

Three compliance policies:
- **Devices** > **Windows** > **Compliance policies** > policy name_O365_W > **Properties** >  **Compliance settings Edit** > **System Security** > **Required password type**
- **Devices** > **iOS/iPadOS** > **Compliance policies** > policy name_O365_i > **Properties** > **Compliance settings Edit** > **System Security** > **Required password type**
- **Devices** > **Android** > **Compliance policies** > policy name_O365_A > **Properties** > **Compliance settings Edit** > **System Security** > **Required password type**.
    - If **Prevent simple passwords** is selected, choose **Numeric complex**, **Alphabetic**, **Alphanumeric**, or **Alphanumeric with symbols** (based on other Office settings).
    - If **Prevent simple passwords** isn't selected, choose **Numeric** or a higher type in the list (based on other Office settings).

## Password must include at least [1-4] character sets

[!INCLUDE [blockorallow](../includes/block-or-allow.md)]

Four compliance policies:
- **Devices** > **Windows** > **Compliance policies** > policy name_O365_W > **Properties** >  **Compliance settings Edit** > **System Security** > **Password complexity**. 

    | Office value | Intune value |
    | --- | --- |
    | 1 | **Require digits and lowercase letters**. The Windows compliance policy doesn’t allow only one character set, so an Office setting of **1** translates to **Require digits and lowercase letters**. |
    | 2 | **Require digits and lowercase letters** |
    | 3 | **Require digits, lowercase and uppercase letters** |
    | 4 | **Require digits, lowercase, uppercase, and special characters** |

- **Devices** > **iOS/iPadOS** > **Compliance policies** > policy name_O365_i > **Properties** > **Compliance settings Edit** > **System Security** > **Number of non-alphanumeric characters in password**. The iOS compliance policy doesn’t enforce the number of character sets but only the number of non-alphanumeric characters that must be used. So Office values are translated to the same number of non-alphanumeric characters required. 

    | Office value | Intune value |
    | --- | --- |
    | Disabled (0) | Not configured |
    | 1 | 1 |
    | 2 | 2 |
    | 3 | 3 |
    | 4 | 4 |

- **Devices** > **Android** > **Compliance policies** > policy name_O365_A > **Properties** > **Compliance settings Edit** > **System Security** > **Required password type**. Android doesn’t support distinguishing lowercase and uppercase as different character sets, and so the Office value of 4 cannot be enforced. Instead it translates to at least **Alphanumeric with symbols**.

    | Office value | Intune value |
    | --- | --- |
    | 1 | At least **Numeric** or **Numeric complex** (based on other Office settings) |
    | 2 | At least **Alphanumeric** |
    | 3 | At least **Alphanumeric with symbols** |
    | 4 | At least **Alphanumeric with symbols** |

- policy-name_OfficeMDM > **Access controls** > **Grant** > **Require device to be marked as compliant**

## Minimum password length

[!INCLUDE [blockorallow](../includes/block-or-allow.md)]

Three compliance policies:
- **Devices** > **Windows** > **Compliance policies** > policy name_O365_W > **Properties** >  **Compliance settings Edit** > **System Security** > **Minimum password length**
- **Devices** > **iOS/iPadOS** > **Compliance policies** > policy name_O365_i > **Properties** > **Compliance settings Edit** > **System Security** > **Minimum password length**
- **Devices** > **Android** > **Compliance policies** > policy name_O365_A > **Properties** > **Compliance settings Edit** > **System Security** > **Required password type** and **Minimum password length**.

    | Office value for **Require an alphanumeric password** | Intune value for **Required password type** |
    | --- | --- |
    | Selected | At least **Numeric** (based on other Office settings) |
    | Not selected | At least **Numeric** (based on other Office settings) |

## Number of sign-in failures before the device is wiped
Although this setting is listed under **Access requirements** in Basic Mobility and Security, access is still allowed even if this setting hasn't yet been enabled on the device, and this setting isn't a device compliance criterion.

[!INCLUDE [blockorallow](../includes/block-or-allow.md)]

Three configuration profiles:

- **Devices** > **Windows** > **Configuration profiles** > policy name_O365_W > **Properties** >  **Compliance settings Edit** > **Password** > **Number of sign-in failures before wiping device**
- **Devices** > **iOS/iPadOS** > **Configuration profiles** > policy name_O365_i > **Properties** >  **Compliance settings Edit** > **Password** > **Number of sign-in failures before wiping device**
- **Devices** > **Android** > **Configuration profiles** > policy name_O365_A > **Properties** >  **Compliance settings Edit** > **Password** > **Number of sign-in failures before wiping device**

## Lock devices if they are inactive for this many minutes

The Windows, iOS/iPadOS, and Android compliance policies don’t offer the same granularity of values, so the Office setting range is mapped to fewer Intune values.

Three compliance policies:
- **Devices** > **Windows** > **Compliance policies** > policy name_O365_W > **Properties** >  **Compliance settings Edit** > **System Security** > **Maximum minutes of inactivity before password is required**

    | Office value | Intune value |
    | --- | --- |
    | 1 through 4 | 1 minute |
    | 5 through 14 | 5 minutes |
    | 15 or more | 15 minutes |

- **Devices** > **iOS/iPadOS** > **Compliance policies** > policy name_O365_i > **Properties** > **Compliance settings Edit** > **System Security** > **Maximum minutes of inactivity before password is required**

    | Office value | Intune value |
    | --- | --- |
    | 1  | 1 minute |
    | 2  | 2 minutes |
    | 3  | 3 minutes |
    | 4  | 4 minutes |
    | 5 through 9 | 5 minutes (maximum for iOS) |
    | 10 through 14 | 10 minutes (iPadOS only) |
    | 15 or more | 15 minutes (iPadOS only) |

- **Devices** > **Android** > **Compliance policies** > policy name_O365_A > **Properties** > **Compliance settings Edit** > **System Security** > **Required password type**.

    | Office value | Intune value |
    | --- | --- |
    | 1 through 4 | 1 minute |
    | 5 through 14 | 5 minutes |
    | 15 through 29 | 15 minutes |
    | 30 through 59 | 30 minutes |
    | 60 | 60 minutes |

## Password expiration

[!INCLUDE [blockorallow](../includes/block-or-allow.md)]

Three compliance policies:
- **Devices** > **Windows** > **Compliance policies** > policy name_O365_W > **Properties** >  **Compliance settings Edit** > **System Security** > **Password expiration (days)**
- **Devices** > **iOS/iPadOS** > **Compliance policies** > policy name_O365_i > **Properties** > **Compliance settings Edit** > **System Security** > **Password expiration (days)**
- **Devices** > **Android** > **Compliance policies** > policy name_O365_A > **Properties** > **Compliance settings Edit** > **System Security** > **Number of days until password expires**.

## Remember password history and prevent reuse

[!INCLUDE [blockorallow](../includes/block-or-allow.md)]

Three compliance policies:
- **Devices** > **Windows** > **Compliance policies** > policy name_O365_W > **Properties** >  **Compliance settings Edit** > **System Security** > **Number of previous passwords to prevent reuse**
- **Devices** > **iOS/iPadOS** > **Compliance policies** > policy name_O365_i > **Properties** > **Compliance settings Edit** > **System Security** > **Number of previous passwords to prevent reuse**
- **Devices** > **Android** > **Compliance policies** > policy name_O365_A > **Properties** > **Compliance settings Edit** > **System Security** > **Number of previous passwords to prevent reuse** and **Required password type**

    | Office value for **Require an alphanumeric password** | Intune value for **Required password type** |
    | --- | --- |
    | Selected | At least **Numeric** (based on other Office settings) |
    | Not selected | At least **Numeric** (based on other Office settings) |

## Require data encryption on devices

This setting was never configurable for Windows or iOS/iPadOS in Basic Mobility and Security.

[!INCLUDE [blockorallow](../includes/block-or-allow.md)]

One compliance policy:
- **Devices** > **Android** > **Compliance policies** > policy name_O365_A > **Properties** > **Compliance settings Edit** > **System Security** > **Encryption of data storage on device**

## Prevent jail broken or rooted devices from connecting

This setting was never configurable for Windows in Basic Mobility and Security.

For Android devices, Intune only supports this setting for Android device administrator devices.

[!INCLUDE [blockorallow](../includes/block-or-allow.md)]

Two compliance policies:
- **Devices** > **iOS/iPadOS** > **Compliance policies** > policy name_O365_i > **Properties** > **Compliance settings Edit** > **Device Health** > **Jailbroken devices**
- **Devices** > **Android** > **Compliance policies** > policy name_O365_A > **Properties** > **Compliance settings Edit** > **Device Health** > **Rooted devices**

## Require managing email profile (required for selective wipe on iOS)
Requiring this setting was never supported for Windows or Android compliance in Basic Mobility and Security.
Windows email was never supported for Windows 10 in Basic Mobility and Security.

For Android, this setting was only supported on Samsung Knox devices in Basic Mobility and Security.

Intune requires additional settings be configured when deploying email that weren’t available in device security policies. For more information, see [Additional settings required by Intune for email profiles](#additional-settings-required-by-intune-for-email-profiles).

[!INCLUDE [blockorallow](../includes/block-or-allow.md)]

Three configuration profiles and one compliance policy
- **Devices** > **Windows** > **Configuration profiles** > policy name_O365_W_Email > **Properties** > **Configuration settings Edit**

    | Setting | Value |
    | --- | --- |
    | Email server | outlook.office365.com |
    | Account name | Office 365 email |
    | Username attribute from AAD | User Principal Name |
