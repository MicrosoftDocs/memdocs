# Basic setup

After you assess your environment, it's time to set up Microsoft Intune.

## External dependencies for an Intune deployment

### Identity

Intune requires Azure Active Directory (AAD) as the identity and user grouping provider. Learn more about:

- [Identity requirements](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-hybrid-identity-design-considerations-overview#design-considerations-overview)

- [Directory synchronization requirements](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-hybrid-identity-design-considerations-directory-sync-requirements)

- [Multi-factor authentication (MFA)](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/authentication/concept-mfa-howitworks)

- [Planning your user and device groups](users-add.md)

- [How to create user and device groups](groups-get-started.md)

If your organization is already using Office 365, Intune must use the same Azure Active Directory environment.

### PKI (optional)

If you're planning to use certificate-based authentication for VPN, Wi-Fi, or e-mail profiles with Intune, you'll need to make sure that you have a supported [PKI infrastructure in place](../protect/certificates-configure.md), ready to create and deploy certificate profiles. Learn more about configuring certificates in Intune:

- [How to configure the certificate infrastructure for SCEP](/intune/certificates-scep-configure)

- [How to configure the certificate infrastructure for PFX](/intune/certficates-pfx-configure).

## Task list for an Intune setup

### Task 1: Intune subscription

Before you can migrate to Intune, you first need an [Intune subscription](account-sign-up.md).

### Task 2: Assign Intune user licenses

- Learn [how to assign Intune user licenses](licenses-assign.md).

- If you have created a new Azure Active Directory tenant, learn [how to create new users or sync user from your on-premises Active Directory (AD).](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/connect/active-directory-aadconnect)

### Task 3: Set your MDM authority to Intune

We recommend that you manage Intune using the [Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431).

Set your MDM authority to **Intune**. Using a different MDM authority allows Intune to transfer MDM management to alternate Microsoft management consoles. These cases are uncommon.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you are transferring your mobile device management to Intune for the first time, you should set the MDM authority to Intune.

Learn [how to set the mobile management authority](mdm-authority-set.md).

## Next step

Configure [device and app management policies](migration-guide-configure-policies.md).
