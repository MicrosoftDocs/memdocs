# Microsoft Intune for US Government GCC High and DoD service description

> [!NOTE]
> This article applies to Microsoft Intune features only. If you're looking for information on other features, then go to that specific documentation. For example, for Microsoft Teams devices, go to [Teams Rooms on Windows and Android](/microsoftteams/rooms/teams-devices-feature-comparison).

The Intune U.S. government service description is as an overview of the service offering in the GCC High and DoD environments. It lists the feature differences compared to the commercial offering of Microsoft Intune.

To learn more about Intune for GCC customers, go to [EMS offers for US Government and Microsoft 365 interoperability](/enterprise-mobility-security/solutions/ems-govt-service-description#ems-offers-for-us-government-and-microsoft-365-interoperability).

> [!TIP]
> For information on the US Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) accreditation and Microsoft, go to [FedRAMP](/compliance/regulatory/offering-fedramp).

## Get started with Intune for US Government GCC High and DoD

The Intune GCC High and DoD offering are built on the Microsoft Azure Government Cloud. It's designed to interoperate with Microsoft 365 GCC High and DoD environments.

For more information about Intune, and what you can do, go to [Microsoft Intune securely manages identities, manages apps, and manages devices](what-is-intune.md). Use this documentation as your starting point for deploying and using Microsoft Intune.

Intune has two service instances:

- **Commercial service**: The commercial service is available to anyone with an Intune license and is used by most Intune customers.
- **Government cloud**: This service is also known as **GCC High** or **DoD**. This instance is a datacenter that's physically separate from the commercial instances. The datacenter is locked down and is only used by government customers who purchase the appropriate license.

These government instances are also known as **IL4** and **IL5**, where **IL** refers to Impact Level.

### What you need to know

- There isn't a built-in way to migrate from the commercial service to the government cloud, and vice versa. To migrate, devices need to unenroll from the current tenant, and then re-enroll to the new tenant.

  This approach is similar to unenrolling from another MDM service and enrolling in Intune. For more information, go to [Deployment guide: Setup or move to Microsoft Intune](deployment-guide-intune-setup.md#currently-use-a-third-party-mdm-provider).

- In the government cloud, the Intune service instance is shared with GCC High and DoD tenants. This architecture is slightly different than other services, such as Microsoft 365 and Azure.

- For Intune, there isn't a "GCC" instance. Other services offer a "GCC" instance. GCC instances are commonly used by state and local government customers that require extra accreditation for the cloud services they use.
