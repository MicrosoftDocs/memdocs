# Supported operating systems and browsers in Intune

Before setting up Microsoft Intune, review the supported operating systems and browsers.

For more information on configuration service provider support, visit the [Configuration service provider reference](/windows/client-management/mdm/configuration-service-provider-reference).  

## Intune supported operating systems

Intune supports devices running the following operating systems (OS):

* Android
* iOS/iPadOS
* Linux
* macOS
* Windows
* Chrome OS  

[!INCLUDE [mdm-supported-devices](../includes/mdm-supported-devices.md)]

### Supported platforms for Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Integration

For more information, see [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint on devices with Microsoft Intune](../protect/mde-security-integration.md)

### Supported Samsung Knox Standard devices  

Microsoft Intune only attempts Samsung Knox activation during enrollment on supported Knox devices. Devices that don't support Samsung Knox enroll as standard Android devices. For a list of devices that support Samsung Knox, see [Devices secured by Knox](https://www.samsungknox.com/knox-supported-devices/knox-workspace) on the Samsung Knox website. It's important to look for your device model number when verifying support, because some device models support Knox while others don't. Always verify Knox compatibility with your device reseller before you buy and deploy Samsung devices.  

> [!NOTE]
> You may need to enable access to Samsung servers to enroll Samsung Knox devices. For more information about enrollment, see [Automatically enroll Android devices by using Samsung's Knox Mobile Enrollment](../enrollment/android-samsung-knox-mobile-enroll.md).  

The Samsung device models in the following table don't support Knox solutions and features. Intune enrolls them as native Android devices.
