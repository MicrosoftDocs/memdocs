# List of platforms, policies, and app types supported by filters in Microsoft Intune

When you create an app, compliance policy, configuration profile, or app configuration policy, you assign the policy to groups (users or devices). When you assign the policy, you can also use filters. For example, you can assign policies to Windows client devices running a specific OS version. For more information, see [Use filters when assigning your apps, policies, and profiles](filters.md).

Filters support some of the different workloads available in Microsoft Intune. This article lists the app types, compliance policies, device configuration profiles, and app configuration policies that support filters. It also lists the workloads that aren't supported.

## Before you begin

- This article assume you're familiar with filters. If not, you can learn more at [Use filters when assigning your apps, policies, and profiles](filters.md).
- ✔️: Supports filters.
