# List of platforms, policies, and app types supported by filters in Microsoft Intune

When you create an app, compliance policy, device configuration profile, or app configuration policy, you assign the policy to groups (users or devices). When you assign the policy, you can also use [filters](filters.md). For example, you can assign policies to Windows client devices running a specific OS version.

You can use filters on **managed devices** (devices enrolled in Intune) and **managed apps** (apps managed by Intune).

Filters support some of the different workloads available in Microsoft Intune. This article lists the app types, compliance policies, device configuration profiles, and app configuration policies that support filters. It also lists the workloads that aren't supported.

This article assumes you're familiar with filters. If not, learn more at [Use filters when assigning your apps, policies, and profiles](filters.md).

## Before you begin

- ✅: Supports filters.
- ❌: Doesn't support filters.
- N/A: Doesn't apply to the platform.

## Supported app types for managed devices

You can use filters for some common app policies on the following platforms. For a list of what's not supported on managed devices, go to [not supported](#not-supported-on-managed-devices) (in this article).
