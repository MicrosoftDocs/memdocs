# Compare managing Windows PCs as computers or mobile devices

[!INCLUDE [classic-portal](../includes/classic-portal.md)]

Organizations can use Microsoft Intune to manage Windows PCs either as mobile devices with mobile device management (MDM) or as computers with the Intune software client.  Microsoft recommends that customers use the MDM management solution whenever possible. To help you better understand the differences between these options, however, the following chart compares the two management options.
