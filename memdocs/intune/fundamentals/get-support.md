# How to get support for Microsoft Intune

Microsoft provides global technical, pre-sales, billing, and subscription support for Microsoft Intune. Support is available both online and by phone for paid and trial subscriptions. Online technical support is available in English and Japanese. Phone support and online billing support are available in additional languages.

As an Intune admin, you can use the **Help and Support** option to file an on-line support ticket for Intune from the Azure portal. To create and manage a support incident, your account must have an Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) role that includes the *action* **microsoft.office365.supportTickets**. For information about Azure AD roles and permissions that are required to create a support ticket, see [administrator roles in Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-assign-admin-roles-azure-portal).

>[!IMPORTANT]
> For technical support with third-party products that work with Intune (like Saaswedo, Cisco, or Lookout), contact the supplier of that product first. Before you open a request with Intune support, make sure you configured the other product correctly.
>
> For information about troubleshooting issues related to Microsoft Intune, see the [Troubleshoot section](help-desk-operators.md) of the Intune documentation.

## Help and support experience

The Help and support experience for Intune is available from the [Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431) and from all of the blades (or pages) under Intune in the Azure portal.

The *Help and support* experience is similar to the experience seen in the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com/), and replaces the previous *Help + support*, which remains in place for other services in Azure.

> [!TIP]
> Starting November 18, 2019, an updated and streamlined in-console experience for getting help and support is rolling out to tenants. If this new experience isn't available for you yet, it will be soon.

### Options to access Help and support

When you use a newly created tenant for Intune, it's possible that *Help and Support* fails to open and the following message is returned:

- *We encountered an unknown problem. Please refresh the page but if the problem persists, please create a case through [M365 Admin Center](https://admin.microsoft.com) and reference the session ID provided.*

The error details include a *Session ID*, *Extension* details, and more.

This problem occurs when you have not authenticated your new tenant account through either the **M365 Admin Center** at https://admin.microsoft.com, or the **Office 365  portal** at https://portal.office.com. To resolve this problem, select the link for *M365 Admin Center* in the message, or visit https://portal.office.com, and sign in. Following authentication at either site, *Help and Support* for Intune becomes accessible.

**Access Help and Support**:

- **In the Azure portal**

  - Select **Help and support** from any Intune blade or page.

  > [!NOTE]  
  > If your instance of Intune is hosted on the private cloud for government, also known as a sovereign cloud like Azure Government, see [Intune support for private cloud for government](#intune-support-for-private-cloud-for-government), later in this article. The Intune *Help and support* experience won't be available on the private cloud for government until next year.

- **From the Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center**

  - From any node in the Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center, select the **?** icon in the upper-right corner of the portal, and then use the drop-down to select the management type you want help with. The Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center supports the following management types, and you must select the one you want assistance for, like Intune:

    - Configure Manager (includes Desktop Analytics)
    - Intune
    - Co-management  

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Select your management type](./media/get-support/select-management-type.png)

    After you select a management type, the *Help and support* page opens where you can then specify details to [find solutions](#find-solutions) for a specific problem. Details are filtered based on the type of management you select.

     If the right management type wasn't selected **(1)**, click on *Select a management type* **(2)** to return to the management type selection drop-down:

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Confirm your management type](./media/get-support/confirm-management-selection.png)

  - If you open Help and support from **Troubleshooting + support** > **Help and support**, you won't see the management type you selected listed below *Help and support*.

  - If you drill into any other node like *Devices*, *Apps*, or *Users*, and then select *Help and support*, you won't have the opportunity to select a management type nor will the type display below *Help and support*. In this case, *Intune* is assumed. If you don't want the context to be Intune, use the **?** option so you can select a different management type.

### The support experience

  When you open Help and Support, the portal displays the **Need help?** window:

  ![View the need help window](./media/get-support/need-help.png)

  In the left top corner there are three icons that you can select to open different panes of the *Need Help?* window. The pane your viewing is identified by the underline.

  Customers with a **Premier** or **Unified** support contract have [additional options](#premier-and-unified-support-customers) for support, and see a banner in *Need help?* that resembles the following image:
  ![Premier banner](./media/get-support/premier-banner.png)

  *Need Help?* opens to the *Find Solutions* pane. However, if you have an active support case the window opens to the *Service requests* pane where you can view details about your active and closed support cases.

#### Find solutions

![Select the find solutions pane](./media/get-support/find-solutions.png)

On the *Find solutions* pane, specify a few details about an issue in the provided text box. Based on the text you provide about an issue, the pane populates with insights that are potential matches. You'll also get links to recommended articles that might help you resolve the issue.

When a strong match is found for the details you describe, troubleshooting tips can appear right in the *Need help?* window.

For example, you might enter **Password synchronization errors**. The results include troubleshooting guidance directly in the pane, and links to recommended articles from our documentation library.

![View troubleshooting insights](./media/get-support/troubleshooting-insights.png)

#### Contact support

![Select the contact support pane](./media/get-support/contact-support.png)

From the *contact support* pane, you can submit a request for assistance. This pane is available after you provide some basic keywords on the *find solutions* pane.

When requesting assistance, provide a description of the problem with as much detail as needed.  After confirming your phone and email contact information, select the method of contact you prefer. The window displays a response time for each contact method, which gives you an expectation of when you'll be contacted. Before submitting your request, attach files like logs or screenshots that can help fill in details about the issue.

![Contact support form](./media/get-support/contact-support-form.png)

After you fill in the required information, select **Contact me** to submit the request.

#### Service requests

![Select the service requests pane](./media/get-support/service-requests.png)

The *Service requests* pane displays your case history. Active cases are at the top of the list, with closed issues also available for review.

![View your service request list](./media/get-support/service-requests-pane.png)

If you have an active support case number, you can enter it here to jump to that issue, or you can select any incident from the list of active and closed incidents to view more information about it.

When you're done viewing details for an incident, select the left arrow that appears at the top of the service request window just above the icons for the three *Need Help?* pane icons. The back arrow returns the display to the list of support incidents you've opened.

#### Premier and Unified support customers

As a customer with a **Premier** or **Unified** support contract, you can specify a severity for your issue, and schedule a support callback for a specific time and day. These options are available when you open or submit a new issue and when you edit an active support case.

**Severity** - The options to specify the severity of an issue depend on your support contract:

- *Premier*: Severity of A, B, or C
- *Unified*: Critical, or non-critical

Selecting either a severity **A** or **Critical** issue limits you to a phone support case, which provides the fastest option to get support.

**Callback schedule** - You can request a callback on a specific day and time.

## Azure Help + support experience

You can no longer use the Azure *Help + support* experience to get assistance with Intune, unless your subscription is on a private cloud for government.
If your instance of Intune doesn't run on a private cloud for government, navigating through Azure *Help + support* redirects you to the Intune *Help and support* experience to create and manage support incidents:

When you use the left navigation pane **Help + support**, or use the **?** option to open the *Help* pane and then select **Help + support**, you open the Azure *Help + support* page.

From this page select **+ New support request** to open the *Basics* tab of the *Help + support + New support request* page.

![Help + support](./media/get-support/help-plus-support.png)

On this page:

- For *Issue type*, select  **Technical**.
- For *Service*, select **Microsoft Intune**.

  You are then presented with a link that redirects you to the [Intune Help and Support page](https://aka.ms/intunehelpsupport).

## Intune support for private cloud for government

When your Intune subscription hosted on the private cloud for government, which is also known as a sovereign cloud like Azure Government, you don't yet have access to the newer Intune Help and support experience.  Instead, use the following information go get support for Intune.

### Create an online support ticket

>[!IMPORTANT]
> As *Help and support* transitions to a new system which is not yet available for the private cloud for government, when you create a support incident, the portal identifies a support case that uses a 15 digit identification number. When the 15-digit case is created, a mirror of that case is created for use by Microsoft Support. This mirror case is created in a new support system, uses an 8-digit case ID, and is used by support services to track all work and communications for your support incident. Shortly after your 15-digit case is created, you'll receive an email that identifies the 8-digit number of the mirrored support case that is used by support services.
>
> Support personal work and communicate from the 8-digit support case, and only use the 8-digit support case to log communications and track incident progress. Therefore, you'll receive email updates from that 8-digit support case that serve as your case-work track record. No details are logged into the 15-digit support incident. When support concludes and the 8-digit support case closes, that status is reflected in by the 15-digit support case that you can view from within the azure portal.  No other updates or status changes should be expected for the 15-digit support case.
>
> When transitions between support tools completes later this year, the support experience Intune hosted on the government cloud will resemble the default *Help and support* experience that's currently available for Intune subscriptions hosted on the public cloud.

1. Sign in to the Azure portal (<https://portal.azure.us>) with your Intune admin credentials, select the **?** icon in the upper-right corner of the portal, and then select **Help + support** to go to the [Azure Help + support](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Support/HelpAndSupportBlade/overview) page.

   ![Image of the question mark link with the Help + support link highlighted](./media/get-support/azure-get-support.png)

2. On the Azure **Help + support** page, select **New support request**.

   ![Image of New support request link highlighted on the help and support page](./media/get-support/azure-support-ticket-link.png)

3. On the **Basics** tab, for most Intune technical support issues, choose the following options:
   - **Issue type**: **Technical**
   - **Subscription**: <*your subscription*>
   - **Service**: **Microsoft Intune**
   - **Problem type**: Choose your problem type from the drop-down menu.
   - **Problem subtype**: Choose the problem subtype from the drop-down menu.
   - **Subject**: Briefly describe the issue you want help with.

   ![Image of the basics tab on the Help + support - New support request page](./media/get-support/help-new-support-case-basics.png)

   Choose **Next: Solutions** to continue.
4. On the **Solutions** tab, review the recommended steps that might help you solve your problem without filing a ticket. If you still want to create a support request after looking through the steps, click **Next: Details**.

   ![Image of the solutions tab on the Help + support - New support request page](./media/get-support/help-new-support-case-solutions.png)
5. On the **Details** tab, fill out the details for your problem, the support method, your contact information, and then click **Next: Review + create**.

   ![Image of the details tab on the Help + support - New support request page](./media/get-support/help-new-support-case-details.png)
6. Review the information, verify that it's correct, and then choose **Create** to submit your support request.

   ![Image of the review + create tab on the New support request page](./media/get-support/help-new-support-case-create.png)

>[!IMPORTANT]
>If you have a billing or subscription question, you can open a case to get support through the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com/Support/SupportEntry.aspx).

### View support requests  

You can view your support requests from within the Azure portal. However, limited information is available.  To view your incidents:

1. Sign in to  Azure (<https://portal.azure.com>) with your Intune admin credentials, select the **?** icon in the upper-right corner of the portal, and then select **Help + support** to go to the [Azure Help + support](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Support/HelpAndSupportBlade/overview) page.

2. On the **Help + support** page, you can view the list of **Recent support requests**.

   > [!IMPORTANT]  
   > Private cloud for government customers can only view the 15-digit support case number, and the incident status. All case communications and tracking of work or alerts are sent by email and reference the 8-digit support case number that is created as a mirror of the support case opened from within the Intune console.
