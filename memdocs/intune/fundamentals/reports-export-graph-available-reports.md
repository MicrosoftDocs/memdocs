# Intune reports and properties available using Graph API

Microsoft Intune provides many reports in the Microsoft Intune admin center that can be exported using Graph APIs. Microsoft Graph is a RESTful web API that enables you to access Microsoft Cloud service resources. To export Intune reports, you must use the Microsoft Graph API to make a set of HTTP calls. For more information, see [Export Intune reports using Graph APIs](../fundamentals/reports-export-graph-apis.md).

> [!NOTE]
> Intune reports that have been migrated to a new [Intune reporting infrastructure](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/intune-customer-success/new-reporting-framework-coming-to-intune/ba-p/1009553#:~:text=New%20Reporting%20Framework%20Coming%20to%20Intune%20%20,Device%20compliance%20logging%20%203%20more%20rows), will be available for export from a single top-level export Graph API.
>
> For more information about making REST API calls, including tools for interacting with Microsoft Graph, see [Use the Microsoft Graph API](/graph/use-the-api).

Microsoft Intune will export reports using the following Microsoft Graph API endpoint:

```http
https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/deviceManagement/reports/exportJobs
```

The following table contains the possible values for the `reportName` parameter. These are the currently available reports for export.

### Generate the ChromeOSDevices report

You can generate the ChromeOSDevices report using the Microsoft Graph API to make the HTTP call. Microsoft Graph is a RESTful web API that enables you to access Microsoft Cloud service resources.

| Microsoft Graph API Endpoint | Method | Body examples |
|---|---|---|
| `https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/deviceManagement/reports/exportJobs` | POST | The following examples show different types of calls you can make based on the data you need to retrieve. This list is not comprehensive.<ul><li>Return all devices using CSV format:<br>`{ 'reportName': 'ChromeOSDevices', 'format': 'csv' }`</li><li>Return all devices using JSON format:<br>`{ 'reportName': 'ChromeOSDevices', 'format': 'json' }`</li><li>Use a filter:<br>`{ 'reportName': 'ChromeOSDevices', 'filter':'(ChromeOSDeviceStatus eq  'ACTIVE') ', 'format': 'csv' }`</li><li>Select which columns are included in the report:<br>`{ 'reportName': 'ChromeOSDevices', 'select':['IntuneDeviceId','IntuneDeviceName','MostRecentUserEmail']}`</li></ul>  |

### Check the status of the ChromeOSDevices report

You can check whether the ChromeOSDevices report has completed by using the Microsoft Graph API. 

| Microsoft Graph API Endpoint | Method | 
|---|---|
| `https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/deviceManagement/reports/exportJobs('id') ` | GET |

Use the output from the above call to determine the status of the ChromeOSDevices report. An example call will look similar to the following:
`https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/deviceManagement/reports/exportJobs('ChromeOSDevices_1223a321-4bcd-5432-efg1-0hi9876h1234') `

You can continue to run your call to check the status of the report. When the report shows a status of `complete`, your report is ready to be downloaded.

### Download the completed ChromeOSDevices report

You can download the completed ChromeOSDevices report by retrieving the `url` provided based on the same call you used to check the ChromeOSDevices report status. The download contains a zip file with the requested data that is formatted as CSV or JSON based on your selected format.
