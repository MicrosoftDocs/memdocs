# Unlicensed admins

You can give administrators access to Microsoft Endpoint Manager without them requiring an Intune license. This feature applies to any administrator, including Intune administrators, global administrators, Azure AD administrators, and so on. Other features or services, such as those in Azure Active Directory (AD) Premium, may require a license for the administrator.

## Allow access

1. Sign in to [Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431) > **Tenant administration** > **Roles** > **Administrator licensing**.
2. Select **Allow access to unlicensed admins** > **Yes**.

    > [!WARNING]
    > You can’t undo this setting after clicking **Yes**.

3. From now on, users who sign in to the Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center don’t require an Intune license. Their scope of access is defined by the roles assigned to them.

Intune supports up to 350 unlicensed admins per security group, and only applies to direct members. Admins above this limit will experience unpredictable behavior.

It can take up to 48 hours for access changes to take effect.
