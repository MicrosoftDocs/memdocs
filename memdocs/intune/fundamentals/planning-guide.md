# Intune deployment planning, design, and implementation guide

A successful Microsoft Intune deployment starts with having a good plan and design. The purpose of this guide is to step you through the process of developing a deployment plan, creating a design, onboarding Intune, and conducting a production rollout.

## What's included in this guide?

This guide includes sections that will walk you through the end-to-end process of deploying Intune. Start with Section 1 to clarify your goals, objectives, and challenges. Then move on to Sections 2 – 7 in the order that best meets your needs. You don't need to work through these sections sequentially; you can complete them in parallel.

- [Section 1: Determine deployment goals, objectives, and challenges](planning-guide-deployment-goals.md)

- [Section 2: Identify use case scenarios](planning-guide-scenarios.md)

- [Section 3: Determine use case requirements](planning-guide-requirements.md)

- [Section 4: Develop a rollout plan](planning-guide-rollout-plan.md)

- [Section 5: Develop a rollout communication plan](planning-guide-communication-plan.md)

- [Section 6: Develop a support plan](planning-guide-support-plan.md)

- [Section 7: Create an Intune design](planning-guide-design.md)

- [Section 8: Intune implementation](planning-guide-onboarding.md)

- [Section 9: Testing and validation](planning-guide-test-validation.md)

This guide also provides additional technical information and table templates that can be used to assist you with the Intune deployment planning, design, and implementation process.

### Additional resources

- [Microsoft Endpoint Manager Proof of Concept (PoC) guide:](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/partners/endpoint-manager-poc) this is intended to provide a framework and technical guidance on how to run a successful PoC within your organization.
- [Links and table templates](planning-guide-resources.md)

## Assumptions

- You've already evaluated Intune in a proof of concept (PoC) environment, and have decided to use it as the mobile device management solution in your organization.

- You're already familiar with Intune and its features.

## Next steps

Let's get started with the first section: [Determine deployment goals, objectives, and challenges](planning-guide-deployment-goals.md).
