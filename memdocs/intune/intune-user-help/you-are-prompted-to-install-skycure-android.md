# Install Symantec Endpoint Protection Mobile on your Android device

Before you can access your work, your company needs you to install the Symantec Endpoint Protection (SEP) Mobile app, which helps to protect your device by finding potential security threats.

If you have trouble with the installation, try the troubleshooting steps at the end of this topic.

## What you need to do

1. Drag down from the top of the screen to open the Notifications bar, and then tap **Required application – Install Skycure from Play Store**. You can also find this inside of the Company Portal app under __Compliance Details__.

2. You are taken to the SEP Mobile installation page in the Play Store. Install SEP Mobile, and then tap **ACCEPT** to let SEP Mobile access your device.

3. Open SEP Mobile, and then tap **VERIFY**.

4. Tap **Sign in with Azure Active Directory**, and then enter the account that you use to access work or school email and files.

5. Select the account that you use to access work or school email and files, and then tap **ADD ACCOUNT**.

6. Tap **Accept** to give SEP Mobile permission to sign you in and read your profile.

7. Review the items about how SEP Mobile protects your device, and then tap **OK**. SEP Mobile will take a few moments to set up, then will begin to check for security threats on your device.

8. SEP Mobile starts to check right away for security threats on your device.

   * If SEP Mobile finds a security threat on your device, you will see instructions about how to fix the issue.

   * If no threats are found, all three threat types will appear green.

     * The **Device Details** screen in the Company Portal shows that you are now in compliance with your company’s security requirements.

## If the installation doesn't work

Sometimes installations can fail due to technical issues beyond your control. If this happens, try installing SEP Mobile [manually from the Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.skycure.skycure).

Still need help? Contact your company support. For contact information, check the [Company Portal website](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2010980).
