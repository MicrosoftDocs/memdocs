# Enable security threat scans on your device 
If you unknowingly install an unsafe app, your device data may be at risk. To protect the data on your device, we recommend that you: 

* Only download apps from verified sources, such as the Google Play Store.  
* Enable security threat scans on your device. These scans are performed by Google and verify that apps are safe to install.  

To enable the scans on your device, go to **Settings** > **Google** > **Security**. Turn on **Scan device for security threats**.  

On some Samsung devices, you may find the setting in **Settings** > **Google** > **Security** > **Google Play Protect**.
