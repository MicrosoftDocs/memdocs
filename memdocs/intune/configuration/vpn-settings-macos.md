# Add VPN settings on macOS devices in Microsoft Intune

This article shows you the Intune settings you can use to configure VPN connections on devices running macOS.

Depending on the settings you choose, not all values in the following list are configurable.

## Before you begin

Create a [macOS VPN device configuration profile](vpn-settings-configure.md).

> [!NOTE]
> These settings are available for all enrollment types. For more information on the enrollment types, see [macOS enrollment](../enrollment/macos-enroll.md).

## Base VPN

**Connection name**: Enter a name for this connection. End users see this name when they browse their device for the list of available VPN connections.

- **VPN server address**: Enter the IP address or fully qualified domain name of the VPN server that devices connect to. For example, enter `192.168.1.1` or `vpn.contoso.com`.
- **Authentication method**: Choose how devices authenticate to the VPN server. Your options:
  - **Certificates**: Under **Authentication certificate**, select a SCEP or PKCS certificate profile you previously created to authenticate the connection. For more information about certificate profiles, see [How to configure certificates](../protect/certificates-configure.md).
  - **Username and password**: End users must supply a username and password to log into the VPN server.
- **Connection type**: Select the VPN connection type from the following list of vendors:
  - **Check Point Capsule VPN**
  - **Cisco AnyConnect**
  - **SonicWall Mobile Connect**
  - **F5 Edge Client**
  - **NetMotion Mobility**
  - **Custom VPN**: Select this option if your VPN vendor isn't listed. Also configure:

    - **VPN identifier**: Enter an identifier for the VPN app you're using. This identifier is supplied by your VPN provider.
    - **Enter key and value pairs for the custom VPN attributes**: Add or import **Keys** and **Values** that customize your VPN connection. These values are typically supplied by your VPN provider.

- **Split tunneling**: **Enable** or **Disable** this option that lets devices decide which connection to use depending on the traffic. For example, a user in a hotel uses the VPN connection to access work files, but use the hotel's standard network for regular web browsing.

## Automatic VPN

Select the type of automatic VPN you want: On-demand VPN or Per-app VPN:

- **On-demand VPN**: On-demand VPN uses rules to automatically connect or disconnect the VPN connection. When your devices attempt to connect to the VPN, it looks for matches in the parameters and rules you create, such as a matching IP address or domain name. If there's a match, then the action you choose runs.

  For example, create a condition where the VPN connection is only used when a device isn't connected to a company Wi-Fi network. Or, if a device can't access a DNS search domain you enter, then the VPN connection isn't started.

  - **Add**: Select this option to add a rule.

  - **I want to do the following**: If there's a match between the device value and your on-demand rule, then select the action. Your options:

    - Establish VPN
    - Disconnect VPN
    - Evaluate each connection attempt
    - Ignore

  - **I want to restrict to**: Select the condition that the rule must meet. Your options:

    - **Specific SSIDs**: Enter one or more wireless network names that the rule will apply. This network name is the Service Set Identifier (SSID). For example, enter `Contoso VPN`.
    - **Specific DNS domains**: Enter one or more DNS domains that the rule will apply. For example, enter `contoso.com`.
    - **All domains**: Select this option to apply your rule to all domains in your organization.

  - **But only if this URL probe succeeds**: Optional. Enter a URL that the rule uses as a test. If the device accesses this URL without redirection, then the VPN connection is started. And, the device connects to the target URL. The user doesn't see the URL string probe site.

    For example, a URL string probe is an auditing Web server URL that checks device compliance before connecting the VPN. Or, the URL tests the VPNs ability to connect to a site before the device connects to the target URL through the VPN.

- **Prevent users from disabling automatic VPN**: Your options:

  - **Not configured**: Intune doesn't change or update this setting.
  - **Yes**: Prevents users from turning off automatic VPN. It forces users to keep the automatic VPN enabled and running.
  - **No**: Allows users to turn off automatic VPN.

  This setting applies to:  
  - macOS 11 and newer (Big Sur)

- **Per-app VPN**: Enables per-app VPN by associating this VPN connection with a macOS app. When the app runs, the VPN connection starts. You can associate the VPN profile with an app when you assign the software. For more information, see [How to assign and monitor apps](../apps/apps-deploy.md).

  - **Safari URLs that will trigger this VPN**: Add one or more web site URLs. When these URLs are visited using the Safari browser on the device, the VPN connection is automatically established.

  - **Associated Domains**: Enter associated domains in the VPN profile that automatically start the VPN connection. For example, enter `contoso.com`. Devices in the `contoso.com` domain automatically start the VPN connection.

    For more information, see [associated domains](device-features-configure.md#associated-domains).

  - **Excluded Domains**: Enter domains that can bypass the VPN connection when per-app VPN is connected. For example, enter `contoso.com`. Devices in the `contoso.com` domain won't start or use the per-app VPN connection. Devices in the `contoso.com` domain will use the public Internet.

  - **Prevent users from disabling automatic VPN**: Your options:

    - **Not configured**: Intune doesn't change or update this setting.
    - **Yes**: Prevents users from turning off automatic VPN. It forces users to keep the automatic VPN enabled and running.
    - **No**: Allows users to turn off automatic VPN.

    This setting applies to:  
    - macOS 11 and newer (Big Sur)

## Proxy

- **Automatic configuration script**: Use a file to configure the proxy server. Enter the proxy server URL that includes the configuration file. For example, enter `http://proxy.contoso.com/pac`.
- **Address**: Enter the IP address or fully qualified host name of the proxy server. For example, enter `10.0.0.3` or `vpn.contoso.com`.
- **Port number**: Enter the port number associated with the proxy server. For example, enter `8080`.

## Next steps

The profile is created, but it may not be doing anything yet. Be sure to [assign the profile](device-profile-assign.md), and [monitor its status](device-profile-monitor.md).

Configure VPN settings on [Android](vpn-settings-android.md), [Android Enterprise](vpn-settings-android-enterprise.md), [iOS/iPadOS](vpn-settings-ios.md), and [Windows 10](vpn-settings-windows-10.md) devices.
