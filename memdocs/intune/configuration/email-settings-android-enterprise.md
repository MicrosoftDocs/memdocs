# Android Enterprise device settings to configure email, authentication, and synchronization in Intune

This article lists and describes the different email settings you can control on Android Enterprise devices. As part of your mobile device management (MDM) solution, use these settings to configure an email server, use SSL to encrypt emails, and more.

As an Intune administrator, you can create and assign email settings to Android Enterprise devices in the work profile.

To learn more about email profiles in Intune, see [configure email settings](email-settings-configure.md).

## Before you begin

Create a [device configuration profile](email-settings-configure.md) (choose the work profile), or create an [app configuration policy](../apps/app-configuration-policies-use-android.md).

## Android Enterprise

- **Email app**: Select **Gmail** or **Nine Work**.
- **Email server**: Enter the host name of your Exchange server. For example, enter `outlook.office365.com`.
- **Username attribute from AAD**: This name is the attribute Intune gets from Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). Intune dynamically generates the username that's used by this profile. Your options:

  - **User Principal Name**: Gets the name, such as `user1` or `user1@contoso.com`.
  - **User name**: Gets only the name, such as `user1`.

- **Email address attribute from AAD**: This name is the email attribute Intune gets from Azure AD. Intune dynamically generates the email address that's used by this profile. Your options:
  - **User principal name**:  Uses the full principal name, such as `user1@contoso.com` or `user1`, as the email address.
  - **Primary SMTP address**: Uses the primary SMTP address, such as `user1@contoso.com`, to sign in to Exchange.

- **Authentication method**: Select **Username and Password** or **Certificates** as the authentication method used by the email profile.
  - If you select **Certificate**, select a client SCEP or PKCS certificate profile that you previously created to authenticate the Exchange connection.
- **SSL**: Choose **Enable** to use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) communication when sending emails, receiving emails, and communicating with the Exchange server.
- **Amount of email to synchronize**: Choose the amount of time of email you want to synchronize. Or, select **Unlimited** to synchronize all available email.
- **Content type to sync** (Nine Work only): Choose which data you want to synchronize on the devices. Your options:
  - **Contacts**: Choose **Enable** to allow end users to sync contacts to their devices.
  - **Calendar**: Choose **Enable** to allow end users to sync the calendar to their devices.
  - **Tasks**: Choose **Enable** to allow end users to sync any tasks to their devices.

## Next steps

[Assign the profile](device-profile-assign.md) and [monitor its status](device-profile-monitor.md).

You can also create email profiles for [Android Samsung Knox](email-settings-android.md), [iOS/iPadOS](email-settings-ios.md), and [Windows 10 and later](email-settings-windows-10.md) devices.
