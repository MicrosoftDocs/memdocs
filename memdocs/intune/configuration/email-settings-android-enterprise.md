# Android Enterprise device settings to configure email, authentication, and synchronization in Intune

This article describes the different email settings you can control on Android Enterprise personally owned devices with a work profile. As part of your mobile device management (MDM) solution, use these settings to configure an email server, use SSL to encrypt emails, and more.

This feature applies to:

- Android Enterprise personally owned devices with a work profile (BYOD)

On Android Enterprise Fully Managed, Dedicated, and Corporate-owned Work Profiles, use [app configuration policies](../apps/app-configuration-policies-use-android.md). For Android device administrator, see [Android device settings to configure email](email-settings-android.md).

As an Intune administrator, you can create and assign email settings to Android Enterprise personally owned devices with a work profile. To learn more about email profiles in Intune, see [configure email settings](email-settings-configure.md).

## Before you begin

- Create an [Android Enterprise email device configuration profile](email-settings-configure.md) > **Personally-owned work profile**.
- Or, create an [app configuration policy](../apps/app-configuration-policies-use-android.md).

## Android Enterprise

- **Email app**: Select **Gmail** or **Nine Work**.
- **Email server**: Enter the host name of your Exchange server. For example, enter `outlook.office365.com`.
- **Username attribute from AAD**: This name is the attribute Intune gets from Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). Intune dynamically generates the username that's used by this profile. Your options:

  - **User Principal Name**: Gets the name, such as `user1` or `user1@contoso.com`.
  - **User name**: Gets only the name, such as `user1`.

- **Email address attribute from AAD**: This name is the email attribute Intune gets from Azure AD. Intune dynamically generates the email address that's used by this profile. Your options:
  - **User principal name**:  Uses the full principal name, such as `user1@contoso.com` or `user1`, as the email address.
  - **Primary SMTP address**: Uses the primary SMTP address, such as `user1@contoso.com`, to sign in to Exchange.

- **Authentication method**: Select **Username and Password** or **Certificates** as the authentication method used by the email profile.
  - If you select **Certificate**, select a client SCEP or PKCS certificate profile that you previously created to authenticate the Exchange connection.
- **SSL**: Choose **Enable** to use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) communication when sending emails, receiving emails, and communicating with the Exchange server.
- **Amount of email to synchronize**: Choose the amount of time of email you want to synchronize. Or, select **Unlimited** to synchronize all available email.
- **Content type to sync** (Nine Work only): Choose which data you want to synchronize on the devices. Your options:
  - **Contacts**: Choose **Enable** to allow end users to sync contacts to their devices.
  - **Calendar**: Choose **Enable** to allow end users to sync the calendar to their devices.
  - **Tasks**: Choose **Enable** to allow end users to sync any tasks to their devices.

## Next steps

[Assign the profile](device-profile-assign.md) and [monitor its status](device-profile-monitor.md).

You can also create email profiles for [Android Samsung Knox](email-settings-android.md), [iOS/iPadOS](email-settings-ios.md), and [Windows 10 and later](email-settings-windows-10.md) devices.
