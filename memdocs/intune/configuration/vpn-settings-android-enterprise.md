# Android Enterprise device settings to configure VPN in Intune

This article describes the different VPN connection settings you can control on Android Enterprise devices. As part of your mobile device management (MDM) solution, use these settings to create a VPN connection, choose how the VPN authenticates, select a VPN server type, and more.

This feature applies to:

- Android Enterprise personally owned devices with a work profile (BYOD)
- Android Enterprise corporate-owned work profile (COPE)
- Android Enterprise corporate owned fully managed (COBO)
- Android Enterprise corporate owned dedicated devices (COSU)

As an Intune administrator, you can create and assign VPN settings to Android Enterprise devices. To learn more about VPN profiles in Intune, see [VPN profiles](vpn-settings-configure.md).

> [!NOTE]
> To configure always-on VPN, you need to create a VPN profile, and also create a [device restrictions](device-restrictions-android-for-work.md#connectivity) profile with the Always-on VPN setting configured.

## Before you begin

Create an [Android Enterprise VPN device configuration profile](vpn-settings-configure.md):

- Fully managed, dedicated, and corporate-owned work profile
- Personally-owned work profile

## Fully Managed, Dedicated, and Corporate-Owned Work Profile

- **Connection type**: Select the VPN connection type. Your options:

  - **Cisco AnyConnect**
  - **SonicWall Mobile Connect**
  - **F5 Access**
  - **Pulse Secure**
  - **Microsoft Tunnel (standalone client)** (Not supported on Android Enterprise dedicated devices.)  

    > [!Important]
    > In preparation for the [public preview of Tunnel client functionality in the Microsoft Defender for Endpoint app](https://aka.ms/defendertunnel), the VPN profile connection type for the Microsoft Tunnel client app has been renamed to **Microsoft Tunnel (standalone client)**. At this time, you should use the **Microsoft Tunnel (standalone client)** connection type, not the **Microsoft Tunnel** connection type.  

The available settings depend on the VPN client you choose. Some settings are only available for specific VPN clients.

### Base VPN

- **Connection name**: Enter a name for this connection. End users see this name when they browse their device for the available VPN connections. For example, enter `Contoso VPN`.
- **VPN server address or FQDN**: Enter the IP address or fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the VPN server that devices connect. For example, enter `192.168.1.1` or `vpn.contoso.com`.
- **Authentication method**: Choose how devices authenticate to the VPN server. Your options:
  
  - **Certificates**: Select an existing SCEP or PKCS certificate profile to authenticate the connection. [Configure certificates](../protect/certificates-configure.md) lists the steps to create a certificate profile.
  - **Username and password**: When signing into the VPN server, end users are prompted to enter their user name and password.
  - **Derived credential**: Use a certificate that's derived from a user's smart card. If no derived credential issuer is configured, Intune prompts you to add one.

    For more information, see [Use derived credentials in Intune](../protect/derived-credentials.md).

- **Enter key and value pairs for the NetMotion Mobility VPN attributes**: Add or import **Keys** and **Values** that customize your VPN connection. These values are typically supplied by your VPN provider.

- **Microsoft Tunnel site** (Microsoft Tunnel only): Select an existing site. The VPN client connects to the public IP address or FQDN of this site.

  For more information, see [Microsoft Tunnel for Intune](../protect/microsoft-tunnel-overview.md).

### Per-app VPN

- **Add**: Select managed apps from the list. When users start the apps you add, traffic automatically routes through the VPN connection.

For more information, see [Use a VPN and per-app VPN policy on Android Enterprise devices](../apps/app-configuration-vpn-ae.md).

### Always-on VPN

- **Always-on VPN**: **Enable** turns on always-on VPN so VPN clients automatically connect and reconnect to the VPN when possible. When set to **Not configured**, Intune doesn't change or update this setting. By default, always-on VPN might be disabled for all VPN clients.

  Only one VPN client can be configured for always-on VPN on a device. Be sure to have no more than one always-on VPN policy deployed to a single device.

### Proxy

- **Automatic configuration script**: Use a file to configure the proxy server. Enter the proxy server URL that includes the configuration file. For example, enter `http://proxy.contoso.com/pac`.
- **Address**: Enter the IP address or fully qualified host name of the proxy server. For example, enter `10.0.0.3` or `vpn.contoso.com`.
- **Port number**: Enter the port number associated with the proxy server. For example, enter `8080`.

## Personally-owned work profile

- **Connection type**: Select the VPN connection type. Your options:

  - **Check Point Capsule VPN**
  - **Cisco AnyConnect**
  - **SonicWall Mobile Connect**
  - **F5 Access**
  - **Pulse Secure**
  - **NetMotion Mobility**
  - **Microsoft Tunnel (standalone client)**  

    > [!Important]
    > In preparation for the [public preview of Tunnel client functionality in the Microsoft Defender for Endpoint app](https://aka.ms/defendertunnel), the VPN profile connection type for the Microsoft Tunnel client app has been renamed to **Microsoft Tunnel (standalone client)**.

- **VPN server address**: Enter the IP address or fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the VPN server that devices connect. For example, enter `192.168.1.1` or `vpn.contoso.com`.
- **Authentication method**: Choose how devices authenticate to the VPN server. Your options:
  
  - **Certificates**: Select an existing SCEP or PKCS certificate profile to authenticate the connection. [Configure certificates](../protect/certificates-configure.md) lists the steps to create a certificate profile.
  - **Username and password**: When signing into the VPN server, end users are prompted to enter their user name and password.
  - **Derived credential**: Use a certificate that's derived from a user's smart card. If no derived credential issuer is configured, Intune prompts you to add one.

    For more information, see [Use derived credentials in Intune](../protect/derived-credentials.md).

- **Fingerprint** (Check Point Capsule VPN only): Enter the fingerprint string given to you by the VPN vendor, such as `Contoso Fingerprint Code`. This fingerprint verifies that the VPN server can be trusted. 

  When authenticating, a fingerprint is sent to the client so the client knows to trust any server that has the same fingerprint. If the device doesn't have the fingerprint, it prompts the user to trust the VPN server while showing the fingerprint. The user manually verifies the fingerprint, and chooses to trust to connect.

- **Enter key and value pairs for the NetMotion Mobility VPN attributes**: Add or import **Keys** and **Values** that customize your VPN connection. These values are typically supplied by your VPN provider.

- **Microsoft Tunnel site** (Microsoft Tunnel only): Select an existing site. The VPN client connects to the public IP address or FQDN of this site.

  For more information, see [Microsoft Tunnel for Intune](../protect/microsoft-tunnel-overview.md).

### Per-app VPN

- **Add**: Select managed apps from the list. When users start the apps you add, traffic automatically routes through the VPN connection.

- **Address**: Enter the IP address or fully qualified host name of the proxy server. For example, enter `10.0.0.3` or `vpn.contoso.com`.
- **Port number**: Enter the port number associated with the proxy server. For example, enter `8080`.

## Next steps

[Assign the profile](device-profile-assign.md) and [monitor its status](device-profile-monitor.md).

You can also create VPN profiles for [Android device administrator](vpn-settings-android.md), [iOS/iPadOS](vpn-settings-ios.md), [macOS](vpn-settings-macos.md), [Windows 10 and later](vpn-settings-windows-10.md), and [Windows 8.1](vpn-settings-windows-8-1.md).
