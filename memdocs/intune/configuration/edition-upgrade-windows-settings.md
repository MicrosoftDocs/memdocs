# Windows 10 (and newer) device settings to upgrade editions or enable S mode in Intune

Microsoft Intune includes many settings to help manage and protect your devices. This article lists and describes the settings to upgrade editions or enable S mode on Windows 10 devices. These settings are created in an upgrade configuration profile in Intune that are pushed or deployed to devices.

As part of your mobile device management (MDM) solution, use these settings to control the edition and S mode options for your Windows 10 devices.

For more information on this feature, see [Upgrade Windows 10 editions or enable S mode](edition-upgrade-configure-windows-10.md).

## Before you begin

[Create the profile](edition-upgrade-configure-windows-10.md#create-the-profile).

## Edition upgrade

- **Edition to upgrade to**: Select the Windows 10 edition that you're upgrading to. The devices targeted by this policy are upgraded to the edition you choose.
- **Product Key**: Enter the product key that you received from Microsoft. After you create the policy with the product key, the key can't be updated, and is hidden for security reasons. To change the product key, enter the entire key again.
- **License File**: For **Windows 10 Holographic for Business** or **Windows 10 Mobile edition**, choose **Browse** to select the license file you received from Microsoft. This license file includes license information for the editions you're upgrading the devices to.

## Mode switch

- **No configuration**: An S mode device stays in S mode. An end user can switch the device out of S mode.
- **Keep in S mode**: Disables the end user from switching the device out of S mode.
- **Switch**: Switches the device out of S mode.

## Next steps

The profile is created, but it may not be doing anything yet. Be sure to [assign the profile](device-profile-assign.md), and [monitor its status](device-profile-monitor.md).

You can also create edition upgrade profiles for [Windows Holographic for Business](holographic-upgrade.md) devices.
