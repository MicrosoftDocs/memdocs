# iOS and iPadOS device settings to allow or restrict features using Intune

This article lists and describes the different settings you can control on iOS and iPadOS devices. As part of your mobile device management (MDM) solution, use these settings to allow or disable features, set password rules, allow or restrict specific apps, and more.

These settings are added to a device configuration profile in Intune, and then assigned or deployed to your iOS/iPadOS devices.

> [!TIP]
> These settings use Apple's MDM settings. For more information on these settings, see [Apple's mobile device management settings](https://support.apple.com/guide/mdm/welcome/web) (opens Apple's web site).

## Before you begin

[Create a device restrictions configuration profile](device-restrictions-configure.md).

> [!NOTE]
> These settings apply to different enrollment types, with some settings applying to all enrollment options. For more information on the different enrollment types, see [iOS/iPadOS enrollment](../enrollment/ios-enroll.md).

## General

### Settings apply to: All enrollment types

- **Share usage data**: **Block** prevents devices from sending diagnostic and usage data to Apple. When set to **Not configured** (default), Intune doesn't change or update this setting. By default, the OS might allow this data to be sent.

- **Screen capture**: **Block** prevents screenshots or screen captures on devices. In iOS/iPadOS 9.0 and newer, it also blocks screen recordings. When set to **Not configured** (default), Intune doesn't change or update this setting. By default, the OS might let users capture the screen contents as an image or as a video.

### Settings apply to: Device enrollment, Automated device enrollment (supervised)

- **Untrusted TLS certificates**: **Block** prevents untrusted Transport Layer Security (TLS) certificates on devices. When set to **Not configured** (default), Intune doesn't change or update this setting. By default, the OS might allow TLS certificates.
- **Block over-the-air PKI updates**: **Block** prevents your users from receiving software updates unless devices are connected to a computer. When set to **Not configured** (default), Intune doesn't change or update this setting. By default, the OS might allow a device to receive software updates without being connected to a computer.
- **Limit ad tracking**: **Limit** disables the device advertising identifier. When set to **Not configured** (default), Intune doesn't change or update this setting. By default, the OS might keep it enabled.
- **Enterprise app trust**: **Block** removes the **Trust Enterprise Developer** button in Settings > General > Profiles & Device Management on devices. When set to **Not configured** (default), Intune doesn't change or update this setting. By default, the OS might let users choose to trust apps that aren't downloaded from the app store.

### Settings apply to: Automated device enrollment (supervised)

- **Diagnostics submission settings modification**: **Block** prevents users from changing the diagnostic submission and app analytics settings in **Diagnostics and Usage** (device Settings). When set to **Not configured** (default), Intune doesn't change or update this setting. By default, the OS might allow users to change these device settings.

  To use this setting, set the **Share usage data** setting to **Block**.

  This feature applies to:  
  - iOS 9.3.2 and newer
  - iPadOS 13.0 and newer

- **Remote screen observation by Classroom app**: **Block** prevents the Classroom app from remotely viewing the screen on devices. When set to **Not configured** (default), Intune doesn't change or update this setting. By default, the OS might allow the Apple Classroom app to view the screen.

  To use this setting, set the **Screen capture** setting to **Block**.

  This feature applies to:  
  - iOS 9.3 and newer
  - iPadOS 13.0 and newer

- **Unprompted screen observation by Classroom app**: **Allow** lets teachers silently observe the screen of students' iOS/iPadOS devices using the Classroom app without the students knowledge. Student devices enrolled in a class using the Classroom app automatically give permission to that course's teacher. When set to **Not configured** (default), Intune doesn't change or update this setting. By default, the OS might prevent this feature.

  To use this setting, set the **Screen capture** setting to **Block**.

- **Account modification**: **Block** prevents users from updating device-specific settings from the iOS/iPadOS settings app. For example, users can't create new device accounts, or change the user name or password. When set to **Not configured** (default), Intune doesn't change or update this setting. By default, the OS might allow users to change these settings.

  This feature also applies to settings accessible from the iOS/iPadOS settings app, such as Mail, Contacts, Calendar, Twitter, and more. This feature doesn't apply to apps with account settings that aren't configurable from the iOS/iPadOS settings app, such as the Microsoft Outlook app.

- **Screen time**: **Block** prevents users from setting their own restrictions in Screen Time (device settings). When set to **Not configured** (default), Intune doesn't change or update this setting. By default, the OS might allow users to configure device restrictions (such as parental controls or content, and privacy restrictions) on devices.

  This setting was renamed from **Enabling restrictions in the device settings**. Impact of this change:  
  
  - iOS 11.4.1 and older: **Block** prevents users from setting their own restrictions in the device settings. The behavior is the same; and there are no changes for users.
  - iOS 12.0 and newer: **Block** prevents users from setting their own **Screen Time** in the device settings (Settings > General > Screen Time), including content and privacy restrictions. Devices upgraded to iOS 12.0 won't see the restrictions tab in the device settings anymore (Settings > General > Device Management > Management Profile > Restrictions). These settings are in **Screen Time**.
  
- **Use of the erase all content and settings option on the device**: **Block** prevents using the erase all content and settings option on devices. When set to **Not configured** (default), Intune doesn't change or update this setting. By default, the OS might give users access to these settings.

- **Activation Lock**: **Allow** enables Activation Lock on supervised iOS/iPadOS devices. Activation Lock makes it harder for a lost or stolen device to be reactivated. When set to **Not configured** (default), Intune doesn't change or update this setting.
- **Block app removal**: **Block** prevents removing apps. When set to **Not configured** (default), Intune doesn't change or update this setting. By default, the OS might allow users to remove apps from devices.
- **Allow USB accessories while device is locked**: **Allow** lets USB accessories exchange data with devices that are locked for over an hour. When set to **Not configured** (default), Intune doesn't change or update this setting. By default, the OS might not update USB Restricted mode on devices, and USB accessories are blocked from transferring data from devices if locked for over an hour.
- **Force automatic date and time**: **Require** forces supervised devices to set the Date & Time automatically. The device's time zone is updated when the device has cellular connections or has Wi-Fi with location services enabled. When set to **Not configured** (default), Intune doesn't change or update this setting.
- **Require students to request permission to leave Classroom course**: **Require** forces students enrolled in an unmanaged course using the Classroom app to request permission from the teacher to leave the course. When set to **Not configured** (default), Intune doesn't change or update this setting. By default, the OS might not force the student to ask for permission.

  This feature applies to:  
  - iOS 11.3 and newer
  - iPadOS 13.0 and newer

- **Allow Classroom to lock to an app and lock the device without prompting**: **Enable** allows teacher to lock apps or lock devices using the Classroom app without prompting the student. Locking apps means devices can only access teacher specified apps. When set to **Not configured** (default), Intune doesn't change or update this setting. By default, the OS might prevent teachers from locking apps or devices using the Classroom app without prompting the student.

  This feature applies to:  
  - iOS 11.0 and newer
  - iPadOS 13.0 and newer

- **Automatically join Classroom classes without prompting**: **Enable** automatically allows students to join a class that's in the Classroom app without prompting the teacher. When set to **Not configured** (default), Intune doesn't change or update this setting. By default, the OS might prompt the teacher that students want to join a class that's in the Classroom app.

  This feature applies to:  
  - iOS 11.0 and newer
  - iPadOS 13.0 and newer

- **Block VPN creation**: **Block** prevents users from creating VPN configuration settings. When set to **Not configured** (default), Intune doesn't change or update this setting. By default, the OS might let users create VPNs on devices.
- **Modifying eSIM settings**: **Block** prevents removing or adding a cellular plan to the eSIM on devices. When set to **Not configured** (default), Intune doesn't change or update this setting. By default, the OS might allow users to change these settings.

  This feature applies to:  
  - iOS 12.1 and newer
  - iPadOS 13.0 and newer

- **Defer software updates**: **Enable** allows you to delay when software updates are shown on devices, from 0-90 days. This setting doesn't control when updates are or aren't installed.

  When set to **Not configured** (default), Intune doesn't change or update this setting. By default, the OS might show software updates on devices as Apple releases them. For example, if an iOS/iPadOS update gets released by Apple on a specific date, then that update naturally shows up on devices around the release date.  

  - **Delay visibility of software updates**: Enter a value from 0-90 days. When the delay expires, users get notified to update to the earliest OS version available when the delay is triggered.

    For example, if iOS 12.a is available on **January 1**, and **Delay visibility** is set to **5 days**, then iOS 12.a isn't shown as an available update on user devices. On the **sixth day** following the release, that update is available, and users can install it.

    This setting applies to:  
    - iOS 11.3 and newer
    - iPadOS 13.0 and newer

## Password

### Settings apply to: All enrollment types

- **Password**: **Require** users to enter a password to access devices. When set to **Not configured** (default), Intune doesn't change or update this setting. By default, the OS might allow users to access devices without entering a password.

### Settings apply to: Device enrollment, Automated device enrollment (supervised)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> On user-enrolled devices, if you configure any password setting, then the **Simple passwords** settings is automatically set to **Block**, and a 6 digit PIN is enforced.
>
> For example, you configure the **Password expiration** setting, and push this policy to user-enrolled devices. On the devices, the following happens:
>
> - The **Password expiration** setting is ignored.
> - Simple passwords, such as `1111` or `1234`, aren't allowed.
> - A 6 digit pin is enforced.

- **Simple passwords**: **Block** requires more complex passwords. When set to **Not configured** (default), Intune doesn't change or update this setting. By default, the OS might allow simple passwords, such as `0000` and `1234`.

- **Required password type**: Enter the required password complexity level your organization requires. Your options:
  - **Device default**
  - **Numeric**: Password must only be numbers, such as 123456789.
  - **Alphanumeric**: Includes uppercase letters, lowercase letters, and numeric characters.
- **Number of non-alphanumeric characters in password**: Enter the number of symbol characters, such as `#` or `@`, that must be included in the password, from 1-4. When set to **Not configured** (default), Intune doesn't change or update this setting.

- **Minimum password length**: Enter the minimum length the password must have, from 4-16 characters. On user enrolled devices, enter a length between 4 and 6 characters.
  
  > [!NOTE]
  > For devices that are user enrolled, users can set a PIN greater than 6 digits. But, no more than 6 digits are enforced on devices. For example, an administrator sets the minimum length to `8`. On user-enrolled devices, users are only required to set a 6 digit PIN. Intune doesn't force a PIN greater than 6 digits on user-enrolled devices.

- **Number of sign-in failures before wiping device**: Enter the number of failed sign-ins before the device is wiped, from 4-11.
  
  iOS/iPadOS has built-in security that can impact this setting. For example, iOS/iPadOS may delay triggering the policy depending on the number of sign in failures. It may also consider repeatedly entering the same passcode as one attempt. Apple's [iOS/iPadOS security guide](https://www.apple.com/business/site/docs/iOS_Security_Guide.pdf) (opens Apple's web site) is a good resource, and provides more specific details on passcodes.
  
- **Maximum minutes after screen lock before password is required**<sup>1</sup>: Enter how long devices stay idle before users must reenter their password. If the time you enter is longer than what's currently set on the device, then the device ignores the time you enter.

  This setting applies to:  
  - iOS 8.0+
  - iPadOS 13.0+

- **Maximum minutes of inactivity until screen locks**<sup>1</sup>: Enter the maximum number of minutes of inactivity allowed on devices until the screen locks.

  **iOS/iPadOS options**:  

  - **Not configured** (Default): Intune doesn't change or update this setting.
  - **Immediately**: Screen locks after 30 seconds of inactivity.
  - **1**: Screen locks after 1 minute of inactivity.
  - **2**: Screen locks after 2 minutes of inactivity.
  - **3**: Screen locks after 3 minutes of inactivity.
  - **4**: Screen locks after 4 minutes of inactivity.
  - **5**: Screen locks after 5 minutes of inactivity.

  **iPadOS options**:  

  - **Not configured** (Default): Intune doesn't change or update this setting.
  - **Immediately**: Screen locks after 2 minutes of inactivity.
  - **2**: Screen locks after 2 minutes of inactivity.
  - **5**: Screen locks after 5 minutes of inactivity.
  - **10**: Screen locks after 10 minutes of inactivity.
  - **15**: Screen locks after 15 minutes of inactivity.

  If a value doesn't apply to iOS and iPadOS, then Apple uses the closest *lowest* value. For example, if you enter `4` minutes, then iPadOS devices use `2` minutes. If you enter `10` minutes, then iOS devices use `5` minutes. This is an Apple limitation.
  
  > [!NOTE]
  > The Intune UI for this setting doesn't separate the iOS and iPadOS supported values. The UI might be updated in a future release.

- **Password expiration (days)**: Enter the number of days before the device password must be changed, from 1-65535.
- **Prevent reuse of previous passwords**: Use this setting to restrict users from creating previously used passwords. Enter the number of previously used passwords that can't be used, from 1-24. For example, enter 5 so users can't set a new password to their current password or any of their previous four passwords. When the value is blank, Intune doesn't change or update this setting.
- **Touch ID and Face ID unlock**: **Block** prevents using a fingerprint or face to unlock devices. When set to **Not configured** (default), Intune doesn't change or update this setting. By default, the OS might allow users to unlock devices using biometrics.

  Blocking this setting also prevents using FaceID authentication to unlock devices.

  Face ID applies to:  
  - iOS 11.0 and newer
  - iPadOS 13.0 and newer

### Settings apply to: Automated device enrollment (supervised)

- **Passcode modification**: **Block** stops the passcode from being changed, added, or removed. After blocking this feature, changes to passcode restrictions are ignored on supervised devices. When set to **Not configured** (default), Intune doesn't change or update this setting. By default, the OS might allow passcodes to be added, changed, or removed.

  - **Touch ID and Face ID modification**: **Block** stops users from changing, adding, or removing TouchID fingerprints and Face ID. When set to **Not configured** (default), Intune doesn't change or update this setting. By default, the OS might allow users to update the TouchID fingerprints and Face ID on devices.

    Blocking this setting also stops users from changing, adding, or removing FaceID authentication.

    Face ID applies to:  
    - iOS 11.0 and newer
    - iPadOS 13.0 and newer

- **Block password AutoFill**: **Block** prevents using the AutoFill Passwords feature on iOS/iPadOS. Choosing **Block** also has the following impact:

  - Users aren't prompted to use a saved password in Safari or in any apps.
  - Automatic Strong Passwords are disabled, and strong passwords aren't suggested to users.

  When set to **Not configured** (default), Intune doesn't change or update this setting. By default, the OS might allow these features.

- **Block password proximity requests**: **Block** prevents devices from requesting passwords from nearby devices. When set to **Not configured** (default), Intune doesn't change or update this setting. By default, the OS might allow these password requests.
- **Block password sharing**: **Block** prevents sharing passwords between devices using AirDrop. When set to **Not configured** (default), Intune doesn't change or update this setting. By default, the OS might allow passwords to be shared.
- **Require Touch ID or Face ID authentication for password or credit card information AutoFill**: **Require** forces users to authenticate using TouchID or FaceID before passwords or credit card information can be auto filled in Safari and other apps. When set to **Not configured** (default), Intune doesn't change or update this setting. By default, the OS might allow users to control this feature in the device settings.

  This feature applies to:  
  - iOS 11.0 and newer
  - iPadOS 13.0 and newer
  
<sup>1</sup> When you configure the **Maximum minutes of inactivity until screen locks** and **Maximum minutes after screen lock before password is required** settings, they're applied in sequence. For example, if you set the value for both settings to **5** minutes, the screen turns off automatically after five minutes, and devices are locked after an additional five minutes. However, if users turn off the screen manually, the second setting is immediately applied. In the same example, after users turn off the screen, the device locks five minutes later.
