# iOS and iPadOS device settings to allow or restrict features using Intune

> [!NOTE]
> [!INCLUDE [not-all-settings-are-documented](../includes/not-all-settings-are-documented.md)]

This article describes the different settings you can control on iOS and iPadOS devices. As part of your mobile device management (MDM) solution, use these settings to allow or disable features, set password rules, allow or restrict specific apps, and more.

This feature applies to:

- iOS/iPadOS

These settings are added to a device configuration profile in Intune, and then assigned or deployed to your iOS/iPadOS devices.

> [!TIP]
> These settings use Apple's restriction settings. For more information on these settings, see [Apple's mobile device management settings site](https://support.apple.com/guide/deployment/restrictions-for-iphone-and-ipad-dep0f7dd3d8/web) (opens Apple's web site).

## Before you begin

When configuring device restriction policies, the broad range of settings enable you to tailor protection to your specific needs. <!-- removing while iOS security framework docs are pending freshness update. To better understand how to implement specific security configuration scenarios, see the security configuration framework guidance for iOS device restriction policies. The security configuration framework is organized into distinct configuration levels that provide guidance for personally owned and supervised devices, with each level building off the previous level. The available levels and settings in each level vary by device type:-->

<!--- For personal devices, see [iOS/iPadOS personal device security configurations](../enrollment/ios-ipados-personal-device-security-configurations.md)
- For supervised devices, see [iOS/iPadOS supervised device security configurations](../enrollment/ios-ipados-supervised-device-security-configurations.md)-->     

When you're ready to proceed, create an [iOS/iPadOS device restrictions configuration profile](device-restrictions-configure.md).

> [!NOTE]
> These settings apply to different enrollment types, with some settings applying to all enrollment options. For more information on the different enrollment types, see [iOS/iPadOS enrollment](../fundamentals/deployment-guide-enrollment-ios-ipados.md).

## App Store, Doc Viewing, Gaming

### Settings apply to: All enrollment types

- **Block viewing corporate documents in unmanaged apps**: **Yes** prevents viewing corporate documents in unmanaged apps. When set to **Not configured** (default), Intune doesn't change or update this setting. By default, the OS might allow corporate documents to be viewed in any app.

  For example, you want to prevent users from saving files from the OneDrive app to Dropbox. Configure this setting as **Yes**. After devices receive the policy (for example, after a restart), it no longer allows saving.

  > [!NOTE]
  > When this setting is blocked (set to **Yes**), third party keyboards installed from the App Store are also blocked.

  - **Allow unmanaged apps to read from managed contacts accounts**: **Yes** lets unmanaged apps, such as the built-in iOS/iPadOS Contacts app, to read and access contact information from managed apps, including the Outlook mobile app. When set to **Not configured** (default), Intune doesn't change or update this setting. By default, the OS might prevent reading from the built-in Contacts app on devices.  
  
    This setting allows or prevents reading contact information. It doesn't control syncing contacts between the apps.
  
    To use this setting, set the **Block viewing corporate documents in unmanaged apps** setting to **Yes**.

  For more information about these two settings, and their impact on Outlook for iOS/iPadOS contact export synchronization, see [Support Tip: Use Intune custom profile settings with the iOS/iPadOS Native Contacts App](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Intune-Customer-Success/Support-Tip-Use-Intune-custom-profile-settings-with-the-iOS/ba-p/298453).

- **Treat AirDrop as an unmanaged destination**: **Yes** forces AirDrop to be considered an unmanaged drop target. It stops managed apps from sending data using Airdrop. When set to **Not configured** (default), Intune doesn't change or update this setting.
- **Block viewing non-corporate documents in corporate apps**: **Yes** prevents viewing non-corporate documents in corporate apps. When set to **Not configured** (default), Intune doesn't change or update this setting. By default, the OS might allow any document to be viewed in corporate managed apps.

  **Yes** also prevents contact export synchronization in Outlook for iOS/iPadOS. For more information, see [Support Tip: Enabling Outlook iOS/iPadOS Contact Sync with iOS12 MDM Controls](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Intune-Customer-Success/Support-Tip-Enabling-Outlook-iOS-Contact-Sync-with-iOS12-MDM/ba-p/298453).

## Autonomous single app mode (ASAM)

Use these settings to configure iOS/iPadOS devices to run specific apps in autonomous single app mode (ASAM). When ASAM is configured, and users start one of the configured apps, then the device is locked to that app. App/task switching is disabled until users exit the allowed app.

For the ASAM configuration to apply, users must manually open the specific app. This task also applies to the Company Portal app.

- For example, in a school or university environment, add an app that lets users take a test on the device. Or, lock the device into the Company Portal app until the user authenticates. When the apps actions are completed by users, or you remove this policy, the device returns to its normal state.

- Not all apps support autonomous single app mode. To put an app in ASAM, a bundle ID or a key value pair delivered by an app config policy are typically required. For more information, see the [`autonomousSingleAppModePermittedAppIDs` restriction](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/devicemanagement/restrictions) in Apple's MDM documentation. For more information on the specific settings required for the app you're configuring, see the vendor documentation.

  For example, to configure Zoom Rooms in autonomous single app mode, Zoom says to use the `us.zoom.zpcontroller` bundle ID. In this instance, you also make a change in the Zoom web portal. For more information, see the [Zoom help center](https://support.zoom.us/hc/articles/360021322632-Autonomous-Single-App-Mode-for-Zoom-Rooms-with-a-Third-Party-MDM).

- On iOS/iPadOS devices, the Company Portal app supports ASAM. When the Company Portal app is in ASAM, users must manually open the Company Portal app. Then the device is locked in the Company Portal app until the user authenticates. When users sign in to the Company Portal app, they can use other apps and the Home screen button on the device. When they sign out of the Company Portal app, the device returns to single app mode, and locks on the Company Portal app.

  To turn the Company Portal app into a 'sign in/sign out' app (enable ASAM), enter the Company Portal app name, such as `Microsoft Intune Company Portal`, and the bundle ID (`com.microsoft.CompanyPortal`) in these settings. After this profile is assigned, you must open the Company Portal app to lock the app so users can sign in and sign out of it. For the ASAM configuration to apply, users must manually open the Company Portal app.
  
  When the device configuration profile is removed, and the user signs out, the device isn't locked in the Company Portal app.

### Settings apply to: Automated device enrollment (supervised)

- **App name**: Enter the name of the app you want.
- **App Bundle ID**: Enter the [bundle ID](bundle-ids-built-in-ios-apps.md) of the app you want. To get the bundle ID of an app added to Intune, [you can use the Intune admin center](../apps/get-app-bundle-id-intune-admin-center.md).

>
> For example, you configure the **Password expiration** setting, and push this policy to user-enrolled devices. On the devices, the following happens:
>
> - The **Password expiration** setting is ignored.
> - Simple passwords, such as `1111` or `1234`, aren't allowed.
> - A 6 digit pin is enforced.

- **Block simple passwords**: **Yes** blocks simple passwords, and requires more complex passwords. When set to **Not configured** (default), Intune doesn't change or update this setting. By default, the OS might allow simple passwords, such as `0000` and `1234`.

- **Required password type**: Enter the required password complexity level your organization requires. Your options:
  - **Device default**
  - **Numeric**: Can be alphabetic characters, such as abcdef, and numeric characters, such as 123456789.
  - **Alphanumeric**: Includes uppercase letters, lowercase letters, and numeric characters.

  > [!NOTE]
  > Selecting alphanumeric can impact a paired Apple Watch. For more information, see [Set passcode restrictions for an Apple Watch](https://support.apple.com/HT204953) (opens Apple's web site).

- **Minimum password length**: Enter the minimum length the password must have, from 4-16 characters. On user enrolled devices, enter a length between 4 and 6 characters.
  
  > [!NOTE]
  > For devices that are user enrolled, users can set a PIN greater than 6 digits. But, no more than 6 digits are enforced on devices. For example, an administrator sets the minimum length to `8`. On user-enrolled devices, users are only required to set a 6 digit PIN. Intune doesn't force a PIN greater than 6 digits on user-enrolled devices.

- **Number of sign-in failures before wiping device**: Enter the number of failed sign-ins before the device is wiped, from 2-11. It's not recommended to set this value to `2` or `3`. It's common to enter the wrong password. Wiping the device after two or three incorrect password attempts happens often. It's recommended to set this value to at least `4`.
  
  iOS/iPadOS has built-in security that can impact this setting. For example, iOS/iPadOS may delay triggering the policy depending on the number of sign-in failures. It may also consider repeatedly entering the same passcode as one attempt. Apple's [iOS/iPadOS security guide](https://support.apple.com/guide/security/passcodes-and-passwords-sec20230a10d/web) (opens Apple's web site) is a good resource, and provides more specific details on passcodes.

- **Maximum minutes after screen lock before password is required**<sup>1</sup>: Enter how long devices stay idle before users must reenter their password. If the time you enter is longer than what's currently set on the device, then the device ignores the time you enter.

  This feature applies to:  
  - iOS 8.0+
  - iPadOS 13.0+

- **Maximum minutes of inactivity until screen locks**<sup>1</sup>: Enter the maximum number of minutes of inactivity allowed on devices until the screen locks.

  **iOS/iPadOS options**:

  - **5**: Screen locks after 5 minutes of inactivity.
  - **10**: Screen locks after 10 minutes of inactivity.
  - **15**: Screen locks after 15 minutes of inactivity.

  If a value doesn't apply to iOS and iPadOS, then Apple uses the closest *lowest* value. For example, if you enter `4` minutes, then iPadOS devices use `2` minutes. If you enter `10` minutes, then iOS devices use `5` minutes. This behavior is an Apple limitation.
  
  > [!NOTE]
  > The Intune UI for this setting doesn't separate the iOS and iPadOS supported values. The UI might be updated in a future release.

- **Password expiration (days)**: Enter the number of days before the device password must be changed, from 1-730.
- **Prevent reuse of previous passwords**: Restrict users from creating previous passwords. Enter the number of previously used passwords that can't be used, from 1-24.

- **Require Touch ID or Face ID authentication for AutoFill of password or credit card information**: **Yes** forces users to authenticate using TouchID or FaceID before passwords or credit card information can be auto filled in Safari and other apps. When set to **Not configured** (default), Intune doesn't change or update this setting. By default, the OS might allow users to control this feature in the device settings.

  This feature applies to:  
  - iOS 11.0 and newer
  - iPadOS 13.0 and newer
  
<sup>1</sup> When you configure the **Maximum minutes of inactivity until screen locks** and **Maximum minutes after screen lock before password is required** settings, they're applied in sequence. For example, if you set the value for both settings to **5** minutes, then the screen turns off automatically after five minutes, and devices are locked after another five minutes. However, if users turn off the screen manually, then the second setting is immediately applied. In the same example, after users turn off the screen, the device locks five minutes later.

## Restricted apps

### Settings apply to: Device enrollment and Automated device enrollment (supervised)

- **Type of restricted apps list**: Create a list of apps that users aren't allowed to install or use. Your options:

  - **Prohibited apps**: List the apps (not managed by Intune) that users aren't allowed to install and run. Users aren't prevented from installing a prohibited app. If a user installs an app from this list, then the device is reported in the **Devices with restricted apps** report ([Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431) > **Devices** > **Monitor** > **Devices with restricted apps**). 
  - **Approved apps**: List the apps that users are allowed to install. To stay compliant, users must not install other apps. Apps that are managed by Intune are automatically allowed, including the Company Portal app. Users aren't prevented from installing an app that isn't on the approved list. But if they do, it's reported in Intune.

  > [!NOTE]
  > When there's a restricted app on the device, this setting reports as 'Not compliant'.

To add apps to these lists, you can:

- Enter the iTunes App store URL of the app you want. For example, to add the Microsoft Work Folders app, enter `https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/work-folders/id950878067?mt=8` or `https://apps.apple.com/us/app/work-folders/id950878067?mt=8`.

  To find the URL of an app, open the iTunes App Store, and search for the app. For example, search for `Microsoft Remote Desktop` or `Microsoft Word`. Select the app, and copy the URL.

  You can also use iTunes to find the app, and then use the **Copy Link** task to get the app URL.

- **Import** a CSV file with details about the app, including the URL. Use the `<app url>, <app name>, <app publisher>` format. Or, **Export** an existing list that includes the restricted apps list in the same format.

> [!IMPORTANT]

- **Type of apps list**: Create a list of apps to show or hide. You can show or hide built-in apps and line-of-business apps. Apple's web site has a list of [built-in Apple apps](https://support.apple.com/HT211833). Your options:

  - **Not configured** (default): Intune doesn't change or update this setting.
  - **Hidden apps**: Enter a list of apps that are hidden from users. Users can't view, or open these apps.
  
    Apple prevents hiding some native apps. For example, you can't hide the **Settings** app on the device. [Delete built-in Apple apps](https://support.apple.com/HT211833) lists the apps that can be hidden.
  
  - **Visible apps**: Enter a list of apps that users can view and launch. No other apps can be viewed or launched.

- **App URL**: Enter the store app URL of the app you want to show or hide. For example:

  - To add the Microsoft Work Folders app, enter `https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/work-folders/id950878067?mt=8` or `https://apps.apple.com/us/app/work-folders/id950878067?mt=8`.

  - To add the Microsoft Word app, enter `https://itunes.apple.com/de/app/microsoft-word/id586447913` or `https://apps.apple.com/de/app/microsoft-word/id586447913`.

  To find the URL of an app, open the iTunes App Store, and search for the app. For example, search for `Microsoft Remote Desktop` or `Microsoft Word`. Select the app, and copy the URL.

  You can also use iTunes to find the app, and then use the **Copy Link** task to get the app URL.

- **App Bundle ID**: Enter the app [bundle ID](bundle-ids-built-in-ios-apps.md) of the app you want. You can show or hide built-in apps and line-of-business apps.

  To get the app bundle ID:

  - Apple's web site has a list of [built-in Apple apps](https://support.apple.com/HT211833).
  - For apps added to Intune, [you can use the Intune admin center](../apps/get-app-bundle-id-intune-admin-center.md).

- **App name**: Enter the app name of the app you want. You can show or hide built-in apps and line-of-business apps. Apple's web site has a list of [built-in Apple apps](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211833).
- **Publisher**: Enter the publisher of the app you want.

You can also:

- **Import** a CSV file with details about the app, including the URL. Use the `<app url>, <app name>, <app publisher>` format. Or, **Export** to create a list of the restricted apps you added, in the same format.

  > [!TIP]
  > You can import a list of preinstalled Apple apps by downloading the [Apple App BundleIDs CSV](https://github.com/microsoft/Intune-Config-Frameworks/blob/master/iOS/Supervised/Apple-App-BundleIDs.csv) (opens a Microsoft GitHub site).
