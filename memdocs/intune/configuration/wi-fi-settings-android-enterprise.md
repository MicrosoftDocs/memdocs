# Add Wi-Fi settings for Android Enterprise dedicated and fully managed devices in Microsoft Intune

You can create a profile with specific Wi-Fi settings, and then deploy this profile to your Android Enterprise fully managed and dedicated devices. Microsoft Intune offers many features, including authenticating to your network, using a pre-shared key, and more.

This article describes these settings. [Use Wi-Fi on your devices](wi-fi-settings-configure.md) includes more information about the Wi-Fi feature in Microsoft Intune.

## Before you begin

[Create a device profile](wi-fi-settings-configure.md).

## Device owner only

Select this option if you are deploying to an Android Enterprise dedicated or fully managed device.  Android Enterprise dedicated and fully managed devices currently support SCEP certificate deployment, but not PKCS.

### Basic

- **Wi-Fi type**: Choose **Basic**.
- **Network name**: Enter a name for this Wi-Fi connection. End users see this name when they browse their device for available Wi-FI connections. For example, enter **Contoso WiFi**.
- **SSID**: Enter the **service set identifier**, which is the real name of the wireless network that devices connect to. However, users only see the **network name** you configured when they choose the connection.
- **Hidden network**: Choose **Enable** to hide this network from the list of available networks on the device. The SSID isn't broadcasted. Choose **Disable** to show this network in the list of available networks on the device.
- **Wi-Fi type**: Select the security protocol to authenticate to the Wi-Fi network. Your options:

  - **Open (no authentication)**: Only use this option if the network is unsecured.
  - **WEP-Pre-shared key**: Enter the password in **Pre-shared key**. When your organization's network is set up or configured, a password or network key is also configured. Enter this password or network key for the PSK value.
  - **WPA-Pre-shared key**: Enter the password in **Pre-shared key**. When your organization's network is set up or configured, a password or network key is also configured. Enter this password or network key for the PSK value.

### Enterprise

- **Wi-Fi type**: Choose **Enterprise**.
- **SSID**: Enter the **service set identifier**, which is the real name of the wireless network that devices connect to. However, users only see the **network name** you configured when they choose the connection.
- **Hidden network**: Choose **Enable** to hide this network from the list of available networks on the device. The SSID isn't broadcasted. Choose **Disable** to show this network in the list of available networks on the device.
- **EAP type**: Choose the Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) type used to authenticate secured wireless connections. Your options:

  - **EAP-TLS**: Also enter:

    - **Server Trust** - **Root certificate for server validation**: Choose an existing trusted root certificate profile. When the client connects to the network, this certificate is presented to the server, and authenticates the connection.

    - **Client Authentication** - **Client certificate for client authentication (Identity certificate)**: Choose the SCEP client certificate profile that is also deployed to the device. This certificate is the identity presented by the device to the server to authenticate the connection.

    - **Identity privacy (outer identity)**: Enter the text sent in the response to an EAP identity request. This text can be any value, such as `anonymous`. During authentication, this anonymous identity is initially sent, and then followed by the real identification sent in a secure tunnel.â€‹

  - **EAP-TTLS**: Also enter:

    - **Server Trust** - **Root certificate for server validation**: Choose an existing trusted root certificate profile. When the client connects to the network, this certificate is presented to the server, and authenticates the connection.

    - **Client Authentication**: Choose an **Authentication method**. Your options:

      - **Username and Password**: Prompt the user for a user name and password to authenticate the connection. Also enter:
        - **Non-EAP method (inner identity)**: Choose how you authenticate the connection. Be sure you choose the same protocol that's configured on your Wi-Fi network. Your options:

          - **Unencrypted password (PAP)**
          - **Microsoft CHAP (MS-CHAP)**
          - **Microsoft CHAP Version 2 (MS-CHAP v2)**

      - **Certificates**: Choose the SCEP client certificate profile that is also deployed to the device. This certificate is the identity presented by the device to the server to authenticate the connection.

      - **Identity privacy (outer identity)**: Enter the text sent in the response to an EAP identity request. This text can be any value, such as `anonymous`. During authentication, this anonymous identity is initially sent, and then followed by the real identification sent in a secure tunnel.

  - **PEAP**: Also enter:

    - **Server Trust** - **Root certificate for server validation**: Choose an existing trusted root certificate profile. When the client connects to the network, this certificate is presented to the server, and authenticates the connection.

    - **Client Authentication**: Choose an **Authentication method**. Your options:

      - **Username and Password**: Prompt the user for a user name and password to authenticate the connection. Also enter:
        - **Non-EAP method for authentication (inner identity)**: Choose how you authenticate the connection. Be sure you choose the same protocol that's configured on your Wi-Fi network. Your options:

          - **None**
          - **Microsoft CHAP Version 2 (MS-CHAP v2)**

      - **Certificates**: Choose the SCEP client certificate profile that is also deployed to the device. This certificate is the identity presented by the device to the server to authenticate the connection.

      - **Identity privacy (outer identity)**: Enter the text sent in the response to an EAP identity request. This text can be any value, such as `anonymous`. During authentication, this anonymous identity is initially sent, and then followed by the real identification sent in a secure tunnel.

## Next steps

The profile is created, but it's not doing anything. Next, [assign this profile](device-profile-assign.md) and [monitor its status.](device-profile-monitor.md).

You can also create Wi-Fi profiles for [Android](wi-fi-settings-android.md), [iOS/iPadOS](wi-fi-settings-ios.md), [macOS](wi-fi-settings-macos.md), [Windows 10](wi-fi-settings-windows.md), and [Windows 8.1](wi-fi-settings-import-windows-8-1.md) devices.
