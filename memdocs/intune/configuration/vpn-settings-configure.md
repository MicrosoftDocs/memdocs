# Create VPN profiles to connect to VPN servers in Intune

Virtual private networks (VPNs) give users secure remote access to your organization network. Devices use a VPN connection profile to start a connection with the VPN server. **VPN profiles** in Microsoft Intune assign VPN settings to users and devices in your organization, so they can easily and securely connect to your organizational network.

For example, you want to configure all iOS/iPadOS devices with the required settings to connect to a file share on the organization network. You create a VPN profile that includes these settings. Then, you assign this profile to all users who have iOS/iPadOS devices. The users see the VPN connection in the list of available networks, and can connect with minimal effort.

> [!NOTE]
> You can use [Intune custom configuration policies](custom-settings-configure.md) to create VPN profiles for the following platforms:
>
> * Android 4 and later
> * Enrolled devices that run Windows 8.1 and later
> * Windows Phone 8.1 and later
> * Enrolled devices that run Windows 10 desktop
> * Windows 10 Mobile
> * Windows Holographic for Business

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Before you can use VPN profiles assigned to a device, you must install the applicable VPN app for the profile. To help you assign the app using Intune, see [What is app management in Microsoft Intune?](../apps/app-management.md).  

## Create the profile

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431).
2. Select **Devices** > **Configuration profiles** > **Create profile**.
3. Enter the following properties:

    - **Platform**: Choose the platform of your devices. Your options:
      - **Android device administrator**
      - **Android Enterprise** > **Device owner only**
      - **Android Enterprise** > **Work profile only**
      - **iOS/iPadOS**
      - **macOS**
      - **Windows 10 and later**
      - **Windows 8.1 and later**
      - **Windows Phone 8.1**
    - **Profile**: Select **VPN**.

4. Select **Create**.
5. In **Basics**, enter the following properties:

    - **Name**: Enter a descriptive name for the profile. Name your profiles so you can easily identify them later. For example, a good profile name is **VPN profile for entire company**.
    - **Description**: Enter a description for the profile. This setting is optional, but recommended.

6. Select **Next**.
7. In **Configuration settings**, depending on the platform you chose, the settings you can configure are different. Select your platform for detailed settings:

    - [Android device administrator](vpn-settings-android.md)
    - [Android Enterprise](vpn-settings-android-enterprise.md)
    - [iOS/iPadOS](vpn-settings-ios.md)
    - [macOS](vpn-settings-macos.md)
    - [Windows 10](vpn-settings-windows-10.md) (including Windows Holographic for Business)
    - [Windows 8.1](vpn-settings-windows-8-1.md)
    - [Windows Phone 8.1](vpn-settings-windows-phone-8-1.md)

8. Select **Next**.
9. In **Scope tags** (optional), assign a tag to filter the profile to specific IT groups, such as `US-NC IT Team` or `JohnGlenn_ITDepartment`. For more information about scope tags, see [Use RBAC and scope tags for distributed IT](../fundamentals/scope-tags.md).

    Select **Next**.

10. In **Assignments**, select the user or groups that will receive your profile. For more information on assigning profiles, see [Assign user and device profiles](device-profile-assign.md).

    Select **Next**.

11. In **Review + create**, review your settings. When you select **Create**, your changes are saved, and the profile is assigned. The policy is also shown in the profiles list.

## Secure your VPN profiles

VPN profiles can use a number of different connection types and protocols from different manufacturers. These connections are typically secured through the following methods.

### Certificates

When you create the VPN profile, you choose a SCEP or PKCS certificate profile that you previously created in Intune. This profile is known as the identity certificate. It's used to authenticate against a trusted certificate profile (or *root certificate*) that you create to allow the user's device to connect. The trusted certificate is assigned to the computer that authenticates the VPN connection, typically, the VPN server.

If you use certificate based authentication for your VPN profile, deploy the VPN profile, certificate profile, and trusted root profile to the same groups to ensure that each device can recognize the legitimacy of your certificate authority.

For more information about how to create and use certificate profiles in Intune, see [How to configure certificates with Microsoft Intune](../protect/certificates-configure.md).

### User name and password

The user authenticates to the VPN server by providing a user name and password.

## Next steps

Once the profile is created, it isn't doing anything yet. Next, [assign the profile](device-profile-assign.md) to some devices, and [monitor its status](device-profile-monitor.md).

You can also create and use per-app VPNs on [Android device administrator/Android Enterprise](android-pulse-secure-per-app-vpn.md) and [iOS/iPadOS](vpn-setting-configure-per-app.md) devices.
