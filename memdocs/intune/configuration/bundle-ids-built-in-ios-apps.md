# Bundle IDs for built-in iOS and iPadOS apps you can use in Intune

When you configure features on iOS/iPadOS devices, you can also add the built-in apps on these devices. This article lists the bundle IDs of some common built-in iOS/iPadOS apps.

To get the bundle ID of other apps, you can:

- [Get the app bundle ID using the Intune admin center](../apps/get-app-bundle-id-intune-admin-center.md).
- Go to Apple's list of [iOS/iPadOS bundle IDs](https://support.apple.com/guide/deployment/bundle-ids-for-native-ios-and-ipados-apps-depece748c41/1/web/1.0) (opens Apple's web site).

> [!TIP]
> On macOS devices, you can get the bundle ID using the Terminal app and AppleScript: `osascript -e 'id of app "AppName"'`.

This feature applies to:

- iOS/iPadOS
