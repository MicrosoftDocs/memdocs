# Add Wi-Fi settings for Windows 10 and newer devices in Intune

> [!NOTE]
> [!INCLUDE [not-all-settings-are-documented](../includes/not-all-settings-are-documented.md)]

You can create a profile with specific WiFi settings. Then, deploy this profile to your Windows 10 and newer devices. Microsoft Intune offers many features, including authenticating to your network, using a pre-shared key, and more.

This article describes some of these settings.

## Before you begin

Create a [Windows 10 Wi-Fi device configuration profile](wi-fi-settings-configure.md).

These settings use the [Wi-Fi CSP](/windows/client-management/mdm/wifi-csp).

## Basic profile

Basic or personal profiles use WPA/WPA2 to secure the Wi-Fi connection on devices. Typically, WPA/WPA2 is used on home networks or personal networks. You can also add a pre-shared key to authenticate the connection.

- **Wi-Fi type**: Select **Basic**.

- **Wi-Fi name (SSID)**: Short for service set identifier. This value is the real name of the wireless network that devices connect to. However, users only see the **Connection name** you configure when they choose the connection.

- **Connection name**: Enter a user-friendly name for this Wi-Fi connection. The text you enter is the name users see when they browse the available connections on their device. For example, enter `ContosoWiFi`.

- **Connect automatically when in range**: When **Yes**, devices connect automatically when they're in range of this network. When **No**, devices don't automatically connect.

  - **Connect to more preferred network if available**: If the devices are in range of a more preferred network, then select **Yes** to use the preferred network. Select **No** to use the Wi-Fi network in this configuration profile.

    For example, you create a **ContosoCorp** Wi-Fi network, and use **ContosoCorp** within this configuration profile. You also have a **ContosoGuest** Wi-Fi network within range. When your corporate devices are within range, you want them to automatically connect to **ContosoCorp**. In this scenario, set the **Connect to more preferred network if available** property to **No**.

  - **Connect to this network, even when it is not broadcasting its SSID**: Select **Yes** to automatically connect to your network, even when the network is hidden. Meaning, its service set identifier (SSID) isn't broadcast publicly. Select **No** if you don't want this configuration profile to connect to your hidden network.

- **Metered Connection Limit**: An administrator can choose how the network's traffic is metered. Applications can then adjust their network traffic behavior based on this setting. Your options:

  - **Unrestricted**: Default. The connection isn't metered and there are no restrictions on traffic.
  - **Fixed**: Use this option if the network is configured with fixed limit for network traffic. After this limit is reached, network access is prohibited.
  - **Variable**: Used this option if network traffic is charged per byte (cost per byte).

- **Wireless Security Type**: Enter the security protocol used to authenticate devices on your network. Your options are:
  - **Open (no authentication)**: Only use this option if the network is unsecured.
  - **WPA/WPA2-Personal**: A more secure option, and is commonly used for Wi-Fi connectivity. For more security, you can also enter a pre-shared key password or network key.

    - **Pre-shared key** (PSK): Optional. Shown when you choose **WPA/WPA2-Personal** as the security type. When your organization's network is set up or configured, a password or network key is also configured. Enter this password or network key for the PSK value. Enter a string between 8-64 characters. If your password or network key is 64 characters, enter hexadecimal characters.

      > [!IMPORTANT]
      > The PSK is the same for all devices you target the profile to. If the key is compromised, it can be used by any device to connect to the Wi-Fi network. Keep your PSKs secure to avoid unauthorized access.

- **Company proxy settings**: Select to use the proxy settings within your organization. Your options:
  - **None**: No proxy settings are configured.
  - **Manually configure**: Enter the **Proxy server IP address** and its **Port number**.
  - **Automatically configure**: Enter the URL pointing to a proxy autoconfiguration (PAC) script. For example, enter `http://proxy.contoso.com/proxy.pac`.

    For more information on PAC files, see [Proxy Auto-Configuration (PAC) file](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/Proxy_servers_and_tunneling/Proxy_Auto-Configuration_(PAC)_file) (opens a non-Microsoft site).

## Enterprise profile

Enterprise profiles use Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) to authenticate Wi-Fi connections. EAP is often used by enterprises, as you can use certificates to authenticate and secure connections. And, configure more security options.

- **Wi-Fi type**: Select **Enterprise**.

- **Wi-Fi name (SSID)**: Short for service set identifier. This value is the real name of the wireless network that devices connect to. However, users only see the **Connection name** you configure when they choose the connection.

- **Connection name**: Enter a user-friendly name for this Wi-Fi connection. The text you enter is the name users see when they browse the available connections on their device. For example, enter `ContosoWiFi`.

- **Connect automatically when in range**: When **Yes**, devices connect automatically when they're in range of this network. When **No**, devices don't automatically connect.
  - **Connect to more preferred network if available**: If the devices are in range of a more preferred network, then select **Yes** to use the preferred network. Select **No** to use the Wi-Fi network in this configuration profile.

    For example, you create a **ContosoCorp** Wi-Fi network, and use **ContosoCorp** within this configuration profile. You also have a **ContosoGuest** Wi-Fi network within range. When your corporate devices are within range, you want them to automatically connect to **ContosoCorp**. In this scenario, set the **Connect to more preferred network if available** property to **No**.

- **Connect to this network, even when it is not broadcasting its SSID**: Select **Yes** for the configuration profile to automatically connect to your network, even when the network is hidden (meaning, its SSID isn't broadcast publicly). Select **No** if you don't want this configuration profile to connect to your hidden network.

- **Metered Connection Limit**: An administrator can choose how the network's traffic is metered. Applications can then adjust their network traffic behavior based on this setting. Your options:

  - **Unrestricted**: Default. The connection isn't metered and there are no restrictions on traffic.
  - **Fixed**: Use this option if the network is configured with fixed limit for network traffic. After this limit is reached, network access is prohibited.
  - **Variable**: Use this option if network traffic is costed per byte.

- **Authentication mode**: Select how the Wi-Fi profile authenticates with the Wi-Fi server. Your options:
  - **Not configured**: Intune doesn't change or update this setting. By default, **User or machine** authentication is used.
  - **User**: The user account signed in to the device authenticates to the Wi-Fi network.
  - **Machine**: Device credentials authenticate to the Wi-Fi network.
  - **User or machine**: When a user is signed in to the device, user credentials authenticate to the Wi-Fi network. When no users are signed in, then device credentials authenticate.
  - **Guest**: No credentials are associated with the Wi-Fi network. Authentication is either open, or handled externally, such as through a web page.

- **Remember credentials at each logon**: Select to cache user credentials, or if users must enter them every time when connecting to Wi-Fi. Your options:

  - **Not configured**: Intune doesn't change or update this setting. By default, the OS might enable this feature, and cache the credentials.
  - **Enable**: Caches user credentials when entered the first time users connect to the Wi-Fi network. Cached credentials are used for future connections, and users don't need to reenter them.
  - **Disable**: User credentials aren't remembered or cached. When connecting to Wi-Fi, users must enter their credentials every time.

- **Authentication period**: Enter the number of seconds devices must wait after trying to authenticate, from 1-3600. If the device doesn't connect in the time you enter, then authentication fails. If you leave this value empty or blank, then `18` seconds is used.

- **Authentication retry delay period**: Enter the number of seconds between a failed authentication attempt and the next authentication attempt, from 1-3600. If you leave this value empty or blank, then `1` second is used.

- **Start period**: Enter the number of seconds to wait before sending an EAPOL-Start message, from 1-3600. If you leave this value empty or blank, then `5` seconds is used.

- **Maximum EAPOL-start**: Enter the number of EAPOL-Start messages, from 1 and 100. If you leave this value empty or blank, then a maximum of `3` messages are sent.

- **Maximum authentication failures**: Enter the maximum number of authentication failures for this set of credentials to authenticate, from 1-100. If you leave this value empty or blank, then `1` attempt is used.

- **Single sign-on (SSO)**: Allows you to configure single sign-on (SSO), where credentials are shared for computer and Wi-Fi network sign-in. Your options:
  - **Disable**: Disables SSO behavior. The user needs to authenticate to the network separately.
  - **Enable before user signs into device**: Use SSO to authenticate to the network just before the user sign-in process.
  - **Enable after user signs into device**: Use SSO to authenticate to the network immediately after the user sign-in process completes.
  - **Maximum time to authenticate before timeout**: Enter the maximum number of seconds to wait before authenticating to the network, from 1-120 seconds.
  - **Allow Windows to prompt user for additional authentication credentials**: **Yes** allows the Windows system to prompt the user for more credentials, if the authentication method requires it. Select **No** to hide these prompts.

- **Enable pairwise master key (PMK) caching**: Select **Yes** to cache the PMK used in authentication. This caching typically allows authentication to the network to complete faster. Select **No** to force the authentication handshake when connecting to the Wi-Fi network every time.

  - **Maximum time a PMK is stored in cache**: Enter the number of minutes a pairwise master key (PMK) is stored in the cache, from 5-1440 minutes.
  - **Maximum number of PMKs stored in cache**: Enter the number of keys stored in cache, from 1-255.
  - **Enable pre-authentication**: Pre-authentication allows the profile to authenticate to all access points for the network in the profile before connecting. When moving between access points, pre-authentication reconnects the user or devices more quickly. Select **Yes** for the profile to authenticate to all access points for this network that are within range. Select **No** to require the user or device to authenticate to each access point separately.
  - **Maximum pre-authentication attempts**: Enter the number of tries to preauthenticate, from 1-16.

- **EAP type**: Select the Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) type to authenticate secured wireless connections. Your options:

  - **EAP-SIM**
  - **EAP-TLS**: Also enter:

    - **Certificate server names**: Enter one or more common names used in the certificates issued by your trusted certificate authority (CA). If you enter this information, you can bypass the dynamic trust dialog shown on user devices when they connect to this Wi-Fi network.
    - **Root certificates for server validation**: Select the trusted root certificate profile used to authenticate the connection.
    - **Authentication method**: Select the authentication method used by your device clients. Your options:

      - **SCEP certificate**: Select the SCEP client certificate profile that is also deployed to the device. This certificate is the identity presented by the device to the server to authenticate the connection.
      - **PKCS certificate**: Select the PKCS **client certificate** profile and trusted **root certificate** that are also deployed to the device. The client certificate is the identity presented by the device to the server to authenticate the connection.

    - **Root certificate for server validation**: Select the trusted root certificate profile used to authenticate the connection.  

    - **Perform server validation**: When set to **Yes**, in PEAP negotiation phase 1, devices validate the certificate, and verify the server. Select **No** to block or prevent this validation. When set to **Not configured**, Intune doesn't change or update this setting.

      If you select **Yes**, also configure:

      - **Disable user prompts for server validation**: When set to **Yes**, in PEAP negotiation phase 1, user prompts asking to authorize new PEAP servers for trusted certification authorities aren't shown. Select **No** to show the prompts. When set to **Not configured**, Intune doesn't change or update this setting.

    - **Require cryptographic binding**: **Yes** prevents connections to PEAP servers that don't use cryptobinding during the PEAP negotiation. **No** doesn't require cryptobinding. When set to **Not configured**, Intune doesn't change or update this setting.

    - **Authentication method**: Select the authentication method used by your device clients. Your options:

- **Force Wi-Fi profile to be compliant with the Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS)**: Select **Yes** when validating against the FIPS 140-2 standard. This standard is required for all US federal government agencies that use cryptography-based security systems to protect sensitive but unclassified information stored digitally. Select **No** to not be FIPS-compliant.

## Use an imported settings file

For any settings not available in Intune, you can export Wi-Fi settings from another Windows device. This export creates an XML file with all the settings. Then, import this file in to Intune, and use it as the Wi-Fi profile. See [Export and import Wi-Fi settings for Windows devices](wi-fi-settings-import-windows-8-1.md).

## Next steps

The profile is created, but may not be doing anything. Be sure to [assign the profile](device-profile-assign.md), and [monitor its status](device-profile-monitor.md).
