# Android and Samsung Knox Standard device restriction settings lists in Intune

This article shows you all the Microsoft Intune device restrictions settings that you can configure for devices running Android. As part of your mobile device management (MDM) solution, use these settings to allow or disable features, set password requirements, control security, and more.

This feature applies to:

- Android device administrator (DA)

  [!INCLUDE [android_device_administrator_support](../includes/android-device-administrator-support.md)]

>[!TIP]
>If the settings you want are not available, you might be able to configure your devices using a [custom profile](custom-settings-android.md).

## Before you begin

Create an [Android device administrator device restrictions configuration profile](device-restrictions-configure.md).

## General

- **Camera (Android 9 and earlier, Samsung KNOX Android 15 and earlier only)**: **Block** prevents access to the device camera. When set to **Not configured** (default), Intune doesn't change or update this setting. By default, the OS might allow access to the device camera.

  Intune only manages access to the device camera. It doesn't have access to pictures or videos.

- **Copy and paste (Samsung Knox only)**: **Block** prevents copy-and-paste. **Not configured** allows copy and paste functions on devices.
- **Clipboard sharing between apps (Samsung Knox only)**: **Block** prevents using the clipboard to copy-and-paste between apps. When set to **Not configured** (default), Intune doesn't change or update this setting. By default, the OS might allow copy and paste functions on devices.
- **Diagnostic data submission (Samsung Knox only)**: **Block** stops users from submitting bug reports from devices. When set to **Not configured** (default), Intune doesn't change or update this setting. By default, the OS might allow users to submit the data.
- **Factory reset (Samsung KNOX Android 15 and earlier only)**: **Block** prevents users from factory resetting the device. When set to **Not configured** (default), Intune doesn't change or update this setting.
- **Geolocation (Samsung Knox only)**: **Block** disables devices from using location information. When set to **Not configured** (default), Intune doesn't change or update this setting. By default, the OS might allow devices to use the location information.
- **Power off (Samsung Knox only)**: **Block** prevents users from powering off device. It also prevents the **Number of sign-in failures before wiping device** setting from being configured, and from working. When set to **Not configured** (default), Intune doesn't change or update this setting. By default, the OS might allow users to power off devices.
- **Screen capture (Samsung KNOX Android 15 and earlier only)**: **Block** prevents screenshots. When set to **Not configured** (default), Intune doesn't change or update this setting. By default, the OS might let users capture the screen contents as an image.
- **Voice assistant (Samsung KNOX Android 15 and earlier only)**: **Block** disables the S Voice service. When set to **Not configured** (default), Intune doesn't change or update this setting. By default, the OS might allow using the S Voice service and app on devices. This setting doesn't apply to Bixby or the voice assistant for accessibility that reads the screen content aloud.
- **YouTube (Samsung Knox only)**: **Block** prevents users from using the YouTube app. When set to **Not configured** (default), Intune doesn't change or update this setting. By default, the OS might allow using the YouTube app on devices.
- **Shared devices (Samsung Knox only)**: Configure a managed Samsung Knox Standard device as shared. **Allow** lets users sign in and out of devices with their Microsoft Entra credentials. Devices stay managed, whether they're in use or not.

  When used in with a SCEP certificate profile, this feature allows users to share a device with the same apps for all users. But, each user has their own SCEP user certificate. When users sign out, all app data is cleared. This feature is limited to LOB apps only.

  When set to **Not configured** (default), Intune doesn't change or update this setting. By default, the OS might prevent multiple users from signing in to the Company Portal app on devices using their Microsoft Entra credentials.
- **Block date and time changes (Samsung KNOX Android 15 and earlier only)**: **Block** prevents users from changing the date and time settings on devices. When set to **Not configured** (default), Intune doesn't change or update this setting. By default, the OS might allow users to change the date and time settings.

## Password

- **Encryption**: Select **Require** so that files on the device are encrypted. Not all devices support encryption. When set to **Not configured** (default), Intune doesn't change or update this setting. To configure this setting, and correctly report compliance, also configure:
  1. **Password**: Set to **Require**.
  2. **Required password type**: Set to **At least numeric**.
  3. **Minimum password length**: Set to at least `4`.

  > [!NOTE]
  > If an encryption policy is enforced, Samsung Knox devices require users to set a 6-character complex password as the device passcode.

### All Android devices

These settings apply to all Android OS versions and manufacturers, except where specified.

- **Maximum minutes of inactivity until screen locks**: Enter the length of time a device must be idle before the screen is automatically locked. For example, enter `5` to lock devices after 5 minutes of being idle. When the value is blank or set to **Not configured**, Intune doesn't change or update this setting.

  On a device, users can't set a time value greater than the configured time in the profile. Users can set a lower time value. For example, if the profile is set to `15` minutes, users can set the value to 5 minutes. Users can't set the value to 30 minutes.

- **Number of sign-in failures before wiping device (Samsung KNOX Android 15 and earlier only)**: Enter the number of wrong passwords allowed before devices are wiped, from 4-11. `0` (zero) might disable device wipe functionality. When the value is blank, Intune doesn't change or update this setting.

- **Password**: **Require** users to enter a password to access devices. When set to **Not configured** (default), Intune doesn't change or update this setting. By default, the OS might allow users to access devices without entering a password.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Samsung Knox devices automatically require a 4-digit PIN during MDM enrollment. Native Android devices may automatically require a PIN to become compliant with Conditional Access.

### Android 10 and later

- **Password complexity**: Enter the required password complexity. Your options:

  - **None** (default): No password required.
  - **Low**: The password satisfies one of the following conditions:
    - Pattern
    - Numeric PIN has a repeating (4444) or ordered (1234, 4321, 2468) sequence.
  - **Medium**: The password satisfies one of the following conditions:
    - Numeric PIN doesn't have a repeating (4444) or ordered (1234, 4321, 2468) sequence, and has minimum length of 4.
    - Alphabetic, with a minimum length of 4.
    - Alphanumeric, with a minimum length of 4.
  - **High**: The password satisfies one of the following conditions:
    - Numeric PIN doesn't have a repeating (4444) or ordered (1234, 4321, 2468) sequence, and has minimum length of 8.
    - Alphabetic, with a minimum length of 6.
    - Alphanumeric, with a minimum length of 6.

  This setting applies to:  
  - Android 10 and newer, but not on Samsung Knox.

  > [!IMPORTANT]
  > The **Password complexity** setting is a work in progress. In late October 2020, **Password complexity** will take effect on devices.
  >
  > If you set **Password complexity** to something other than **None**, then also set the **Password** setting to **Require**, which is found under the *All Android devices* section. Users with passwords that don't meet your complexity requirements receive a warning to update their password. If you don't set the **Password** setting to **Require**, users with weak passwords won't receive the warning.

### Android 9 and earlier, or Samsung Knox Android 15 and earlier

These settings apply to devices running Android 9 or earlier, and all Samsung Knox devices running any Android OS version 15 and earlier.

- **Minimum password length**: Enter the minimum number of characters required, from 4-16. For example, enter `6` to require at least six numbers or characters in the password length.

- **Password expiration (days)**: Enter the number of days, until the device password must be changed, from 1-365. For example, enter `90` to expire the password after 90 days. When the password expires, users are prompted to create a new password. When the value is blank, Intune doesn't change or update this setting.

- **Required password type**: Enter the required password complexity level, and whether biometric devices can be used. Your options:
  - **Device default**
  - **Low security biometric**: [Strong vs. weak biometrics](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2018/06/better-biometrics-in-android-p.html) (opens Android's web site)
  - **At least numeric**: Includes numeric characters, like `123456789`.
  - **Numeric complex**: Repeated or consecutive numbers, like "1111" or "1234", aren't allowed. Before you assign this setting to devices, be sure to update the Company Portal app to the latest version on those devices.

    When set to **Numeric complex**, and you assign the setting to devices running an Android version earlier than 5.0, then the following behavior applies:

    - If the Company Portal app is running a version earlier than 1704, no PIN policy applies to devices, and an error shows in the Microsoft Intune admin center.
    - If the Company Portal app runs the 1704 version or later, only a simple PIN can be applied. Android version earlier than 5.0 don't support this setting. No error is shown in the Microsoft Intune admin center.

  - **At least alphabetic**: Includes letters in the alphabet. Numbers and symbols aren't required.
  - **At least alphanumeric**: Includes uppercase letters, lowercase letters, and numeric characters.
  - **At least alphanumeric with symbols**: Includes uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numeric characters, punctuation marks, and symbols.

- **Prevent reuse of previous passwords**: Use this setting to restrict users from creating previously used passwords. Enter the number of previously used passwords that can't be used, from 1-24. For example, enter `5` so users can't set a new password to their current password or any of their previous four passwords. When the value is blank, Intune doesn't change or update this setting.

- **Fingerprint unlock (Samsung Knox only)**: **Block** prevents using a fingerprint to unlock devices. When set to **Not configured** (default), Intune doesn't change or update this setting.By default, the OS might allow users to unlock devices using a fingerprint.

- **Smart Lock and other trust agents**: **Block** prevents Smart Lock or other trust agents from adjusting lock screen settings. If the device is in a trusted location, then this feature, also known as a trust agent, lets you disable or bypass the device lock screen password. For example, use this feature when devices are connected to a specific Bluetooth device, or when devices are close to an NFC tag. You can use this setting to prevent users from configuring Smart Lock.

  When set to **Not configured** (default), Intune doesn't change or update this setting.

  This setting applies to:  
  - Samsung KNOX Standard 5.0 and newer

## Google Play Store
