# Apple device configuration list in the Intune settings catalog

This article lists and describes the Apple configurations you can manage using a settings catalog policy in Microsoft Intune. 

This article applies to:

- iOS/iPadOS
- macOS

## Before you begin

- At a minimum, sign into the Intune admin center as a member of the **Policy and Profile Manager** role. For more information on the built-in Intune roles, go to [Role-based access control (RBAC) with Microsoft Intune](../fundamentals/role-based-access-control.md).
- Create a [settings catalog policy](settings-catalog.md).

### How to use this article

This article covers the two types of configurations from Apple's mobile device management (MDM) protocol:

- Apple declarative configurations
- Apple MDM payloads

Each section can have links to other documents:

- **Apple platform guides**: The Apple Platform Deployment and Security guides that cover deployment and security features of Apple technology
- **Apple developer**: The developer documentation outlines the device management API that gets updated with every OS release
- **Apple YAML**: Apple GitHub repository that contains setting definitions that are ingested into the settings catalog. Use this information to see requirements like applicable OS version, enrollment types, and if supervision is required
- **Intune documentation**: Intune guides for scenario-based configuration like setting up Platform Single Sign On or deploying declarative software updates
- **Known issues**: Updated list of known issues related to each configuration

Some settings are available in device configuration templates and in the settings catalog. To help with a manual policy migration, this article lists the template settings that maps to their equivalent setting in the settings catalog.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> It's recommended to create all new policies using the settings catalog where possible. Some of the existing device configuration templates are no longer being updated. In a future Intune release, they will be migrated to use the settings catalog policy type and the ability to create new templates will be deprecated. These templates include:
> 
> - Device features 
> - Device restrictions 
> - Endpoint protection (Deprecated) 
> - Extensions (Deprecated)
>   
> Policies that should still be created using templates include:
> 
> - Derived credential
> - Email
> - PKCS certificate
> - PKCS imported certificate
> - SCEP certificate
> - Trusted certificate
> - VPN
> - Wi-Fi
> - Wired network

## Apple declarative configurations

This section is specific to the configurations that are under the Declarative Device Management (DDM) category in the settings catalog.
