# Add VPN settings on Windows Phone 8.1 devices in Microsoft Intune

[!INCLUDE [windows-phone-81-windows-10-mobile-support](../includes/windows-phone-81-windows-10-mobile-support.md)]

This article shows you the Intune settings you can use to configure VPN connections on devices running Windows Phone 8.1. 

Depending on the settings you choose, not all values in the following list are configurable.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>Windows Phone 8.1 VPN profiles are also applied to Windows 10 devices.

## Before you begin

[Create a VPN device configuration profile](vpn-settings-configure.md).

## Base VPN settings

- **Connection name**: Enter a name for this connection. Users see this name when they browse their device for the list of available VPN connections.
- **Authentication method**: Choose how devices authenticate to the VPN server from:
  - **Certificates**: Under **Authentication certificate**, Choose a SCEP or PKCS certificate profile you previously created to authenticate the connection. For more information about certificate profiles, see [How to configure certificates](../protect/certificates-configure.md).
  - **Username and password**: End users must supply a username and password to log into the VPN server.
- **Servers**: Add one or more VPN servers that devices connect to.
  - **Add**: Opens the **Add Row** blade where you can specify the following information:
    - **Description**: Specify a descriptive name for the server like **Contoso VPN server**.
    - **IP address or FQDN**: Provide the IP address or fully qualified domain name of the VPN server that devices connect to. Examples: **192.168.1.1**, **vpn.contoso.com**.
    - **Default server**: Enables this server as the default server that devices use to establish the connection. Make sure to set only one server as the default.
  - **Import**: Browse to a comma-separated file with a list of servers in the format description, IP address or FQDN, Default server. Choose **OK** to import these servers into the **Servers** list.
  - **Export**: Exports the list of servers to a comma-separated-values (csv) file.

- **Bypass VPN on company Wi-Fi network**: Enable this option to specify that the VPN connections aren't used when the device is connected to the company Wi-Fi network.
- **Bypass VPN on home Wi-Fi network**: Enable this option to specify that the VPN connection isn't used when the device is connected to a home Wi-Fi network.

- **Connection type**: Select the VPN connection type. Your options:
  - **Check Point Capsule VPN**
  - **SonicWall Mobile Connect**
  - **F5 Edge Client**
  - **Pulse Secure**

- **Login group or domain** (SonicWall Mobile Connect only): Specify the name of the login group or domain that you want to connect to.
- **Role** (Pulse Secure only): Specify the name of the user role that has access to this connection. A user role defines personal settings and options, and it enables or disables certain access features.
- **Realm** (Pulse Secure only): Specify the name of the authentication realm that you want to use. An authentication realm is a grouping of authentication resources that the Pulse Secure connection type uses.

- **DNS suffix search list**: **Add** one or more DNS suffices. Each DNS suffix that you specify is searched when connecting to a website by using a short name. For example, specify the DNS suffixes **domain1.contoso.com** and **domain2.contoso.com**, visit the URL `http://mywebsite`, and the URLs `http://mywebsite.domain1.contoso.com` and `http://mywebsite.domain2.contoso.com` is searched.

- **Custom XML**: Specify any custom XML commands that configure the VPN connection.

  **Pulse Secure example**:

  ```xml
  <pulse-schema><isSingleSignOnCredential>true</isSingleSignOnCredential></pulse-schema>
  ```

  **CheckPoint Mobile VPN example**:

  ```xml
  <CheckPointVPN port="443" name="CheckPointSelfhost" sso="true" debug="3" />
  ```

  **SonicWall Mobile Connect example**:

  ```xml
  <MobileConnect><Compression>false</Compression><debugLogging>True</debugLogging><packetCapture>False</packetCapture></MobileConnect>
  ```

  **F5 Edge Client example**:

  ```xml
  <f5-vpn-conf><single-sign-on-credential /></f5-vpn-conf>
  ```

  For more information on writing custom XML commands, see the manufacturer's VPN documentation.

- **Split tunneling**: **Enable** lets devices decide which connection to use depending on the traffic. For example, a user in a hotel uses the VPN connection to access work files, but use the hotel's standard network for regular web browsing. If you want all traffic to use the VPN tunnel when the VPN connection is active, then set to **Disable**.

## Proxy settings

- **Automatically detect proxy settings**: If your VPN server requires a proxy server for the connection, specify whether you want devices to automatically detect the connection settings.
- **Automatic configuration script**: Use a file to configure the proxy server. Enter the **Proxy server URL** (for example `http://proxy.contoso.com`) which contains the configuration file.
- **Use proxy server**: Enable this option if you want to manually enter the proxy server settings.
  - **Address**: Enter the proxy server address (as an IP address).
  - **Port number**: Enter the port number associated with the proxy server.
- **Bypass proxy for local addresses**: If your VPN server requires a proxy server for the connection, and you don't want to use the proxy server for local addresses you enter, then select this option.

## Next steps

[Assign the profile](device-profile-assign.md), and [monitor its status](device-profile-monitor.md).

Configure VPN settings on [Android](vpn-settings-android.md), [Android Enterprise](vpn-settings-android-enterprise.md), [macOS](vpn-settings-macos.md), and [Windows 10](vpn-settings-windows-10.md) devices.
