# Windows Holographic for Business device settings to allow or restrict features using Intune

This article describes the different settings you can control on Windows Holographic for Business devices, such as Microsoft Hololens. As part of your mobile device management (MDM) solution, use these settings to allow or disable features, control security, and more.

As an Intune administrator, you can create and assign these settings to your devices.

## Before you begin

[Create a Windows 10 device restrictions configuration profile](device-restrictions-configure.md#create-the-profile).

When you create a Windows 10 device restrictions configuration profile, there are more settings than what's listed in this article. The settings in this article are supported on Windows Holographic for Business devices.

## App Store

- **Auto-update apps from store**: **Block** prevents updates from being automatically installed from the Microsoft Store. When set to **Not configured** (default), Intune doesn't change or update this setting. By default, the OS might allow apps installed from the Microsoft Store to be automatically updated.

  [ApplicationManagement/AllowAppStoreAutoUpdate CSP](/windows/client-management/mdm/policy-csp-applicationmanagement#applicationmanagement-allowappstoreautoupdate)

- **Trusted app installation**: Choose if non-Microsoft Store apps can be installed, also known as sideloading. Sideloading is installing, and then running or testing an app that isn't certified by the Microsoft Store. For example, an app that is internal to your company only. Your options:

  - **Block**: Prevents sideloading. Non-Microsoft Store apps can't be installed.
