# macOS device settings to allow or restrict features using Intune

This article describes the settings you can control and restrict on macOS devices. As part of your mobile device management (MDM) solution, use these settings to allow or disable features, set password rules, allow or restrict specific apps, and more.

These settings are added to a device configuration profile in Intune, and then assigned or deployed to your macOS devices.

> [!NOTE]
> The user interface may not match the enrollment types in this article. The information in this article is correct. The user interface is being updated in an upcoming release.

## Before you begin

Create a [macOS device restrictions configuration profile](device-restrictions-configure.md).

> [!NOTE]
> These settings apply to different enrollment types. For more information on the different enrollment types, see [macOS enrollment](../enrollment/macos-enroll.md).

  For more information on content caching on macOS, see [Manage content caching on Mac](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/manage-content-caching-on-mac-mchl3b6c3720/mac) (opens another website).

  This feature applies to:  
  - macOS 10.13 and newer

- **Block screenshots and screen recording**: Device must be enrolled in Apple's Automated Device Enrollment (DEP). **Yes** prevents users from saving screenshots of the display. It also prevents the Classroom app from observing remote screens. When set to **Not configured** (default), Intune doesn't change or update this setting. By default, the OS might allow users to capture screenshots, and allows the Classroom app to view remote screens.

### Settings apply to: User approved device enrollment, Automated device enrollment (supervised)

- **Defer software updates**: **Yes** allows you to delay when OS updates and non-OS updates are shown on devices. This setting doesn't control when updates are or aren't installed. When nothing is selected, Intune doesn't change or update this setting.

  By default, the OS might show updates on devices as Apple releases them. By default, software updates aren't delayed. If you configure this setting, then OS and non-OS software updates are delayed, depending on the options you select. The drop-down does exactly what you choose. It can delay both, delay neither, or delay one of them.

  For example, if a macOS update gets released by Apple on a specific date, then that update naturally shows on devices around the release date. Seed build updates are allowed without delay.  

  - **Delay visibility of software updates**: Enter a value from 0-90 days. By default, updates are delayed for `30` days. This value applies to the **Defer software updates** options you select. If you only select **Operating system updates**, then only OS updates are delayed for 30 days. If you select **Operating system updates** and **Non operating system updates**, then both are delayed for 30 days.

    When the delay expires, users get a notification to update to the earliest version available when the delay was triggered.

    For example, if a macOS update is available on **January 1**, and **Delay visibility** is set to **5 days**, then the update isn't shown as an available update. On the **sixth day** following the release, that update is available, and users can install it.

    This feature applies to:  
    - macOS 10.13.4 and newer

### Settings apply to: Automated device enrollment

- **Disable AirPlay, view screen by Classroom app, and screen sharing**: **Yes** blocks AirPlay, and prevents screen sharing to other devices. It also prevents teachers from using the Classroom app to see their students' screens. When set to **Not configured** (default), Intune doesn't change or update this setting. By default, the OS might allow teachers to see their students' screens.

  To use this setting, set the **Block screenshots and screen recording** setting to **Not configured** (screenshots are allowed).

- **Allow Classroom app to perform AirPlay and view screen without prompting**: **Yes** lets teachers see their students' screens without requiring students to agree. When set to **Not configured** (default), Intune doesn't change or update this setting. By default, the OS might require students to agree before teachers can see the screens.

  To use this setting, set the **Block screenshots and screen recording** setting to **Not configured** (screenshots are allowed).

- **Require teacher permission to leave Classroom app unmanaged classes**: **Yes** forces students enrolled in an unmanaged Classroom course to get teacher approval to leave the course. When set to **Not configured** (default), Intune doesn't change or update this setting. By default, the OS might allow students to leave the course whenever the student chooses.

- **Allow Classroom to lock the device without prompting**: **Yes** lets teachers lock a student's device or app without the student's approval. When set to **Not configured** (default), Intune doesn't change or update this setting. By default, the OS might require students agree before teachers can lock the device or app.

- **Students can automatically join Classroom class without prompting**: **Yes** lets students join a class without prompting the teacher. When set to **Not configured** (default), Intune doesn't change or update this setting. By default, the OS might require teacher approval to join a class.

## Password

These settings use the [Passcode payload](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/devicemanagement/passcode) (opens Apple's web site).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> 
> - On macOS devices running 10.14.2 to 11.x (except all versions of macOS 10.15 Catalina), users are prompted to change the device password when the device updates to a new major OS version. This password update happens once. After users update the password, any other password policies are enforced. If a passcode is required in at least one policy, then this behavior only occurs for the local machine user. 
>
> - Any time the password policy is updated, all users running these macOS versions must change the password, even if the current password is compliant with the new requirements. For example, when your macOS device turns on after upgrading to Big Sur (macOS 11), users need to change the device password before they can sign in.

### Settings apply to: All enrollment types

- **Require password**: **Yes** requires users to enter a password to access devices. When set to **Not configured** (default), Intune doesn't change or update this setting. By default, the OS might not require a password. It also doesn't force any restrictions, such as blocking simple passwords or setting a minimum length.
  - **Required password type**: Enter the required password complexity level your organization requires. When left blank, Intune doesn't change or update this setting. Your options:
    - **Not configured**: Uses the device default.
    - **Alphanumeric**: Includes uppercase letters, lowercase letters, and numeric characters.
    - **Numeric**: Password must only be numbers, such as 123456789.

    This feature applies to:  
    - macOS 10.10.3 and newer

  - **Number of non-alphanumeric characters in password**: Enter the number of complex characters required in the password, from 0-4. A complex character is a symbol, such as `?`. When left blank or set to **Not configured**, Intune doesn't change or update this setting.
  - **Minimum password length**: Enter the minimum length the password must have, from 4-16 characters. When left blank, Intune doesn't change or update this setting.
  - **Block simple passwords**: **Yes** prevents using simple passwords, such as `0000` or `1234`. When the value is blank or set to **Not configured**, Intune doesn't change or update this setting. By default, the OS might allow simple passwords.
  - **Maximum minutes of inactivity until screen locks**: Enter the length of time devices must be idle before the screen is automatically locked. For example, enter `5` to lock devices after 5 minutes of being idle. When the value is blank or set to **Not configured**, Intune doesn't change or update this setting.
  - **Maximum minutes after screen lock before password is required**: Enter the length of time devices must be inactive before a password is required to unlock it. When the value is blank or set to **Not configured**, Intune doesn't change or update this setting.
  - **Password expiration (days)**: Enter the number of days until the device password must be changed, from 1-65535. For example, enter `90` to expire the password after 90 days. When the password expires, users are prompted to create a new password. When the value is blank or set to **Not configured**, Intune doesn't change or update this setting.
  - **Prevent reuse of previous passwords**: Restrict users from creating previously used passwords. Enter the number of previously used passwords that can't be used, from 1-24. For example, enter 5 so users can't set a new password to their current password or any of their previous four passwords. When the value is blank, Intune doesn't change or update this setting.
  - **Maximum allowed sign-in attempts**: Enter the maximum number of times that users can consecutively try to sign in before the device locks users out, from 2-11. When this number is exceeded, the device is locked. We recommend not setting this value to a low number, such as `2` or `3`. It's common for users to enter the wrong password. We recommend setting to a higher value.

    For example, enter `5` so users can enter the wrong password up to five times. After the fifth attempt, the device is locked. If you leave this value blank, or don't change it, then `11` is used by default.    

    After six failed attempts, macOS automatically forces a time delay before a passcode can be entered again. The delay increases with each attempt. Set the **Lockout duration** to add a delay before the next passcode can be entered.

    - **Lockout duration**: Enter the number of minutes a lockout lasts, from 0-10000. During a device lockout, the sign in screen is inactive, and users can't sign in. When the lockout ends, user can try to sign in again.

      If you leave this value blank, or don't change it, then `30` minutes is used by default.

      This setting applies to:

      - macOS 10.10 and newer

- **Block user from modifying passcode**: **Yes** stops the passcode from being changed, added, or removed. When set to **Not configured** (default), Intune doesn't change or update this setting. By default, the OS might allow passcodes to be added, changed, or removed.

- **Block Touch ID to unlock device**: **Yes** prevents using fingerprints to unlock devices. When set to **Not configured** (default), Intune doesn't change or update this setting. By default, the OS might allow users to unlock the device using a fingerprint.

- **Block password AutoFill**: **Yes** prevents using the AutoFill Passwords feature on macOS. Choosing **Yes** also has the following impact:

  - Users aren't prompted to use a saved password in Safari or in any apps.
  - Automatic Strong Passwords are disabled, and strong passwords aren't suggested to users.

  When set to **Not configured** (default), Intune doesn't change or update this setting. By default, the OS might allow these features.

- **Block password proximity requests**: **Yes** prevents devices from requesting passwords from nearby devices. When set to **Not configured** (default), Intune doesn't change or update this setting. By default, the OS might allow these password requests.

- **Block password sharing**: **Yes** prevents sharing passwords between devices using AirDrop. When set to **Not configured** (default), Intune doesn't change or update this setting. By default, the OS might allow passwords to be shared.

## Privacy preferences

On macOS devices, apps and processes often prompt users to allow or deny access to device features, such as the camera, microphone, calendar, Documents folder, and more. These settings allow administrators to pre-approve or pre-deny access to these device features. When you configure these settings, you manage data access consent on behalf of your users. Your settings override their previous decisions.

The goal of these settings is to reduce the number of prompts by apps and processes.

This feature applies to:

- macOS 10.14 and newer
- Some settings apply to macOS 10.15 and newer.
- These settings only apply on devices that have the privacy preferences profile installed before being upgraded.

### Settings apply to: User approved device enrollment, Automated device enrollment
