# Add Wi-Fi settings for macOS devices in Microsoft Intune

You can create a profile with specific WiFi settings, and then deploy this profile to your macOS devices. Microsoft Intune offers many features, including authenticating to your network, adding a PKS or SCEP certificate, and more.

These Wi-Fi settings are separated in to two categories: Basic settings and Enterprise-level settings.

This article describes these settings.

## Before you begin

[Create a device profile](wi-fi-settings-configure.md).

> [!NOTE]
> These settings are available for all enrollment types. For more information on the enrollment types, see [macOS enrollment](../enrollment/macos-enroll.md).

## Basic profiles

- **Wi-Fi type**: Choose **Basic**.
- **Network name**: Enter a name for this Wi-Fi connection. This value is the name that users see when they browse the list of available connections on their device.
- **SSID**: Short for **service set identifier**. This property is the real name of the wireless network that devices connect to. However, users only see the network name you configured when they choose the connection.
- **Connect automatically**: Choose **Enable** to automatically connect to this network when the device is in range. Choose **Disable** to prevent devices from automatically connecting.
- **Hidden network**: Choose **Enable** to hide this network from the list of available networks on the device. The SSID isn't broadcasted. Choose **Disable** to show this network in the list of available networks on the device.
- **Security type**: Select the security protocol to authenticate to the Wi-Fi network. Your options:

  - **Open (no authentication)**: Only use this option if the network is unsecured.
  - **WPA/WPA2 - Personal**: Enter the password in **Pre-shared key**. When your organization's network is set up or configured, a password or network key is also configured. Enter this password or network key for the PSK value.
  - **WEP**

- **Proxy settings**: Your options:
  - **None**: No proxy settings are configured.
  - **Manual**: Enter the **Proxy server address** as an IP address, and its **Port number**.
  - **Automatic**: Use a file to configure the proxy server. Enter the **Proxy server URL** (for example `http://proxy.contoso.com`) that contains the configuration file.

## Enterprise profiles

- **Wi-Fi type**: Choose **Enterprise**.
- **SSID**: Short for **service set identifier**. This property is the real name of the wireless network that devices connect to. However, users only see the network name you configured when they choose the connection.
- **Connect automatically**: Choose **Enable** to automatically connect to this network when the device is in range. Choose **Disable** to prevent devices from automatically connecting.
- **Hidden network**: Choose **Enable** to hide this network from the list of available networks on the device. The SSID isn't broadcasted. Choose **Disable** to show this network in the list of available networks on the device.

- **EAP type**: Choose the Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) type used to authenticate secured wireless connections. Your options:

  - **EAP-FAST**: Enter the **Protected Access Credential (PAC) Settings**. This option uses protected access credentials to create an authenticated tunnel between the client and the authentication server. Your options:
    - **Do not use (PAC)**
    - **Use (PAC)**: If an existing PAC file exists, use it.
    - **Use and Provision PAC**: Create and add the PAC file to your devices.
    - **Use and Provision PAC Anonymously**: Create and add the PAC file to your devices without authenticating to the server.

  - **EAP-SIM**

  - **EAP-TLS**: Also enter:

    - **Server Trust** - **Certificate server names**: **Add** one or more common names used in the certificates issued by your trusted certificate authority (CA). When you enter this information, you can bypass the dynamic trust window displayed on user's devices when they connect to this Wi-Fi network.
    - **Root certificate for server validation**: Choose an existing trusted root certificate profile. This certificate is presented to the server when the client connects to the network, and is used to authenticate the connection.

    - **Client Authentication** - **Client certificate for client authentication (Identity certificate)**: Choose the SCEP or PKCS client certificate profile that is also deployed to the device. This certificate is the identity presented by the device to the server to authenticate the connection.

  - **EAP-TTLS**: Also enter:

    - **Server Trust** - **Certificate server names**: **Add** one or more common names used in the certificates issued by your trusted certificate authority (CA). When you enter this information, you can bypass the dynamic trust window displayed on user's devices when they connect to this Wi-Fi network.
    - **Root certificate for server validation**: Choose an existing trusted root certificate profile. This certificate is presented to the server when the client connects to the network, and is used to authenticate the connection.

    - **Client Authentication** - Choose an **Authentication method**. Your options:

      - **Username and Password**: Prompt the user for a user name and password to authenticate the connection. Also enter:
        - **Non-EAP method (inner identity)**: Choose how you authenticate the connection. Be sure you choose the same protocol that's configured on your Wi-Fi network.

          Your options: **Unencrypted password (PAP)**, **Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol (CHAP)**, **Microsoft CHAP (MS-CHAP)**, or **Microsoft CHAP Version 2 (MS-CHAP v2)**

      - **Certificates**: Choose the SCEP or PKCS client certificate profile that is also deployed to the device. This certificate is the identity presented by the device to the server to authenticate the connection.

      - **Identity privacy (outer identity)**: Enter the text sent in the response to an EAP identity request. This text can be any value, such as `anonymous`. During authentication, this anonymous identity is initially sent, and then followed by the real identification sent in a secure tunnel.

  - **LEAP**

  - **PEAP**: Also enter:

    - **Server Trust** - **Certificate server names**: **Add** one or more common names used in the certificates issued by your trusted certificate authority (CA). When you enter this information, you can bypass the dynamic trust window displayed on user's devices when they connect to this Wi-Fi network.
    - **Root certificate for server validation**: Choose an existing trusted root certificate profile. This certificate is presented to the server when the client connects to the network, and is used to authenticate the connection.

    - **Client Authentication** - Choose an **Authentication method**. Your options:

      - **Username and Password**: Prompt the user for a user name and password to authenticate the connection. 

      - **Certificates**: Choose the SCEP or PKCS client certificate profile that is also deployed to the device. This certificate is the identity presented by the device to the server to authenticate the connection.

      - **Identity privacy (outer identity)**: Enter the text sent in the response to an EAP identity request. This text can be any value, such as `anonymous`. During authentication, this anonymous identity is initially sent, and then followed by the real identification sent in a secure tunnel.

- **Proxy settings**: Your options:
  - **None**: No proxy settings are configured.
  - **Manual**: Enter the **Proxy server address** as an IP address, and its **Port number**.
  - **Automatic**: Use a file to configure the proxy server. Enter the **Proxy server URL** (for example `http://proxy.contoso.com`) that contains the configuration file.

## Next steps

The profile is created, but it's not doing anything. Next, [assign this profile](device-profile-assign.md) and [monitor its status](device-profile-monitor.md).

Configure Wi-Fi settings on [Android](wi-fi-settings-android.md), [Android Enterprise](wi-fi-settings-android-enterprise.md), [iOS/iPadOS](wi-fi-settings-ios.md), and [Windows 10](wi-fi-settings-windows.md) devices.
