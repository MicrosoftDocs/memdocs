# Configure the Take a Test app on Windows 10 devices using Intune

> [!NOTE]
> [!INCLUDE [not-all-settings-are-documented](../includes/not-all-settings-are-documented.md)]

The Take a Test app lets you securely administer online tests on your classroom's Windows 10 devices. To set up the Take a Test app, you'll need to create a device configuration profile in Intune and configure the secure assessment settings. This article describes some of the settings you'll find for the Take a Test app.

After you've configured the profile, assign and deploy it to your students. 

[Take a Test app in Intune](education-settings-configure.md) provides more information on this feature.

## Before you begin

Create a [Windows 10 secure assessment education device configuration profile](education-settings-configure.md#create-a-device-profile).

## Take a test settings

- **Account type**: Choose how users sign in to the test. Your options:
  - Azure AD account
  - Domain account
  - Local account
  - Local guest account: Only available on devices running Windows 10, version 1903 and later.
- **Account user name**: Enter the user name of the account used with the Take a Test app. You can enter accounts in the following format:
  - `user@contoso.com`
  - `domain\username`
  - `user@contoso.com`
  - `computerName\username`
- **Account name**: To set up a local guest account type, enter the name of the account used with the Take a Test app. The account name will appear as a tile on the sign-in screen. Students click the tile to launch the test.​  
- **Assessment URL**: Enter the URL of the test you want users to take. For more information on getting the URL, see the [Take a Test documentation](/education/windows/take-tests-in-windows-10).
- **Printer connection**: **Require** only allows access to the Take a Test app from devices that are connected to a printer. This setting also makes the app's print button available to test-takers. When set to **Not configured** (default), Intune doesn't change or update this setting. By default, the OS may allow students to access the app from devices that aren't connected to a printer.​  
- **Screen monitoring**: **Allow** monitors the screen activity while users are taking a test. When set to **Not configured** (default), Intune doesn't change or update this setting. By default, the OS may prevent you from monitoring the screen during the test.
- **Text suggestions**: Choose **Allow** so test takers can see text suggestions. When set to **Not configured** (default), Intune doesn't change or update this setting. By default, the OS may block text suggestions while users are taking a test.
