# Android Enterprise device settings to allow or restrict features using Intune

This article describes the different settings you can control on Android Enterprise devices. As part of your mobile device management (MDM) solution, use these settings to allow or disable features, run apps on dedicated devices, control security, and more.

This feature applies to:

- Android Enterprise personally owned devices with a work profile (BYOD)
- Android Enterprise corporate-owned work profile (COPE)
- Android Enterprise corporate owned fully managed (COBO)
- Android Enterprise corporate owned dedicated devices (COSU)

For Android device administrator, see [Android and Samsung Knox Standard device restrictions](device-restrictions-android.md).

## Before you begin

Create an [Android Enterprise device restrictions profile](device-restrictions-configure.md):

- Fully managed, dedicated, and corporate-owned work profile
- Personally owned devices with a work profile

## Fully Managed, Dedicated, and Corporate-Owned Work Profile

These settings apply to Android Enterprise enrollment types where Intune controls the entire device, such as Android Enterprise fully managed, dedicated, and corporate-owned work profile devices.

Some settings are not supported by all enrollment types. To see which settings are supported by which enrollment types, see the user interface. Each setting is under a heading that indicates the enrollment types that can use the setting.

:::image type="content" source="./media/device-restrictions-android-for-work/setting-headers.png" alt-text="See the Android Enterprise Users and Accounts setting headers and the enrollment types they apply to in Microsoft Intune and Endpoint Manager.":::

For corporate-owned devices with a work profile, some settings only apply in the work profile. These settings have **(work profile-level)** in the setting name. For fully managed and dedicated devices, these settings apply device-wide.

        >
        > - If a Wi-Fi network is password protected, then users must enter the password. After they enter the password, the configured network automatically connects. If they disconnect and then reconnect to the Wi-Fi network, then users may need to enter the password again.
        >
        > - On Android 11 devices, when users connect to a network using the Managed Home Screen, they're prompted to consent. This prompt comes from Android, and isn't specific to the Managed Home Screen.
        >
        > - On Android 10 devices, when users connect to a network using the Managed Home Screen, a notification prompts them to consent. So, users need access to the status bar and notifications to consent. To enable system notifications, see [General settings for dedicated devices](#dedicated-devices) (in this article).
        >
        > - On Android 10 devices, when users connect to a password protected Wi-Fi network using the Managed Home Screen, they're prompted for the password. If the device is connected to an unstable network, then the Wi-Fi network changes. This behavaior happens even when users enter the correct password.

      - **Bluetooth configuration**: **Enable** shows the Bluetooth control on the Managed Home Screen, and allows users to pair devices over Bluetooth.

For example, you can control sharing actions within applications, such as the **Share…** option in the Chrome browser app. This setting doesn't apply to copy/paste clipboard behavior. Your options:
  - **Device default**: The default sharing behavior of the device varies depending on the Android version:
    - On devices running Android 6.0 and newer, sharing from the personally owned work profile to the personal profile is blocked. Sharing from the personal profile to the personally owned work profile is allowed.
    - On devices running Android 6.0 and older, sharing between the personally owned work profile and the personal profile is blocked in both directions.
  - **Apps in work profile can handle sharing request from personal profile**: Enables the built-in Android feature that allows sharing from the personal to the personally owned work profile. When enabled, a sharing request from an app in the personal profile can share with apps in the personally owned work profile. This setting is the default behavior for Android devices running versions earlier than 6.0.
  - **No restrictions on sharing**: Enables sharing across the personally owned work profile boundary in both directions. When you select this setting, apps in the personally owned work profile can share data with unbadged apps in the personal profile. This setting allows managed apps in the personally owned work profile to share with apps on the unmanaged side of the device. So, use this setting carefully.

- **Work profile notifications while device locked**: **Block** prevents window notifications, including toasts, incoming calls, outgoing calls, system alerts, and system errors from showing on locked devices. When set to **Not configured** (default), Intune doesn't change or update this setting. By default, the OS might show notifications.

Starting with Android 6, users are prompted to grant certain permissions required by apps when the app is launched. This policy setting lets you decide if users are prompted to grant permissions for all apps in the personally owned work profile. For example, you assign an app to the personally owned work profile that requires location access. Normally that app prompts users to approve or deny location access to the app. Use this policy to automatically grant permissions without a prompt, automatically deny permissions without a prompt, or let users decide. Your options:
  - **Device default**
  - **Prompt**
  - **Auto grant**
  - **Auto deny**

  You can also use an app configuration policy to grant permissions for individual apps (**Apps** > **App configuration policies**).

- **Add and remove accounts**: **Block** prevents users from manually adding or removing accounts in the personally owned work profile. For example, when you deploy the Gmail app into an Android personally owned work profile, you can prevent users from adding or removing accounts in this personally owned work profile. When set to **Not configured** (default), Intune doesn't change or update this setting. By default, the OS might allow adding accounts in the personally owned work profile.  

  > [!NOTE]

When set to **Not configured** (default), Intune doesn't change or update this setting. By default, the OS might allow access to the camera.

- **Allow widgets from work profile apps**: **Enable** allows users to put widgets exposed by apps on the home screen. When set to **Not configured** (default), Intune doesn't change or update this setting. By default, the OS might disable this feature.

  For example, Outlook is installed on your users' personally owned work profiles. When set to **Enable**, users can put the agenda widget on the device home screen.

- **Require Work Profile Password**: **Require** forces a passcode policy that only applies to apps in the personally owned work profile. By default, users can use the two separately defined PINs. Or, users can combine the PINs into the stronger of the two PINs. When set to **Not configured** (default), Intune doesn't change or update this setting. By default, the OS might allow users to use work apps without entering a password.

  This setting applies to:

  - Android 7.0 and newer personally owned devices with a work profile

  Also configure:

  - **Minimum password length**: Enter the minimum length the password must have, between 4 and 16 characters.

  - **At least alphanumeric**: Includes uppercase letters, lowercase letters, and numeric characters.
  - **At least alphanumeric with symbols**: Includes uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numeric characters, punctuation marks, and symbols.

- **Prevent reuse of previous passwords**: Use this setting to restrict users from creating previously used passwords. Enter the number of previously used passwords that can't be used, from 1-24. For example, enter `5` so users can't set a new password to their current password or any of their previous four passwords. When the value is blank, Intune doesn't change or update this setting.
- **Fingerprint unlock**: **Block** prevents users from using the device's fingerprint scanner to unlock the device. When set to **Not configured** (default), Intune doesn't change or update this setting. By default, the OS might allow users to unlock the device using a fingerprint.
- **Face unlock**: **Block** prevents users from using the device's facial recognition to unlock the device. When set to **Not configured** (default), Intune doesn't change or update this setting. By default, the OS might allow users to unlock the device using facial recognition.
- **Iris unlock**: **Block** prevents users from using the device's iris scanner to unlock the device. When set to **Not configured** (default), Intune doesn't change or update this setting. By default, the OS might allow users to unlock the device using the iris scanner.
- **Smart Lock and other trust agents**: **Block** prevents Smart Lock or other trust agents from adjusting lock screen settings on compatible devices. If devices are in a trusted location, then this feature, also known as a trust agent, lets you disable or bypass the device lock screen password. For example, bypass the personally owned work profile password when devices are connected to a specific Bluetooth device, or when devices are close to an NFC tag. Use this setting to prevent users from configuring Smart Lock.

  When set to **Not configured** (default), Intune doesn't change or update this setting.

### System security

- **Threat scan on apps**: **Require** enforces that the **Verify Apps** setting is enabled for work and personal profiles. When set to **Not configured** (default), Intune doesn't change or update this setting.

  This setting applies to:

  - Android 8 (Oreo) and newer personally owned devices with a work profile

- **Prevent app installations from unknown sources in the personal profile**: By design, Android Enterprise personally owned devices with a work profile can't install apps from sources other than the Play Store. This setting allows administrators more control of app installations from unknown sources. **Block** prevents app installations from sources other than the Google Play Store in the personal profile. When set to **Not configured** (default), Intune doesn't change or update this setting. By default, the OS might allow app installations from unknown sources in the personal profile. By nature, personally owned devices with a work profile are intended to be dual-profile:

  - A personally owned devices with a work profile managed using MDM.
  - A personal profile that's isolated from MDM management.

### Connectivity

- **Always-on VPN**: **Enable** sets a VPN client to automatically connect and reconnect to the VPN. Always-on VPN connections stay connected. Or, immediately connect when users lock their device, the device restarts, or the wireless network changes.

  When set to **Not configured** (default), Intune doesn't change or update this setting. By default, the OS might disable always-on VPN for all VPN clients.

  > [!IMPORTANT]
  > Be sure to deploy only one Always On VPN policy to a single device. Deploying multiple Always VPN policies to a single device isn't supported.

- **VPN client**: Choose a VPN client that supports Always On. Your options:
  - Cisco AnyConnect
  - F5 Access
  - Palo Alto Networks GlobalProtect
  - Pulse Secure
  - Custom
    - **Package ID**: Enter the package ID of the app in the Google Play store. For example, if the URL for the app in the Play store is `https://play.google.com/store/details?id=com.contosovpn.android.prod`, then the package ID is `com.contosovpn.android.prod`.

  > [!IMPORTANT]
  >
  > - The VPN client you choose must be installed on the device. It must also support per-app VPN in personally owned devices with a work profile. Otherwise, an error occurs.
  > - You do need to approve the VPN client app in the **Managed Google Play Store**, sync the app to Intune, and deploy the app to the device. After you do this, then the app is installed in the user's personally owned devices with a work profile.
  > - There may be known issues when using per-app VPN with F5 Access for Android 3.0.4. For more information, see [F5's release notes for F5 Access for Android 3.0.4](https://support.f5.com/kb/en-us/products/big-ip_apm/releasenotes/related/relnote-f5access-android-3-0-4.html#relnotes_known_issues_f5_access_android).

- **Lockdown mode**: **Enable** forces all network traffic to use the VPN tunnel. If a connection to the VPN isn't established, then the device won't have network access.

  When set to **Not configured** (default), Intune doesn't change or update this setting. By default, the OS might allow traffic to flow through the VPN tunnel or through the mobile network.
