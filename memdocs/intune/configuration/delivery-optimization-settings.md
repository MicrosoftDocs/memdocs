# Delivery Optimization settings for Windows 10 devices in Intune

> [!NOTE]
> [!INCLUDE [not-all-settings-are-documented](../includes/not-all-settings-are-documented.md)]

This article lists some of the settings for Delivery Optimization that Intune supports for devices that run Windows 10 or later.  

Most options in the Intune console directly map to Delivery Optimization settings that are covered in-depth in the Windows documentation. These options include links to relevant content.  Settings or options that are specific to Intune don't contain links to additional content.  

The following tables include:  

- **Setting**: The setting as it appears in Intune. Settings that are links open the relevant entry in [Configure Delivery Optimization for Windows 10 updates](/windows/deployment/update/waas-delivery-optimization) in the Windows documentation where you can learn more about the setting.

- **Windows version**: The minimum version of Windows 10 that includes support for this setting.  

- **Details**: A brief description of how Intune implements the setting, including the Intune default. When available, there are links to [Delivery Optimization Policy configuration service provider](/windows/client-management/mdm/policy-csp-deliveryoptimization) (CSP) entries.  

To configure Intune to use these settings, see [Deliver updates](delivery-optimization-windows.md).  

## Before you begin

[Create a Windows 10 Delivery Optimization profile](delivery-optimization-windows.md).

## Delivery Optimization  

|Setting  |Windows version  |Details  |
|---------|-----------------|---------|
| [Download mode](/windows/deployment/update/waas-delivery-optimization-reference#download-mode)     | 1511         | Specify the download method that Delivery Optimization uses to download content.<br><ul><li>**Not configured**: End users update their devices using their own methods, which may be to use the *Windows Updates or Delivery Optimization* settings available with the operating system. </li> <li> **HTTP only, no peering (0)**: Get updates only from the internet. Don't get updates from other computers on your network (peer-to-peer). </li> <li> **HTTP blended with peering behind the same NAT (1)**: Get updates from the internet and from other computers on your network that are behind the same Network Address Translation (NAT) IP addresses. </li> <li> **HTTP blended with peering across a private group (2)**: Peering occurs on devices in the same Active Directory Site (if it exists) or the same domain. When this option is selected, peering crosses your NAT IP addresses. </li> <li> **HTTP blended with Internet peering (3)**: Get updates from the internet and from other computers on your network. </li> <li> **Simple download mode with no peering (99)**: Gets updates from the internet, directly from the update owner, such as Microsoft. It doesn't contact the Delivery Optimization cloud services. </li> <li> **Bypass mode (100)**: Use Background Intelligent Transfer Service (BITS) to get updates. Don't use Delivery Optimization. </li></ul> **Default**: Not configured  <br><br> Policy CSP: [DODownloadMode](/windows/client-management/mdm/policy-csp-deliveryoptimization#deliveryoptimization-dodownloadmode)  <br><br>  |

The percentage is of the available drive space, and Delivery Optimization constantly assesses the available drive space and will clear the cache to keep the maximum cache size under the set percentage. <br><br>Requires Windows 1511<br><br>Policy CSP: [DOMaxCacheSize](/windows/client-management/mdm/policy-csp-deliveryoptimization#deliveryoptimization-domaxcachesize)  |
| [VPN peer caching](/windows/deployment/update/waas-delivery-optimization-reference#enable-peer-caching-while-the-device-connects-via-vpn)  | 1709  | Select **Enabled** to configure a device to participate in Peer Caching while connected by VPN to the domain network. Devices that are enabled can download from or upload to other domain network devices, either on VPN or on the corporate domain network.  <br><br>**Default**: Not configured  <br><br>Policy CSP: [DOAllowVPNPeerCaching](/windows/client-management/mdm/policy-csp-deliveryoptimization#deliveryoptimization-domaxcacheage)    |

## Local Server Caching  

|Setting  |Windows version  |Details  |

When the [Bandwidth](#bandwidth) setting for *Delay background HTTP download (in seconds)* is configured, that setting applies first to allow downloads from peers. (0-2592000).   <br><br>**Default**: 0  <br><br>Policy CSP [DODelayCacheServerFallbackForeground](/windows/client-management/mdm/policy-csp-deliveryoptimization#deliveryoptimization-dodelaycacheserverfallbackforeground)  |
|[Delay background download Cache Server fallback (in seconds)](/windows/deployment/update/waas-delivery-optimization-reference#delay-background-download-cache-server-fallback-in-secs) | 1903    |Specify a time in seconds (0-2592000) to delay the fallback from a Cache server to the HTTP source for a background content download.

> [!NOTE]
> When you install a Microsoft Connected Cache on a Configuration Manager distribution point, cloud-managed devices can use the on-premises cache. As long as the device can communicate with the server, the cache is available to deliver content to these devices.
