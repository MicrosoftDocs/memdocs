# Device Firmware Configuration Interface (DFCI) profile settings in Microsoft Intune

This article lists and describes the DFCI profile settings you can control on Windows client devices. As part of your mobile device management (MDM) solution, use these settings to control security features, the built-in hardware, and the boot options in the UEFI layer on Windows.

These settings apply to:

- Windows 11 on supported UEFI
- Windows 10 RS5 (1809) and later on supported UEFI

These settings are added to a device configuration profile in Intune, and then assigned or deployed to your Windows client devices.

## Before you begin

- [Create the Windows DFCI profile](device-firmware-configuration-interface-windows.md). There are more requirements to creating DFCI profiles. For more specific information, go to [Use DFCI profiles on Windows devices in Microsoft Intune](device-firmware-configuration-interface-windows.md).
- Some settings aren't available for all devices. To confirm if a setting is or isn't available on your device, contact your device manufacturer.
- These settings use the [UEFI CSP](/windows/client-management/mdm/uefi-csp).

> [!WARNING]
> Be careful. Configuring and assigning DFCI profiles can lock the device beyond repair. The DFCI profile settings change the device hardware, and can't be fixed by re-imaging the OS.

## UEFI access

- **Allow local user to change UEFI settings**: Your options:
  - **Only not configured settings**: The local user can change any setting *except* those settings explicitly set to **Enable** or **Disable** by Intune.
  - **None**: The local user can't change any UEFI (BIOS) settings, including settings not shown in the DFCI profile.

## Security features

- **CPU and IO virtualization**: Your options:
  - **Not configured**: Intune doesn't change or update this setting.
  - **Enabled**: The BIOS enables the platform's CPU and IO virtualization capabilities for use by the OS. It turns on Windows Virtualization Based Security and Device Guard technologies.

- **Windows Platform Binary Table** (WPBT): The WPBT allows vendors and OEMs to run an `.exe` program in the UEFI layer. Every time Windows boots, it looks at the UEFI, and runs the `.exe`. Use this feature to run programs that aren't included with the Windows media.

  Your options:
  - **Not configured**: Intune doesn't change or update this setting. By default, the OS might allow vendors and OEMs to run programs using the WPBT.
  - **Enabled**: Enables the WPBT and allows `.exe` programs in the UEFI layer to run.
  - **Disabled**: Disables the WPBT and prevents `.exe` programs in the UEFI layer from running.

- **Simultaneous multithreading** (SMT): Also known as hyper-threading. Your options:
  - **Not configured**: Intune doesn't change or update this setting.
  - **Enabled**: Enables SMT in the UEFI layer.
  - **Disabled**: Disables SMT in the UEFI layer.

## Cameras

- **Cameras**: This setting manages all the hardware cameras built into the device. It doesn't manage attached peripherals, such as USB webcams.

  Your options:

  - **Not configured**: Intune doesn't change or update this setting. By default, the OS might enable the built-in cameras.
  - **Enabled**: All built-in cameras directly managed by UEFI (BIOS) are enabled. Peripherals, like USB cameras, aren't affected.
  - **Disabled**: All built-in cameras directly managed by UEFI (BIOS) are disabled. Peripherals, like USB cameras, aren't affected.

- **Front cameras**: This setting manages the built-in front visible light cameras managed by UEFI (BIOS). It doesn't manage attached peripherals.

  Your options:

## Boot Options

> [!WARNING]
> Disabling all external boot options or all external ports significantly complicates OS recovery. To recover a device that can no longer boot Windows, you might have to physically open the device and replace the hardware storage.

- **Boot from external media (USB, SD)**: Your options:
  - **Not configured**: Intune doesn't change or update this setting. By default, the OS might allow booting from external media.
  - **Enabled**: UEFI (BIOS) allows booting from non-hard drive storage.
  - **Disabled**: UEFI (BIOS) prevents booting from non-hard drive storage, which also disables booting from network adapters.

    When set to **Disabled**, don't set the **Boot from network adapters** setting to **Enabled**. It causes the **Boot from external media (USB, SD)** setting or **Boot from network adapters** setting to become not compliant.

- **Boot from network adapters**: Your options:
  - **Not configured**: Intune doesn't change or update this setting. By default, the OS might allow booting from built-in network adapters.
  - **Enabled**: UEFI (BIOS) allows booting from built-in network interfaces.
  - **Disabled**: UEFI (BIOS) prevents booting built-in network interfaces.

## Ports

> [!WARNING]
> Disabling all external boot options or all external ports significantly complicates OS recovery. To recover a device that can no longer boot Windows, you might have to physically open the device and replace the hardware storage.

  - **Disabled**: All built-in SD card ports directly managed by UEFI (BIOS) are disabled. Peripherals, like USB devices, aren't affected.

## Wake settings

- **Wake on LAN**: Wake on LAN allows a network administrator to remotely wake a device in sleep mode using the LAN.

  Your options:

  - **Not configured**: Intune doesn't change or update this setting. By default, the OS might prevent waking a device using the LAN.
  - **Enabled**: UEFI (BIOS) allows waking a device using the LAN.
