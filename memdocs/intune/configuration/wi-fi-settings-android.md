# Add Wi-Fi settings for devices running Android in Microsoft Intune

You can create a profile with specific WiFi settings, and then deploy this profile to your Android devices. Microsoft Intune offers many features, including authenticating to your network, adding a PKS or SCEP certificate, and more.

These Wi-Fi settings are separated in to two categories: Basic settings and Enterprise-level settings.

This article describes these settings.

## Before you begin

[Create a device profile](wi-fi-settings-configure.md).

## Basic

- **Wi-Fi type**: Choose **Basic**.
- **SSID**: Enter the **service set identifier**, which is the real name of the wireless network that devices connect to. However, users only see the **network name** you configured when they choose the connection.
- **Hidden network**: Choose **Enable** to hide this network from the list of available networks on the device. The SSID isn't broadcasted. Choose **Disable** to show this network in the list of available networks on the device.

## Enterprise

- **Wi-Fi type**: Choose **Enterprise**.
- **SSID**: Enter the **service set identifier**, which is the real name of the wireless network that devices connect to. However, users only see the **network name** you configured when they choose the connection.
- **Hidden network**: Choose **Enable** to hide this network from the list of available networks on the device. The SSID isn't broadcasted. Choose **Disable** to show this network in the list of available networks on the device.
- **EAP type**: Choose the Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) type used to authenticate secured wireless connections. Your options:

  - **EAP-TLS**: Also enter:

    - **Server Trust** - **Root certificate for server validation**: Choose an existing trusted root certificate profile. This certificate is presented to the server when the client connects to the network. It authenticates the connection.

    - **Client Authentication** - **Client certificate for client authentication (Identity certificate)**: Choose the SCEP or PKCS client certificate profile that is also deployed to the device. This certificate is the identity presented by the device to the server to authenticate the connection.

    - **Identity privacy (outer identity)**: Enter the text sent in the response to an EAP identity request. This text can be any value, such as `anonymous`. During authentication, this anonymous identity is initially sent, and then followed by the real identification sent in a secure tunnel.â€‹

  - **EAP-TTLS**: Also enter:

    - **Server Trust** - **Root certificate for server validation**: Choose an existing trusted root certificate profile. This certificate is presented to the server when the client connects to the network. It authenticates the connection.

    - **Client Authentication**: Choose an **Authentication method**. Your options:

      - **Username and Password**: Prompt the user for a user name and password to authenticate the connection. Also enter:
        - **Non-EAP method (inner identity)**: Choose how you authenticate the connection. Be sure you choose the same protocol that's configured on your Wi-Fi network. Your options:

          - **Unencrypted password (PAP)**
          - **Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol (CHAP)**
          - **Microsoft CHAP (MS-CHAP)**
          - **Microsoft CHAP Version 2 (MS-CHAP v2)**

      - **Certificates**: Choose the SCEP or PKCS client certificate profile that is also deployed to the device. This certificate is the identity presented by the device to the server to authenticate the connection.

      - **Identity privacy (outer identity)**: Enter the text sent in the response to an EAP identity request. This text can be any value, such as `anonymous`. During authentication, this anonymous identity is initially sent, and then followed by the real identification sent in a secure tunnel.

  - **PEAP**: Also enter:

    - **Server Trust** - **Root certificate for server validation**: Choose an existing trusted root certificate profile. This certificate is presented to the server when the client connects to the network. It authenticates the connection.

    - **Client Authentication**: Choose an **Authentication method**. Your options:

      - **Username and Password**: Prompt the user for a user name and password to authenticate the connection. Also enter:
        - **Non-EAP method for authentication (inner identity)**: Choose how you authenticate the connection. Be sure you choose the same protocol that's configured on your Wi-Fi network. Your options:

          - **None**
          - **Microsoft CHAP Version 2 (MS-CHAP v2)**

      - **Certificates**: Choose the SCEP or PKCS client certificate profile that is also deployed to the device. This certificate is the identity presented by the device to the server to authenticate the connection.

      - **Identity privacy (outer identity)**: Enter the text sent in the response to an EAP identity request. This text can be any value, such as `anonymous`. During authentication, this anonymous identity is initially sent, and then followed by the real identification sent in a secure tunnel.

## Next steps

The profile is created, but it's not doing anything. Next, [assign this profile](device-profile-assign.md).
