# Use custom settings for Windows Phone 8.1 devices in Intune

Using Microsoft Intune, you can add or create custom settings for your Windows Phone 8.1 devices using "custom profiles". Custom profiles are a feature in Intune. They're designed to add device settings and features that aren't built in to Intune.

Windows Phone 8.1 custom profiles use Open Mobile Alliance Uniform Resource Identifier (OMA-URI) settings to configure different features. These settings are typically used by mobile device manufacturers to control features on the device. [Windows Phone 8.1 MDM protocol documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-phone/dn499787(v=technet.10)) lists the settings.

This article shows you how to create a custom profile for Windows Phone 8.1 devices. 

## Create the profile

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431).
2. Select **Devices** > **Configuration profiles** > **Create profile**.
3. Enter the following settings:

    - **Name**: Enter a descriptive name for the profile. Name your profiles so you can easily identify them later. For example, a good profile name is **Windows phone custom profile**.
    - **Description**: Enter a description that gives an overview of the setting, and any other important details.
    - **Platform**: Select **Windows Phone 8.1**.
    - **Profile type**: Select **Custom**.

4. In **Custom OMA-URI Settings**, select **Add**. Enter the following settings:

    - **Name**: Enter a unique name for the OMA-URI setting to help you identify it in the list of settings.
    - **Description**: Enter a description that gives an overview of the setting, and any other relevant information to help you locate the profile.
    - **OMA-URI** (case sensitive): Enter the OMA-URI you want to use as a setting.
    - **Data type**: Select the data type you'll use for this OMA-URI setting. Your options:

        - String
        - String (XML file)
        - Date and time
        - Integer
        - Floating point
        - Boolean
        - Base64 (file)

    - **Value**: Enter the data value you want to associate with the OMA-URI you entered. The value depends on the data type you selected. For example, if you select **Date and time**, select the value from a date picker.

    After you add some settings, you can select **Export**. **Export** creates a list of all the values you added in a comma-separated values (.csv) file.

5. Select **OK** to save your changes. Continue to add more settings as needed.
6. When finished, select **OK** > **Create** to create the Intune profile. When complete, your profile is shown in the **Devices - Configuration profiles** list.

## Example

In the following example, Windows 8.1 phone devices are prevented from changing cellular networks when traveling outside the carrier coverage area.

- **Name**: Allow Cellular Data Roaming
- **Description**: Allow or disallow cellular data roaming
- **OMA-URI** (case sensitive): ./Vendor/MSFT/PolicyManager/My/Connectivity/AllowCellularDataRoaming
- **Data type**: Integer
- **Value**: 0

## Next steps

The profile is created, but it's not doing anything yet. Next, [assign the profile](device-profile-assign.md) and [monitor its status](device-profile-monitor.md).

Create a [custom profile on Windows 10 devices](custom-settings-windows-10.md).
