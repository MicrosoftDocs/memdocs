These settings can create, use, and control custom settings and features on iOS/iPadOS devices. This custom profile can then be assigned or distributed to iOS/iPadOS devices in your organization to create a baseline or standard.

# Use custom settings for iOS and iPadOS devices in Microsoft Intune

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Custom configuration profiles shouldn't be used for sensitive information, such as WiFi connections or authenticating apps, sites, and more. Instead, use the built-in profiles for sensitive information, as they're designed and configured to handle sensitive information.
> 
> For example, use the built-in [Wi-Fi profile](wi-fi-settings-configure.md) to deploy a Wi-Fi connection. Use the built-in [certificates profile](../protect/certificates-configure.md) for authentication.

Using Microsoft Intune, you can add or create custom settings for your iOS/iPadOS devices using "custom profiles". Custom profiles are a feature in Intune. They're designed to add device settings and features that aren't built in to Intune.

When using iOS/iPadOS devices, there are two ways to get custom settings into Intune:

- [Apple Configurator](https://itunes.apple.com/app/apple-configurator-2/id1037126344?mt=12)
- [Apple Profile Manager](https://support.apple.com/profile-manager)

You can use these tools to export settings to a configuration profile. In Intune, you import this file, and then assign the profile to your iOS/iPadOS users and devices. Once assigned, the settings are distributed. They also create a baseline or standard for iOS/iPadOS in your organization.

This article provides some guidance on using Apple Configurator and Apple Profile Manager, and describes the properties you can configure.

## Before you begin

Create an [iOS/iPadOS custom device configuration profile](custom-settings-configure.md).

## What you need to know

- When using **Apple Configurator** to create the configuration profile, be sure the settings you export are compatible with the iOS/iPadOS version on the devices. For information on resolving incompatible settings, search for **Configuration Profile Reference** and **Mobile Device Management Protocol Reference** on the [Apple Developer](https://developer.apple.com/) website.

- When using **Apple Profile Manager**, be sure to:

  - Enable [mobile device management](https://help.apple.com/serverapp/mac/5.7/#/apd05B9B761-D390-4A75-9251-E9AD29A61D0C) in Profile Manager.
  - Add [iOS/iPadOS devices](https://help.apple.com/profilemanager/mac/5.7/#/pm9onzap1984) in Profile Manager.
  - After you add a device in Profile Manager, go to **Under the Library** > **Devices** > select your device > **Settings**. Enter the general settings for the device.

    Download and save this file. You'll enter this file in the Intune profile.

  - Be sure the settings you export from the Apple Profile Manager are compatible with the iOS/iPadOS version on the devices. For information on resolving incompatible settings, search for **Configuration Profile Reference** and **Mobile Device Management Protocol Reference** on the [Apple Developer](https://developer.apple.com/) website.

## Custom configuration profile settings

- **Custom configuration profile name**: Enter a name for the policy. This name is shown on the device, and in the Intune status.
- **Configuration profile file**: Browse to the configuration profile you created using the Apple Configurator or Apple Profile Manager. The max file size is `1000000` bytes (just under 1MB). The file you imported is shown in the **File contents** area.

  You can also add device tokens to your custom configuration files. Device tokens are used to add device-specific information. For example, to show the serial number, enter `{{serialnumber}}`. On the device, the text shows similar to `123456789ABC`, which is unique to each device. When entering variables, be sure to use curly brackets `{{ }}`. [App configuration tokens](../apps/app-configuration-policies-use-ios.md#tokens-used-in-the-property-list) includes a list of variables that can be used. You can also use `deviceid` or any other device-specific value.

  > [!NOTE]
  > Variables aren't validated in the UI, and are case sensitive. As a result, you may see profiles saved with incorrect input. For example, if you enter `{{DeviceID}}` instead of `{{deviceid}}`, then the literal string is shown instead of the device's unique ID. Be sure to enter the correct information.

## Next steps

The profile is created, but it's not doing anything yet. Next, [assign the profile](device-profile-assign.md).

See how to [create the profile on macOS devices](custom-settings-macos.md).
