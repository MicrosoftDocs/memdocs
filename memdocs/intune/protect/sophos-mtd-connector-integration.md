# Integrate Sophos Mobile with Intune  

Complete the following steps to integrate the Sophos Mobile Threat Defense solution with Intune.  

> [!NOTE]
> This Mobile Threat Defense vendor is not supported for unenrolled devices.

## Before you begin  

Before starting the process of integrating Sophos Mobile with Intune, make sure you have the following:  
- Microsoft Intune subscription  
- Azure Active Directory admin credentials to grant the following permissions:  
  - Sign in and read user profile  
  - Access the directory as the signed-in user  
  - Read directory data  
  - Send device information to Intune  
- Admin credentials to access the Sophos Mobile admin console.  


### Sophos Mobile app authorization  
  
The Sophos Mobile app authorization process follows:  
- Allow the Sophos Mobile service to communicate information related to device health state back to Intune.  
- Sophos Mobile syncs with Azure AD Enrollment Group membership to populate its device's database.  
- Allow the Sophos Mobile admin console to use Azure AD Single Sign On (SSO).  
- Allow the Sophos Mobile app to sign in using Azure AD SSO.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center portal](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431), go to **Tenant administration** > **Connectors and tokens** > **Mobile Threat Defense** > and select **Add**.
