# Optional diagnostic data from Intune Client apps

Intune collects various optional data to detect, diagnose, and fix problems from users through various Intune client apps.  These optional diagnostic data we collect help to proactively detect problems in your organization so they can be addressed before they become an issue. Intune client apps include:

- iOS/iPadOS Company Portal
- macOS Company Portal
- Windows Company Portal
- Android Company Portal
- Android Intune app
- Microsoft Intune Management Agent for macOS
- Microsoft Intune Management Extension
- Android Mobile App Management (MAM)

The optional data collected from clients aren't required to successful run Intune services. The data collected helps:

- Provides enhanced information to help us proactively detect, diagnose, and fix issues.
- Makes product and service improvements.

## Data not collected

The data do not include any customer information, like:

## Turn off data collection

We think there are compelling reasons for people to share this optional data. All optional diagnostic data Microsoft collects during the use of any Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise applications and services is pseudonymized as defined in the ISO/IEC 19944-1:2020 (section 8.3.3) standard.

Users can [turn off usage data collection](../user-help/turn-off-microsoft-usage-data-collection-android.md) for their individual devices.
