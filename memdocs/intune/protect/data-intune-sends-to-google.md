# Data Intune sends to Google

When Android enterprise device management is enabled on a device, Microsoft Intune establishes a connection with Google and shares user and device information with Google. Before Microsoft Intune can establish a connection, you must create a Google account.

The following table lists the data that Microsoft Intune sends to Google when device management is enabled on a device:
