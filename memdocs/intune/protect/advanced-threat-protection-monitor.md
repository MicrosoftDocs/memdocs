# Monitor device status when you integrate Microsoft Defender for Endpoint with Intune

When you integrate Microsoft Intune and Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, you can view information about device compliance and onboarding in the Microsoft Intune admin center.

## Monitor device compliance

Monitor the state of devices that have the Microsoft Defender for Endpoint compliance policy.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431).

2. Select **Devices** > **Compliance**. On the **Monitor** tab, select **Noncompliant devices**.  

3. Find your Microsoft Defender for Endpoint policy in the list, and see which devices are compliant or noncompliant.

For more information about reports, see [Intune reports](../fundamentals/reports.md).

## View onboarding status

To view the onboarding status of your Intune-managed devices, go to **Endpoint security** > **Microsoft Defender for Endpoint**. At the bottom of this page is a visualization report for **Devices onboarded onto Microsoft Defender for Endpoint**, which displays the count of devices that report status from the Defender for Endpoint sensor.
