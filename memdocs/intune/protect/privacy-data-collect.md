# Data collection in Intune

When users enroll their corporate or personal devices using Intune, Intune collects and shares some personal data. Intune collects personal data from the following sources:

- The admin's use of the Intune in the Azure portal.
- End-user devices (when they enroll for Intune management and during usage).
- Customer accounts at third party services (per the admin's instructions).
- Diagnostic, performance, and usage information.

From these sources, Intune collects information that falls into the following three categories: [identified](#identified-data), [pseudonymized](#pseudonymized-data), and [aggregated](#aggregated-data).

> [!NOTE]
> We do not sell any data collected by our service to any third parties for any reason.

## Identified data

Most personal data collected by Intune is identified data. This data is tied to a user, device, or application and is essential to the nature of management. Identified data is used to manage a user's device and applications, and to provision the Intune service.

Identified data collected by Intune may include, but is not limited to: 

- User information
  - Owner name/user display (the Azure-registered name of the user as identified by theAzureUserID)
  - User Principal Name or email address
  - Third-party user identifies (like AppleID)
- Hardware inventory information
  - Device name
  - Manufacturer
  - Operating system
  - Serial number
  - IMEI number
  - IP address
  - Wi-Fi MacAddress
  - ICCID
  - Phone number
- Audit log information, including data about the following activities
  - Manage
  - Create
  - Update (edit)
  - Delete
  - Assign
  - Remote tasks
- Support information
  - Contact information (name, phone number, email address)
  - Email discussions with Microsoft support, product, and/or customer experience team members
- Access control information (Intune uses this data to manage access to administrative roles and functions through features like [Role Based Access Control](../fundamentals/role-based-access-control.md).
  - Static authenticators (customer's password)
  - Privacy keys for certificates 
- Admin and account information
  - Admin user first name and last name
  - Admin user name
  - UPN (email)
  - Phone number
  - Email address of account owner
  - Active Directory ID of each customer IT admin
  - Payment data for customer billing
  - Subscription key
- Application inventory, like
  - app name
  - version
  - app ID
  - size
  - installation location
  - Application inventory data is only collected when marked by the Admin as a corporate-owned device or the compliant app feature is turned on.  
- Customer 3rd party tenant IDs, like the Apple ID. 

## Pseudonymized data

Pseudonymized data is associated with a unique identifier, typically a number generated by the system that cannot on its own identify an individual person but is used to deliver the enterprise services to users. 

Pseudonymized data collected by Intune may include, but is not limited to: 

- Diagnostic, performance, and usage data tied to a user and/or device
  - The number of times a feature is used
  - The commands provided to the feature
  - A service's response time
  - Success rates of installations and other processes
  - Intune company portal application errors
  - User and device identifiers
  - Identifiers for reference, correlation, management purposes 
- Device data not tied to a device or user (if this data is tied to a device or user, Intune treats it as identified data)
  - Intune device ID
  - Azure Active Directory device ID
  - Intune device management ID
  - Tenant ID
  - Account ID
  - EAS device ID
  - Platform-specific IDs
  - AppleID for iOS/iPadOS devices
  - Mac Address for Mac devices
  - Windows ID for Windows devices
- Managed application information
  - Managed application ID
  - Managed application device tag
  - Intune device management ID
  - Azure Active Directory device ID
  - Encryption keys

## Aggregated data

Aggregated data is used to provision and improve the Intune service. 

Aggregated data collected by Intune may include, but is not limited to: 

- Admin usage data from across all Intune tenants (for example, admin controls selected when interacting with the Admin console)
- Tenant account information (this data is available from the Intune blade)
  - Number of devices or users enrolled
  - Number of identified device platforms  
  - Number of installed devices
  - installedDeviceCount: The number of devices on which the application is installed.
  - notApplicableDeviceCount: The number of devices for which the application is not applicable.
  - notInstalledDeviceCount: The number of devices for which the application is applicable but not installed.
  - pendingInstallDeviceCount: The number of devices for which the application is applicable and installation is pending.
