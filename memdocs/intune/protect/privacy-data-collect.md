# Data collection in Intune

When users enroll their corporate or personal devices with Intune, Intune collects, processes, and shares some personal data to support business operations, conduct business with the customer and to support the service. Intune collects personal data from the following sources:

- The administrators use of the Intune in the Microsoft Intune admin center.
- End-user devices (when devices are enrolled for Intune management and during usage).
- Customer accounts at third party services (per admin's instructions).
- Diagnostic, performance, and usage information.

From these sources, Intune collects information that falls into the following two categories: [required](#required-data), [optional](#optional-data). Each category is divided into customer data, personal data, diagnostic data, and service-generated data.

> [!NOTE]
> We do not sell any data collected by our service to any third parties for any reason.

## Required data

Data in the required category consists of data in the default feature set that is necessary to make our service work as expected by the customer. Most of the data collected by Intune is required data. This data is tied to a user, device, or application and is essential to the nature of management. The data collected contains both personal data and non-personal data. Personal data includes identifiable data that may directly identify the end user, or pseudonymized data with a unique identifier generated by the system that's used to deliver the enterprise service to users, support data, and account data. Non-personal data includes service-generated system metadata and organizational/tenant information. Intune also collects access control data to manage access to administrative roles and functions through features like [Role Based Access Control](../fundamentals/role-based-access-control.md).

Required data collected by Intune may include, but isn't limited to:

<sup>**1**</sup> Intune Mobile Application Management (MAM) can be deployed independent of other Intune workloads. For customers only using Intune MAM, this column identifies which required data is collected.

## Optional data

Data in the required category consists of data in the default feature set that is necessary to make our service work as expected by the customer.

Your organization may enable optional features within Intune which enable collection of additional information from devices:

- Device query for Corporate-owned Windows Devices

  When a customer enables Device query, the admin can query device details such as File Name and File Path. For a complete list of data, see [Intune data platform schema](../../analytics/data-platform-schema.md).

Customers can control the collection of pseudonymized diagnostics and telemetry data from Intune components installed on their devices.  We think there are compelling reasons for people to share this optional data as it helps Microsoft improve the reliability and performance of its products and we understand the importance of providing users the opportunity to make these choices for themselves.

Examples of the optional data fall into the following categories as defined by the [ISO/IEC 19944-1:2020 Information technology - Cloud computing - Cloud services and devices: Data flow, data categories](https://www.iso.org/standard/79573.html):

- Details about the device, its configuration and connectivity capabilities, and status.
- Details about the usage of the device, operating system, applications, and services.
- Details about the health of the device, operating system, apps, and drivers.
- Software installation and update information on the device.

## Certain End User Data or Content is never Collected

Intune doesn't collect nor allow an Admin to see the following data:

- An end users' calling or web browsing history
- Personal email
- Text messages
- Contacts
- Passwords to personal accounts
- Calendar events
- Photos, including those in a photo app or camera

For more information, see [Getting started enrolling devices](../fundamentals/deployment-guide-enrollment.md).
