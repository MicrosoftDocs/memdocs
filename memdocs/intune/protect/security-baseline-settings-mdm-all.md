# Windows MDM security baseline settings for Intune

View the MDM security baseline settings that Microsoft Intune supports for devices that run Windows 10 or later. The default values for settings in this baseline represent the recommended configuration for applicable devices. Defaults for one baseline might not match defaults from other security baselines, or from other versions of this baseline.

- To learn about using security baselines with Intune and how to upgrade the baseline version in your security baseline profiles, see [Use security baselines](security-baselines.md).
- The most recent baseline version is **MDM Security Baseline for December 2020**


::: zone pivot="mdm-december-2020"

::: zone pivot="mdm-may-2019,mdm-sept-2020,mdm-december-2020"

This version of the security baseline replaces previous versions. Profiles that were created prior to the availability of this baseline version:

- Are now read-only. You can continue to use those profiles, but can't edit them to change their configuration.
- Can be updated to the latest version. After you update to the current baseline version, you can edit the profile to modify settings.

To understand what's changed with this version of the baseline from previous versions, use the [Compare baselines](../protect/security-baselines.md#compare-baseline-versions) action that's available when viewing the *Versions* pane for this baseline. Be sure to select the version of the baseline that you want to view.

To update a security baseline profile to the latest version of that baseline, see [Change the baseline version for a profile](../protect/security-baselines-configure.md#change-the-baseline-version-for-a-profile).

**Preview - MDM Security Baseline for October 2018**:  
> [!NOTE]
> This is the preview version of the MDM security baseline, released in October of 2018. This preview baseline was replaced in June of 2019 by the release of the *MDM Security Baseline for May 2019* template, which is generally available (not in preview). Profiles that were created prior to the availability of the *MDM Security Baseline for May 2019* baseline won't update to reflect the settings and values that are in the MDM Security Baseline for May 2019 version. Although you can't create new profiles based on the preview template, you can edit and continue to use profiles you previously created that are based on the preview template.

To update a security baseline profile to the latest version of that baseline, see [Change the baseline version for a profile](../protect/security-baselines-configure.md#change-the-baseline-version-for-a-profile).

  **Default**: Yes

- **Block MSI app installations with elevated privileges**:  
  This policy setting directs Windows Installer to use elevated permissions when it installs any program on the system.

  - *If you enable this policy setting*, privileges are extended to all programs. Typically, these privileges are reserved for programs that are assigned to the user (offered on the desktop), assigned to the computer (installed automatically), or are available in Add or Remove Programs in Control Panel. This profile setting lets users install programs that require access to directories that the user might not have permission to view or change, including directories on highly restricted computers.

  - *If you disable or don't configure this policy setting*, the system applies the current user's permissions when it installs programs that a system administrator doesn't distribute or offer. Note: This policy setting appears both in the Computer Configuration and User Configuration folders. To make this policy setting effective, you must enable it in both folders. Caution: Skilled users can take advantage of the permissions this policy setting grants to change their privileges and gain permanent access to restricted files and folders. The User Configuration version of this policy setting isn't guaranteed to be secure.

## Audit

- **Account Logon Audit Credential Validation (Device)**:  
  This policy setting allows you to audit events generated by validation tests on user account logon credentials. Events in this subcategory occur only on the computer that is authoritative for those credentials. For domain accounts, the domain controller is authoritative. For local accounts, the local computer is authoritative.

  **Default**: Success and Failure

- **Account Logon Audit Kerberos Authentication Service (Device)**:  
  This policy setting allows you to audit events generated by Kerberos authentication ticket-granting ticket (TGT) requests. If you configure this policy setting, an audit event is generated after a Kerberos authentication TGT request. Success audits record successful requests and Failure audits record unsuccessful requests. If you don't configure this policy setting, no audit event is generated after a Kerberos authentication TGT request.

  **Default**: None

- **Account Logon Logoff Audit Account Lockout (Device)**:  

  **Default**: Failure

- **Account Logon Logoff Audit Group Membership (Device)**:  
  This policy allows you to audit the group membership information in the user's logon token. Events in this subcategory are generated on the computer on which a logon session is created. For an interactive logon, the security audit event is generated on the computer that the user logged on to. For a network logon, such as accessing a shared folder on the network, the security audit event is generated on the computer hosting the resource. When this setting is configured, one or more security audit events are generated for each successful logon. You must also enable the Audit Logon setting under Advanced Audit Policy Configuration\System Audit Policies\Logon/Logoff. Multiple events are generated if the group membership information can't fit in a single security audit event.

  **Default**: Success

- **Account Logon Logoff Audit Logon (Device)**:  
  This policy setting allows you to audit events generated by user account logon attempts on the computer. Events in this subcategory are related to the creation of logon sessions and occur on the computer that was accessed. For an interactive logon, the security audit event is generated on the computer that the user account logged on to. For a network logon, such as accessing a shared folder on the network, the security audit event is generated on the computer hosting the resource. The following events are included: Successful logon attempts. Failed logon attempts. Logon attempts using explicit credentials. This event is generated when a process attempts to log on an account by explicitly specifying that accounts credentials. This most commonly occurs in batch logon configurations, such as scheduled tasks or when using the RUNAS command. Security identifiers (SIDs) were filtered and not allowed to log on.

  **Default**: Success and Failure

- **Audit Other Logon Logoff Events (Device)**:  
  This policy setting allows you to audit other events related to logon/logoff, that aren't covered in the *Logon/Logoff* policy setting such as the following: Terminal Services session disconnections. New Terminal Services sessions. Locking and unlocking a workstation. Invoking a screen saver. Dismissal of a screen saver. Detection of a Kerberos replay attack, in which a Kerberos request was received twice with identical information. This condition could be caused by network misconfiguration. Access to a wireless network granted to a user or computer account. Access to a wired 802.1x network granted to a user or computer account.

  **Default**: Success and Failure

- **Audit Special Logon (Device)**:  
  This policy setting allows you to audit events generated by special logons such as the following: The use of a special logon, which is a logon that has administrator-equivalent privileges and can be used to elevate a process to a higher level. A logon by a member of a Special Group. Special Groups enable you to audit events generated when a member of a certain group has logged on to your network. You can configure a list of group security identifiers (SIDs) in the registry. If any of those SIDs are added to a token during logon and the subcategory is enabled, an event is logged. For more information about this feature, see article 947223 in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=121697).

For more information, see [Policy CSP - Autoplay](/windows/client-management/mdm/policy-csp-autoplay) in the Windows documentation.

- **Auto play default auto run behavior**:  
  This setting affects the default behavior for Autorun commands. Autorun commands are stored in autorun.inf files and can launch installation programs or other routines. When *Enabled*, Administrators can change the default autorun behavior on a device that runs Windows Vista or later. Behavior can be set to: a) completely disable autorun commands, or b) revert back to pre-Windows Vista behavior of automatically executing the autorun command. When set to *Disabled* or *Not Configured*, devices that run Windows Vista or later prompt the user as to whether an autorun command should run.  
  [Learn more](/windows/client-management/mdm/policy-csp-autoplay#autoplay-setdefaultautorunbehavior)

  **Default**: Do not execute

- **Auto play mode**:  
  This policy setting allows you to turn off the Autoplay feature. Autoplay begins reading from a drive as soon as you insert media in the drive. As a result, the setup file of programs and the music on audio media start immediately. With Windows XP SP2 and earlier, Autoplay is disabled by default on removable drives, such as the floppy disk drive (but not the CD-ROM drive), and on network drives. Starting with Windows XP SP2, Autoplay is enabled for removable drives as well, including Zip drives and some USB mass storage devices. If you enable this policy setting, Autoplay is disabled on CD-ROM and removable media drives, or disabled on all drives. This policy setting disables Autoplay on additional types of drives. You can't use this setting to enable Autoplay on drives on which it's disabled by default. If you disable or don't configure this policy setting, AutoPlay is enabled. Note: This policy setting appears in both the Computer Configuration and User Configuration folders. If the policy settings conflict, the policy setting in Computer Configuration takes precedence over the policy setting in User Configuration.

## BitLocker

For more information, see [Policy CSP - BitLocker](/windows/client-management/mdm/policy-csp-bitlocker) in the Windows documentation.

- **BitLocker removable drive policy**:  
  This policy setting is used to control the encryption method and cipher strength. The values of this policy determine the strength of the cipher that BitLocker uses for encryption. Enterprises may want to control the encryption level for increased security (AES-256 is stronger than AES-128). If you enable this setting, you can configure an encryption algorithm and key cipher strength for fixed data drives, operating system drives, and removable data drives individually. For fixed and operating system drives, we recommend that you use the XTS-AES algorithm. For removable drives, you should use AES-CBC 128-bit or AES-CBC 256-bit if the drive is used in other devices that aren't running Windows 10, version 1511 or later. Changing the encryption method has no effect if the drive is already encrypted or if encryption is in progress. In these cases, this policy setting is ignored.

- **Internet Explorer Active X controls in protected mode**:  
  This policy setting prevents ActiveX controls from running in Protected Mode when Enhanced Protected Mode is enabled. When a user has an ActiveX control installed that isn't compatible with Enhanced Protected Mode and a website attempts to load the control, Internet Explorer notifies the user and gives the option to run the website in regular Protected Mode. This policy setting disables this notification and forces all websites to run in Enhanced Protected Mode. Enhanced Protected Mode provides additional protection against malicious websites by using 64-bit processes on 64-bit versions of Windows. For computers running at least Windows 8, Enhanced Protected Mode also limits the locations Internet Explorer can read from in the registry and the file system. When Enhanced Protected Mode is enabled, and a user comes across a website that attempts to load an ActiveX control that isn't compatible with Enhanced Protected Mode, Internet Explorer notifies the user and gives the option to disable Enhanced Protected Mode for that particular website. If you enable this policy setting, Internet Explorer won't give the user the option to disable Enhanced Protected Mode. All Protected Mode websites will run in Enhanced Protected Mode. If you disable or don't configure this policy setting, Internet Explorer notifies users and provides an option to run websites with incompatible ActiveX controls in regular Protected Mode.

- **Require client to always digitally sign communications**:  
  This security setting determines whether all secure channel traffic initiated by the domain member must be signed or encrypted. When a computer joins a domain, a computer account is created. After that, when the system starts, it uses the computer account password to create a secure channel with a domain controller for its domain. This secure channel is used to do operations such as NTLM pass through authentication, LSA SID/name Lookup and more. This setting determines if all secure channel traffic initiated by the domain member meets minimum security requirements. Specifically it determines whether all secure channel traffic started by the domain member must be signed or encrypted. If this policy is enabled, then the secure channel won't be established unless either signing or encryption of all secure channel traffic is negotiated. If this policy is disabled, then encryption and signing of all secure channel traffic is negotiated with the Domain Controller in which case the level of signing and encryption depends on the version of the Domain Controller and the settings of the following two policies: Domain member: Digitally encrypt secure channel data (when possible) Domain member: Digitally sign secure channel data (when possible).

  **Default**: Yes

- **Authentication level**:  
  This security setting determines which challenge/response authentication protocol is used for network logons. This choice affects the level of authentication protocol used by clients, the level of session security negotiated, and the level of authentication accepted by servers as follows:

  - *Send LM and NTLM responses* - Clients use LM and NTLM authentication and never use NTLMv2 session security; domain controllers accept LM, NTLM, and NTLMv2 authentication.

  - *Send LM and NTLM - NTLMv2 if negotiated* - Clients use LM and NTLM authentication and use NTLMv2 session security if the server supports it. Domain controllers accept LM, NTLM, and NTLMv2 authentication.

  - *Send NTLM response only* - Clients use NTLM authentication only and use NTLMv2 session security if the server supports it; domain controllers accept LM, NTLM, and NTLMv2 authentication.

  - *Send NTLMv2 response only* - Clients use NTLMv2 authentication only and use NTLMv2 session security if the server supports it; domain controllers accept LM, NTLM, and NTLMv2 authentication.

  - *Send NTLMv2 response only. Refuse LM* - Clients use NTLMv2 authentication only and use NTLMv2 session security if the server supports it. Domain controllers refuse LM (accept only NTLM and NTLMv2 authentication).

  - *Send NTLMv2 response only. Refuse LM and NTLM* - Clients use NTLMv2 authentication only and use NTLMv2 session security if the server supports it. Domain controllers refuse LM and NTLM (accept only NTLMv2 authentication).

  **Default**: Send NTLMv2 response only. Refuse LM and NTLM

- **Prevent clients from sending unencrypted passwords to third party SMB servers**:  
  If this security setting is enabled, the Server Message Block (SMB) redirector can send plaintext passwords to non-Microsoft SMB servers that don't support password encryption during authentication. Sending unencrypted passwords is a security risk.

  **Default**: Yes

- **Require server digitally signing communications always**:  
  This security setting determines whether the SMB client attempts to negotiate SMB packet signing. The server message block (SMB) protocol provides the basis for Microsoft file and print sharing and many other networking operations, such as remote Windows administration. To prevent man-in-the-middle attacks that modify SMB packets in transit, the SMB protocol supports the digital signing of SMB packets. This policy setting determines whether the SMB client component attempts to negotiate SMB packet signing when it connects to an SMB server. If this setting is enabled, the Microsoft network client will ask the server to do SMB packet signing upon session setup. If packet signing has been enabled on the server, packet signing is negotiated. If this policy is disabled, the SMB client will never negotiate SMB packet signing.

  **Default**: Yes

- **Administrator elevation prompt behavior**:  
  This policy setting controls the behavior of the elevation prompt for administrators. The options are:

  - *Elevate without prompting* - Allows privileged accounts to do an operation that requires elevation without requiring consent or credentials. Note: Use this option only in the most constrained environments.

  - *Prompt for credentials on the secure desktop* - When an operation requires elevation of privilege, the user is prompted on the secure desktop to enter a privileged user name and password. If the user enters valid credentials, the operation continues with the user's highest available privilege.

  - *Prompt for consent on the secure desktop* - When an operation requires elevation of privilege, the user is prompted on the secure desktop to select either Permit or Deny. If the user selects Permit, the operation continues with the user's highest available privilege.

  - *Prompt for credentials* - When an operation requires elevation of privilege, the user is prompted to enter an administrative user name and password. If the user enters valid credentials, the operation continues with the applicable privilege.

  - *Prompt for consent* - When an operation requires elevation of privilege, the user is prompted to select either Permit or Deny. If the user selects Permit, the operation continues with the user's highest available privilege.

  - *Prompt for consent for non-Windows binaries* - When an operation for a non-Microsoft application requires elevation of privilege, the user is prompted on the secure desktop to select either Permit or Deny. If the user selects Permit, the operation continues with the user's highest available privilege.

  **Default**: Prompt for consent on the secure desktop

- **Minimum session security for NTLM SSP based clients**:  
  This security setting allows a client to require the negotiation of 128-bit encryption and NTLMv2 session security. These values are dependent on the LAN Manager Authentication Level security setting value. The options are:

  - *Require NTLMv2 session security* - The connection will fail if NTLMv2 protocol isn't negotiated.

  - *Require 128-bit encryption* - The connection will fail if strong encryption (128-bit) isn't negotiated.

  - *Require NTLMv2 and 128-bit encryption*.

  **Default**: Require NTLM V2 128 encryption

- **Smart card removal behavior**:  
  This security setting determines what happens when the smart card for a logged-on user is removed from the smart card reader. The options are:

  - *No action*.

  - *Lock Workstation* - The workstation is locked when the smart card is removed, allowing users to leave the area, take their smart card with them, and still maintain a protected session.

  - *Force Logoff* - the user is automatically logged off when the smart card is removed.

  - *Disconnect Remote Desktop session* - Removal of the smart card disconnects the session without logging the user off. This allows the user to insert the smart card and resume the session later, or at another smart card reader-equipped computer, without having to log on again. If the session is local, this policy functions identically to Lock Workstation.

  **Default**: Lock workstation

- **Block anonymous enumeration of SAM accounts and shares**:  
  This security setting determines whether to allow anonymous enumeration of SAM accounts and shares. Windows allows anonymous users to do certain activities, such as enumerating the names of domain accounts and network shares. This is convenient, for example, when an administrator wants to grant access to users in a trusted domain that doesn't maintain a reciprocal trust. If you don't want to allow anonymous enumeration of SAM accounts and shares, then set this policy to *Yes*.

  **Default**: Yes

- **Block remote logon with blank password**:  
  This security setting determines whether local accounts that aren't password protected can be used to log on from locations other than the physical computer console. If enabled, local accounts that aren't password protected must use the computer's keyboard to log on.

  *Warning*: Computers that aren't in physically secure locations should always enforce strong password policies for all local user accounts. Otherwise, anyone with physical access to the computer can log on by using a user account that doesn't have a password. This is especially important for portable computers.

  If you apply this security policy to the Everyone group, no one can log on through Remote Desktop Services. This setting doesn't affect logons that use domain accounts. It's possible for applications that use remote interactive logons to bypass this setting.

  **Default**: Yes

- **Standard user elevation prompt behavior**:  
  This policy setting controls the behavior of the elevation prompt for standard users.

  - *Automatically deny elevation requests* - When an operation requires elevation of privilege, a configurable access denied error message is displayed. An enterprise that is running desktops as standard user may choose this setting to reduce help desk calls.

  - *Prompt for credentials on the secure desktop* - When an operation requires elevation of privilege, the user is prompted on the secure desktop to enter a different user name and password. If the user enters valid credentials, the operation continues with the applicable privilege.

  - *Prompt for credentials* - When an operation requires elevation of privilege, the user is prompted to enter an administrative user name and password. If the user enters valid credentials, the operation continues with the applicable privilege.

  **Default**: Automatically deny elevation requests

- **Require admin approval mode for administrators**:  
  This policy setting controls the behavior of all User Account Control (UAC) policy settings for the computer. If you change this policy setting, you must restart your computer. The options are:

  - *Not configured* - Admin Approval Mode and all related UAC policy settings are disabled. Note: If this policy setting is disabled, the Security Center notifies you that the overall security of the operating system has been reduced.

  - *Yes* - Admin Approval Mode is enabled. This policy must be enabled and the related UAC policy settings must be set appropriately to allow the built-in Administrator account and all other users who are members of the Administrators group to run in Admin Approval Mode.

  **Default**: Yes

- **Prevent anonymous enumeration of SAM accounts**:  
  This security setting determines what additional permissions are granted for anonymous connections to the computer. Windows allows anonymous users to do certain activities, such as enumerating the names of domain accounts and network shares. This is convenient, for example, when an administrator wants to grant access to users in a trusted domain that doesn't maintain a reciprocal trust. This security option allows additional restrictions to be placed on anonymous connections as follows:

  - *Yes* - Don't allow enumeration of SAM accounts. This option replaces Everyone with Authenticated Users in the security permissions for resources.

  - *Not configured* - No additional restrictions. Rely on default permissions.

  **Default**: *O:BAG:BAD:(A;;RC;;;BA)*

- **Use admin approval mode**:  
  This policy setting controls the behavior of Admin Approval Mode for the built-in Administrator account. The options are:

  - *Yes* - The built-in Administrator account uses Admin Approval Mode. By default, any operation that requires elevation of privilege will prompt the user to approve the operation.

  - *Not Configured* - The built-in Administrator account runs all applications with full administrative privilege.

  **Default**: Yes
  
- **Only allow UI access applications for secure locations**:  
  This policy setting controls whether User Interface Accessibility (UIAccess or UIA) programs can automatically disable the secure desktop for elevation prompts used by a standard user.

  - *Yes* - UIA programs, including Windows Remote Assistance, automatically disable the secure desktop for elevation prompts. If you don't disable the "User Account Control: Switch to the secure desktop when prompting for elevation" policy setting, the prompts appear on the interactive user's desktop instead of the secure desktop.

  - *Not Configured*: - The secure desktop can be disabled only by the user of the interactive desktop or by disabling the "User Account Control: Switch to the secure desktop when prompting for elevation" policy setting.

- **Detect application installations and prompt for elevation**:  
  This policy setting controls the behavior of application installation detection for the computer. The options are:

  - *Enabled* - When an application installation package is detected that requires elevation of privilege, the user is prompted to enter an administrative user name and password. If the user enters valid credentials, the operation continues with the applicable privilege.

  - *Disabled* - Application installation packages aren't detected and prompted for elevation. Enterprises that are running standard user desktops and use delegated installation technologies such as Group Policy Software Installation or Systems Management Server (SMS) should disable this policy setting. In this case, installer detection is unnecessary.

  **Default**: Yes

- **Prevent storing LAN manager hash value on next password change**:  
  This security setting determines if, at the next password change, the LAN Manager (LM) hash value for the new password is stored. The LM hash is relatively weak and prone to attack, as compared with the cryptographically stronger Windows NT hash. Because the LM hash is stored on the local computer in the security database, the passwords can be compromised if the security database is attacked.

These applications aren't considered viruses, malware, or other types of threats, but might do actions on endpoints that adversely affect their performance or use. PUA can also refer to applications that are considered to have a poor reputation. Typical PUA behavior includes: Various types of software bundling Ad injection into web browsers Driver and registry optimizers that detect issues, request payment to fix the errors, but remain on the endpoint and make no changes or optimizations (also known as "rogue antivirus" programs). These applications can increase the risk of your network being infected with malware, cause malware infections to be harder to identify, and can waste IT resources in cleaning up the applications.

## Remote Assistance

For more information, see [Policy CSP - RemoteAssistance](/windows/client-management/mdm/policy-csp-remoteassistance#remoteassistance-solicitedremoteassistance) in the Windows documentation.

- **Remote Assistance solicited**:  
  This policy setting allows you to turn on or turn off Solicited (Ask for) Remote Assistance on this computer.
  
  - *If you enable this policy setting*, users on this computer can use email or file transfer to ask someone for help. Also, users can use instant messaging programs to allow connections to this computer, and you can configure additional Remote Assistance settings.

  - *If you disable this policy setting*, users on this computer can't use email or file transfer to ask someone for help. Also, users can't use instant messaging programs to allow connections to this computer.

  - *If you don't configure this policy setting*, users can turn on or turn off Solicited (Ask for) Remote Assistance themselves in System Properties in Control Panel. Users can also configure Remote Assistance settings.

  If you enable this policy setting, you have two ways to allow helpers to provide Remote Assistance: "Allow helpers to only view the computer" or "Allow helpers to remotely control the computer." The "Maximum ticket time" policy setting sets a limit on the amount of time that a Remote Assistance invitation created by using email or file transfer can remain open. The "Select the method for sending email invitations" setting specifies which email standard to use to send Remote Assistance invitations. Depending on your email program, you can use either the *Mailto* standard (the invitation recipient connects through an Internet link) or the SMAPI (Simple MAPI) standard (the invitation is attached to your email message). This policy setting isn't available in Windows Vista because SMAPI is the only method supported. If you enable this policy setting, you should also enable appropriate firewall exceptions to allow Remote Assistance communications.

## Remote Desktop Services

For more information, see [Policy CSP - RemoteDesktopServices](/windows/client-management/mdm/policy-csp-remotedesktopservices) in the Windows documentation.

- **Block password saving**:  
  Controls whether passwords can be saved on this computer from Remote Desktop Connection. If you enable this setting the password saving checkbox in Remote Desktop Connection is disabled and users can't save passwords. When a user opens an RDP file using Remote Desktop Connection and saves their settings, any password that previously existed in the RDP file are deleted. If you disable this setting or leave it not configured, the user can save passwords using Remote Desktop Connection.  
  [Learn more](/windows/client-management/mdm/policy-csp-remotedesktopservices#remotedesktopservices-donotallowpasswordsaving)

   **Default**: Enabled

- **Secure RPC communication**:  
  Specifies whether a Remote Desktop Session Host server requires secure RPC communication with all clients or allows unsecured communication. You can use this setting to strengthen the security of RPC communication with clients by allowing only authenticated and encrypted requests. If the status is set to Enabled, Remote Desktop Services accepts requests from RPC clients that support secure requests, and doesn't allow unsecured communication with untrusted clients. If the status is set to Disabled, Remote Desktop Services always requests security for all RPC traffic. However, unsecured communication is allowed for RPC clients that don't respond to the request. If the status is set to Not Configured, unsecured communication is allowed. Note: The RPC interface is used for administering and configuring Remote Desktop Services.  
  [Learn more](/windows/client-management/mdm/policy-csp-remotedesktopservices#remotedesktopservices-requiresecurerpccommunication)

  **Default**: Enabled

- **Block drive redirection**:  
  This policy setting specifies whether to prevent the mapping of client drives in a Remote Desktop Services session (drive redirection). By default, an RD Session Host server maps client drives automatically upon connection. Mapped drives appear in the session folder tree in File Explorer or Computer in the format *\<driveletter>* on *\<computername>*. You can use this policy setting to override this behavior. If you enable this policy setting, client drive redirection isn't allowed in Remote Desktop Services sessions, and Clipboard file copy redirection isn't allowed on computers running Windows Server 2003, Windows 8, and Windows XP. If you disable this policy setting, client drive redirection is always allowed. Also, Clipboard file copy redirection is always allowed if Clipboard redirection is allowed. If you don't configure this policy setting, client drive redirection and Clipboard file copy redirection aren't specified at the Group Policy level.  
  [Learn more](/windows/client-management/mdm/policy-csp-remotedesktopservices#remotedesktopservices-donotallowdriveredirection)

  **Default**: Enabled

- **Prompt for password upon connection**:  
  This policy setting specifies whether Remote Desktop Services always prompts the client for a password upon connection. You can use this setting to enforce a password prompt for users logging on to Remote Desktop Services, even if they already provided the password in the Remote Desktop Connection client. By default, Remote Desktop Services allows users to automatically log on by entering a password in the Remote Desktop Connection client. If you enable this policy setting, users can't automatically log on to Remote Desktop Services by supplying their passwords in the Remote Desktop Connection client. they're prompted for a password to log on. If you disable this policy setting, users can always log on to Remote Desktop Services automatically by supplying their passwords in the Remote Desktop Connection client. If you don't configure this policy setting, automatic logon isn't specified at the Group Policy level.  
  [Learn more](/windows/client-management/mdm/policy-csp-remotedesktopservices#remotedesktopservices-promptforpassworduponconnection)

  **Default**: Enabled

- **Remote desktop services client connection encryption level**:  
  Specifies whether to require the use of a specific encryption level to secure communications between client computers and RD Session Host servers during Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) connections. This policy only applies when you're using native RDP encryption. However, native RDP encryption (as opposed to SSL encryption) isn't recommended. This policy doesn't apply to SSL encryption. If you enable this policy setting, all communications between clients and RD Session Host servers during remote connections must use the encryption method specified in this setting. By default, the encryption level is set to High. The following encryption methods are available:

  - *High* - The High setting encrypts data sent from the client to the server and from the server to the client by using strong 128-bit encryption. Use this encryption level in environments that contain only 128-bit clients (for example, clients that run Remote Desktop Connection). Clients that don't support this encryption level can't connect to RD Session Host servers.

  - *Client Compatible* - The Client Compatible setting encrypts data sent between the client and the server at the maximum key strength supported by the client. Use this encryption level in environments that include clients that don't support 128-bit encryption.

  - *Low* - The Low setting encrypts only data sent from the client to the server by using 56-bit encryption.  
  
  If you disable or don't configure this setting, the encryption level to be used for remote connections to RD Session Host servers isn't enforced through Group Policy. Important FIPS compliance can be configured through the System cryptography. Use FIPS-compliant algorithms for encryption, hashing, and signing settings in Group Policy (under Computer Configuration\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Local Policies\Security Options.) The FIPS-compliant setting encrypts and decrypts data sent from the client to the server and from the server to the client, with the Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 140 encryption algorithms, by using Microsoft cryptographic modules. Use this encryption level when communications between clients and RD Session Host servers requires the highest level of encryption.

## Remote Procedure Call

For more information, see [Policy CSP - RemoteProcedureCall](/windows/client-management/mdm/policy-csp-remoteprocedurecall) in the Windows documentation.

- **RPC unauthenticated client options**:  
  This policy setting controls how the RPC server runtime handles unauthenticated RPC clients connecting to RPC servers. This policy setting impacts all RPC applications. In a domain environment, use this policy setting with caution as it can impact a wide range of functionality including group policy processing itself. Reverting a change to this policy setting can require manual intervention on each affected machine. Don't apply this policy setting to a domain controller. If you disable this policy setting, the RPC server runtime uses the value of "Authenticated" on Windows Client, and the value of "None" on Windows Server versions that support this policy setting. If you don't configure this policy setting, it remains disabled. The RPC server runtime behaves as though it was enabled with the value of "Authenticated" used for Windows Client and the value of "None" used for Server SKUs that support this policy setting. If you enable this policy setting, it directs the RPC server runtime to restrict unauthenticated RPC clients connecting to RPC servers running on a machine. A client is considered an authenticated client if it uses a named pipe to communicate with the server or if it uses RPC Security. RPC Interfaces that have specifically requested to be accessible by unauthenticated clients may be exempt from this restriction, depending on the selected value for this policy setting.

  - *None* allows all RPC clients to connect to RPC Servers running on the machine on which the policy setting is applied.

  - *Authenticated* allows only authenticated RPC Clients (per the definition above) to connect to RPC Servers running on the machine on which the policy setting is applied. Exemptions are granted to interfaces that have requested them.

  - *Authenticated without exceptions* allows only authenticated RPC Clients (per the definition above) to connect to RPC Servers running on the machine on which the policy setting is applied. No exceptions are allowed. Note: This policy setting won't be applied until the system is rebooted.

## Search

For more information, see [Policy CSP - Search](/windows/client-management/mdm/policy-csp-search) in the Windows documentation.

- **Disable indexing encrypted items**:  
  Allows or disallows the indexing of items. This switch is for the Windows Search Indexer, which controls whether it will index items that are encrypted, such as the Windows Information Protection (WIP) protected files. When the policy is enabled, WIP protected items are indexed and the metadata about them are stored in an unencrypted location. The metadata includes things like file path and date modified. When the policy is disabled, the WIP protected items aren't indexed and don't show up in the results in Cortana or file explorer. There may also be a performance impact on photos and Groove apps if there are many WIP protected media files on the device.

## System

For more information, see [Policy CSP - System](/windows/client-management/mdm/policy-csp-system) in the Windows documentation.

- **System boot start driver initialization**:  
  This policy setting allows you to specify which boot-start drivers are initialized based on a classification determined by an Early Launch Antimalware boot-start driver. The Early Launch Antimalware boot-start driver can return the following classifications for each boot-start driver:

  - *Good* - The driver has been signed and hasn't been tampered with.

  - *Bad* - The driver has been identified as malware. We recommend that you don't allow known bad drivers to be initialized.

  - *Bad, but required for boot* - The driver has been identified as malware, but the computer can't successfully boot without loading this driver.

  - *Unknown* - This driver hasn't been attested to by your malware detection application and hasn't been classified by the Early Launch Antimalware boot-start driver.

  If you enable this policy setting, you can choose which boot-start drivers to initialize the next time the computer is started. If you disable or don't configure this policy setting, the boot start drivers determined to be Good, Unknown, or Bad but Boot Critical are initialized and the initialization of drivers determined to be Bad is skipped. If your malware detection application doesn't include an Early Launch Antimalware boot-start driver or if your Early Launch Antimalware boot-start driver has been disabled, this setting has no effect and all boot-start drivers are initialized.

- **Block connection to non-domain networks**:  
  This policy setting prevents computers from connecting to both a domain-based network and a non-domain based network at the same time. If this policy setting is enabled, the computer responds to automatic and manual network connection attempts based on the following circumstances:

  - *Automatic connection attempts* - When the computer is already connected to a domain-based network, all automatic connection attempts to non-domain networks are blocked. When the computer is already connected to a non-domain based network, automatic connection attempts to domain-based networks are blocked.

  - *Manual connection attempts* - When the computer is already connected to either a non-domain based network or a domain-based network over media other than Ethernet, and a user attempts to create a manual connection to an additional network in violation of this policy setting, the existing network connection disconnects, and the manual connection is allowed. When the computer is already connected to either a non-domain based network or a domain-based network over Ethernet, and a user attempts to create a manual connection to an additional network in violation of this policy setting, the existing Ethernet connection is maintained and the manual connection attempt is blocked.

  If this policy setting isn't configured or is disabled, computers are allowed to connect simultaneously to both domain and non-domain networks.
