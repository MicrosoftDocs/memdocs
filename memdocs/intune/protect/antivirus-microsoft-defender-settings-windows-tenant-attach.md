# Settings for Microsoft Defender Antivirus policy for tenant attached devices in Microsoft Intune

View the Microsoft Defender Antivirus settings you can manage with the **Microsoft Defender Antivirus Policy (ConfigMgr)** profile from Intune. The profile is available when you configure Intune [Endpoint security Antivirus policy](../protect/endpoint-security-antivirus-policy.md), and the policy deploys to devices you manage with Configuration Manager when you've configured the [tenant attach](../protect/tenant-attach-intune.md) scenario.

## Cloud protection

- **Turn on cloud-delivered protection**  
  CSP: [AllowCloudProtection](/windows/client-management/mdm/policy-csp-defender#defender-allowcloudprotection)

- **Defender cloud extended timeout in seconds**  
  CSP: [CloudExtendedTimeout](/windows/client-management/mdm/policy-csp-defender#defender-cloudextendedtimeout)
