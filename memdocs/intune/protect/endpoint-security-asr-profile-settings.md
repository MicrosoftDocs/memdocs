## Device control profile

### Device Control

- **Hardware device installation by device identifiers**  
  [PreventInstallationOfMatchingDeviceIDs](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2066794)  
  
  This setting allows you to specify a list of Plug and Play hardware IDs and compatible IDs for devices that Windows is prevented from installing. This policy setting takes precedence over any other policy setting that allows Windows to install a device.  If you enable this policy setting on a remote desktop server, the policy setting affects redirection of the specified devices from a remote desktop client to the remote desktop server.

  - **Not configured**
  - **Allow hardware device installation** - Devices can be installed and updated as allowed or prevented by other policy settings.
  - **Block hardware device installation** (*default*) - Windows is prevented from installing a device whose hardware ID or compatible ID appears in a list you define.

  When set to *Block hardware device installation* you can configure the following settings:

  - **Remove matching hardware devices**

    This setting is available only when *Hardware device installation by device identifiers* is set to *Block hardware device installation*.
    - **Yes**
    - **Not configured**

  - **Hardware device identifiers that are blocked**  

    This setting is available only when *Hardware device installation by device identifiers* is set to *Block hardware device installation*.

    Select **Add**, and then specify the hardware device identifier you want to block.

- **Hardware device installation by setup classes**  
  CSP: [DeviceInstallation/AllowInstallationOfMatchingDeviceSetupClasses](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2067048)  
  
  This policy setting allows you to specify a list of device setup class globally unique identifiers (GUIDs) for device drivers that Windows is prevented from installing. This policy setting takes precedence over any other policy setting that allows Windows to install a device. If you enable this policy setting on a remote desktop server, the policy setting affects redirection of the specified devices from a remote desktop client to the remote desktop server.

  - **Not configured**
  - **Allow hardware device installation** - Windows can install and update devices as allowed or prevented by other policy settings.
  - **Block hardware device installation** (*default*) - Windows is prevented from installing a device whose setup class GUIDs appear in a list you define.

  When set to *Block hardware device installation* you can configure *Remove matching hardware devices* and *Hardware device identifiers that are blocked*.

  - **Remove matching hardware devices**

    This setting is available only when *Hardware device installation by device identifiers* is set to *Block hardware device installation*.
    - **Yes**
    - **Not configured**

  - **Hardware device identifiers that are blocked**

    This setting is available only when *Hardware device installation by device identifiers* is set to *Block hardware device installation*.

    Select **Add**, and then specify the hardware device identifier you want to block.

- **Scan removable drives during full scan**  
  CSP: [Defender/AllowFullScanRemovableDriveScanning](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2113946)

  - **Not configured** (*default*) - The setting returns to client default, which scans removable drives, however the user can disable this scan.

- **Block direct memory access**  
  CSP: [DataProtection/AllowDirectMemoryAccess](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2067031)

  This policy setting is only enforced when BitLocker or device encryption is enabled.

  - **Not configured** (*default*)
  - **Yes** - block direct memory access (DMA) for all hot pluggable PCI downstream ports until a user logs into Windows. After a user logs in, Windows enumerates the PCI devices connected to the host plug PCI ports. Every time the user locks the machine, DMA is blocked on hot plug PCI ports with no children devices until the user logs in again. Devices which were already enumerated when the machine was unlocked will continue to function until unplugged.

- **Enumeration of external devices incompatible with Kernel DMA Protection**  
  CSP: [DmaGuard/DeviceEnumerationPolicy](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/client-management/mdm/policy-csp-dmaguard#dmaguard-deviceenumerationpolicy)

  This policy can provide additional security against external DMA capable devices. It allows for more control over the enumeration of external DMA capable devices incompatible with DMA Remapping/device memory isolation and sandboxing.

  This policy only takes effect when Kernel DMA Protection is supported and enabled by the system firmware. Kernel DMA Protection is a platform feature that must be supported by the system at the time of manufacturing. To check if the system supports Kernel DMA Protection, check the Kernel DMA Protection field in the Summary page of MSINFO32.exe.

  - **Import** - Import a .csv file that contains a list of bluetooth services and profiles, as hex strings, such as `{782AFCFC-7CAA-436C-8BF0-78CD0FFBD4AF}`

## Exploit protection profile

### Exploit protection

- **Upload XML**  
  CSP: [ExploitProtectionSettings](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2067035)

  Enables the IT admin to push out a configuration representing the desired system and application mitigation options to all the devices in the organization. The configuration is represented by an XML file. Exploit protection can help protect devices from malware that use exploits to spread and infect. You use the Windows Security app or PowerShell to create a set of mitigations (known as a configuration). You can then export this configuration as an XML file and share it with multiple machines on your network so they all have the same set of mitigation settings. You can also convert and import an existing EMET configuration XML file into an exploit protection configuration XML.

  Choose **Select XML File**, specify the XML filet upload, and then click **Select**.
  - **Not configured** (*default*)
  - **Yes**

- **Block users from editing the Exploit Guard protection interface**  
  CSP: [DisallowExploitProtectionOverride](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2067239)
