## Attack surface reduction (MDM)

### App and browser isolation profile

> [!NOTE]  
> This section details the settings in App and browser isolation profiles created before April 18, 2023. Profiles created after that date use a new settings format as found in the Settings Catalog. With this change you can no longer create new versions of the old profile and they are no longer being developed. Although you can no longer create new instances of the older profile, you can continue to edit and use instances of it that you previously created.
>
> For profiles that use the new settings format, Intune no longer maintains a list of each setting by name. Instead, the name of each setting, its configuration options, and its explanatory text you see in the Microsoft Intune admin center are taken directly from the settings authoritative content. That content can provide more information about the use of the setting in its proper context. When viewing a settings information text, you can use its *Learn more* link to open that content.

  - **Allow list** - Use *Add*, *Import*, and *Export* to manage a list of device identifiers.

- **Block hardware device installation by device instance identifiers**  
  If you enable this policy setting on a remote desktop server, the policy setting affects redirection of the specified devices from a remote desktop client to the remote desktop server.
  - **Not configured** *(default)*
  - **Yes** - Specify a list of Plug and Play hardware IDs and compatible IDs for devices that Windows is prevented from installing. This policy takes precedence over any other policy setting that allows Windows to install a device. If you enable this policy setting on a remote desktop server, the policy setting affects redirection of the specified devices from a remote desktop client to the remote desktop server.
  - **No**

  When set to *Yes* you can configure the following options:  
  - **Remove matching hardware devices**  
    - **Yes**
    - **Not configured** *(default)*

  - **Block list** - Use *Add*, *Import*, and *Export* to manage a list of device identifiers.

- **Block write access to removable storage**  
  CSP: [RemovableDiskDenyWriteAccess](/windows/client-management/mdm/policy-csp-storage#storage-removablediskdenywriteaccess)

  - **Not configured** *(default)*
  - **Yes** - Write access is denied to removable storage.
  - **No** - Write access is allowed.

- **Scan removable drives during full scan**  
  CSP: [Defender/AllowFullScanRemovableDriveScanning](/windows/client-management/mdm/policy-csp-defender#defender-allowfullscanremovabledrivescanning)

  - **Not configured** (*default*) - The setting returns to client default, which scans removable drives, however the user can disable this scan.
  - **Yes** - During a full scan, removable drives (like USB flash drives) are scanned.

- **Block direct memory access**  
  CSP: [DataProtection/AllowDirectMemoryAccess](/windows/client-management/mdm/policy-csp-dataprotection#dataprotection-allowdirectmemoryaccess)

  This policy setting is only enforced when BitLocker or device encryption is enabled.

  - **Not configured** (*default*)
  - **Yes** - block direct memory access (DMA) for all hot pluggable PCI downstream ports until a user logs into Windows. After a user logs in, Windows enumerates the PCI devices connected to the host plug PCI ports. Every time the user locks the machine, DMA is blocked on hot plug PCI ports with no children devices until the user logs in again. Devices that were already enumerated when the machine was unlocked will continue to function until unplugged.

- **Enumeration of external devices incompatible with Kernel DMA Protection**  
  CSP: [DmaGuard/DeviceEnumerationPolicy](/windows/client-management/mdm/policy-csp-dmaguard#dmaguard-deviceenumerationpolicy)

  This policy can provide additional security against external DMA capable devices. It allows for more control over the enumeration of external DMA capable devices incompatible with DMA Remapping/device memory isolation and sandboxing.

  This policy only takes effect when Kernel DMA Protection is supported and enabled by the system firmware. Kernel DMA Protection is a platform feature that must be supported by the system at the time of manufacturing. To check if the system supports Kernel DMA Protection, check the Kernel DMA Protection field in the Summary page of MSINFO32.exe.

### Exploit protection profile

#### Exploit protection

> [!NOTE]  
> This section details the settings you can find in Exploit protection profiles created before April 5, 2022. Profiles created after that date use a new settings format as found in the Settings Catalog. With this change you can no longer create new versions of the old profile and they are no longer being developed. Although you can no longer create new instances of the older profile, you can continue to edit and use instances of it that you previously created.
>
> For profiles that use the new settings format, Intune no longer maintains a list of each setting by name. Instead, the name of each setting, its configuration options, and its explanatory text you see in the Microsoft Intune admin center are taken directly from the settings authoritative content. That content can provide more information about the use of the setting in its proper context. When viewing a settings information text, you can use its *Learn more* link to open that content.

- **Upload XML**  
  CSP: [ExploitProtectionSettings](/windows/client-management/mdm/policy-csp-exploitguard#exploitguard-exploitprotectionsettings)

  Enables the IT admin to push out a configuration representing the desired system and application mitigation options to all the devices in the organization. The configuration is represented by an XML file. Exploit protection can help protect devices from malware that use exploits to spread and infect. You use the Windows Security app or PowerShell to create a set of mitigations (known as a configuration). You can then export this configuration as an XML file and share it with multiple machines on your network so they all have the same set of mitigation settings. You can also convert and import an existing EMET configuration XML file into an exploit protection configuration XML.

  Choose **Select XML File**, specify the XML filet upload, and then click **Select**.
  - **Not configured** (*default*)
