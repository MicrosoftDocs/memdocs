## Docker commands

The following are common commands for Docker that can be of use if you must investigate problems on a tunnel server.

Command-line interface:

- `docker ps –a` – See all containers.
  - *mstunnel-server* – This container runs the **ocserv** server components, and uses inbound Port 443 *(default)*, or a custom port configuration.
  - *mstunnel-agent* - This container runs the Intune connector and uses outbound Port 443.

- **To restart Docker**:  
  - `systemctl restart docker`

- **To run something in a container**:
  - `docker exec –it mstunnel-server bash`
  - `docker exec –it mstunnel-agent bash`

## Linux commands

The following are common Linux commands you might use with a tunnel server.

- `sudo su` – Makes you root on the box.  Use this command before running the following commands, and before you run mstunnel-setup.

- `ls` – list contents of the directory.

- `ls – l` – List contents of directory including timestamps.

- `cd` – change to another directory. For example, `cd /etc/test/stuff` changes you from the *root* directory to the *etc* subfolder > to the *test* subfolder > and then to the *stuff* folder.

- `cp <source> <destination>` - Useful for copying the certs to the right location.

- `ln –s <source> <target>` - Create a softlink.

- `curl <URL>` – Checks access to a website. For example: `curl https://microsoft.com`

- `./<filename>` -  Run a script.
