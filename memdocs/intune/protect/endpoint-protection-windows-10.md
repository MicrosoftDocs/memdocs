# Windows 10 (and later) settings to protect devices using Intune

> [!NOTE]
> [!INCLUDE [not-all-settings-are-documented](../includes/not-all-settings-are-documented.md)]

Microsoft Intune includes many settings to help protect your devices. This article describes some of the settings you can enable and configure in Windows 10 and newer devices. These settings are created in an endpoint protection configuration profile in Intune to control security, including BitLocker and Microsoft Defender.  

To configure Microsoft Defender Antivirus, see [Windows 10 device restrictions](../configuration/device-restrictions-windows-10.md#microsoft-defender-antivirus).  

## Before you begin  

[Create an endpoint protection device configuration profile](endpoint-protection-configure.md).  

For more information about configuration service providers (CSPs), see [Configuration service provider reference](/windows/client-management/mdm/configuration-service-provider-reference).  

## Microsoft Defender Application Guard  

While using Microsoft Edge, Microsoft Defender Application Guard protects your environment from sites that aren't trusted by your organization. When users visit sites that aren't listed in your isolated network boundary, the sites open in a Hyper-V virtual browsing session. Trusted sites are defined by a network boundary, which are configured in Device Configuration. For more information, see [Create a network boundary on Windows devices](../configuration/network-boundary-windows.md).

Application Guard is only available for Windows 10 (64-bit) devices. Using this profile installs a Win32 component to activate Application Guard.

## Microsoft Defender Exploit Guard  

Use [exploit protection](/windows/security/threat-protection/microsoft-defender-atp/exploit-protection) to manage and reduce the attack surface of apps used by your employees.  

### Attack Surface Reduction  

Attack surface reduction rules help prevent behaviors malware often uses to infect computers with malicious code.  

#### Attack Surface Reduction rules  

To learn more, see [Attack surface reduction rules](/windows/security/threat-protection/microsoft-defender-atp/attack-surface-reduction) in the Microsoft Defender for Endpoint documentation.

**Merge behavior for Attack surface reduction rules in Intune**:

Attack surface reduction rules support a merger of settings from different policies, to create a superset of policy for each device. Only the settings that are not in conflict are merged, while those that are in conflict are not added to the superset of rules. Previously, if two policies included conflicts for a single setting, both policies were flagged as being in conflict, and no settings from either profile would be deployed.

Attack surface reduction rule merge behavior is as follows:

- Attack surface reduction rules from the following profiles are evaluated for each device the rules apply to:  
  - Devices > Configuration policy > Endpoint protection profile > Microsoft Defender Exploit Guard > **Attack Surface Reduction**
  - Endpoint security > Attack surface reduction policy > **Attack surface reduction rules**
  - Endpoint security > Security baselines > Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Baseline > **Attack Surface Reduction Rules**.
- Settings that do not have conflicts are added to a superset of policy for the device.
- When two or more policies have conflicting settings, the conflicting settings are not added to the combined policy, while settings that don’t conflict are added to the superset policy that applies to a device.
- Only the configurations for conflicting settings are held back.

**Settings in this profile**:

- **Flag credential stealing from the Windows local security authority subsystem**  
  **Default**: Not configured  
  Rule: [Block credential stealing from the Windows local security authority subsystem (lsass.exe)](/windows/security/threat-protection/microsoft-defender-atp/attack-surface-reduction#block-credential-stealing-from-the-windows-local-security-authority-subsystem)

  - **Audit only**: - Users and apps aren't blocked from connecting to dangerous domains. Administrators can see this activity in Microsoft Defender Security Center.  

### Exploit protection  

- **Upload XML**  
  **Default**: *Not configured*  

  To use exploit protection to [protect devices from exploits](/windows/security/threat-protection/microsoft-defender-atp/microsoft-defender-advanced-threat-protection), create an XML file that includes the system and application mitigation settings you want. There are two methods to create the XML file:  

  - *PowerShell* - Use one or more of the *Get-ProcessMitigation*, *Set-ProcessMitigation*, and *ConvertTo-ProcessMitigationPolicy* PowerShell cmdlets. The cmdlets configure mitigation settings, and export an XML representation of them.  

  - *Microsoft Defender Security Center UI* - In the Microsoft Defender Security Center, click on App & browser control and then scroll to the bottom of the resulting screen to find Exploit Protection. First, use the System settings and Program settings tabs to configure mitigation settings. Then, find the Export settings link at the bottom of the screen to export an XML representation of them.  

- **User editing of the exploit protection interface**  
  **Default**: Not configured  
  ExploitGuard CSP: [ExploitProtectionSettings](/windows/client-management/mdm/policy-csp-exploitguard)

  **Default**: Not configured  
   CSP: [AppLocker CSP](/windows/client-management/mdm/applocker-csp)  

  - **Enforce** - Choose the application control code integrity policies for your users' devices.  
  
    After being enabled on a device, Application Control can only be disabled by changing the mode from *Enforce* to *Audit only*. Changing the mode from *Enforce* to *Not Configured* results in Application Control continuing to be enforced on assigned devices.  

  - **Not Configured** - Application Control is not added to devices. However, settings that were previously added continue to be enforced on assigned devices. 
 
  - **Audit only** - Applications aren't blocked. All events are logged in the local client's logs.  

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you use this setting, AppLocker CSP behaviour currently prompts end user to reboot their machine when a policy is deployed.

## Microsoft Defender Credential Guard  

Microsoft Defender Credential Guard protects against credential theft attacks. It isolates secrets so that only privileged system software can access them.  

- **Credential Guard**  
  **Default**: Disable  
  [DeviceGuard CSP](/windows/client-management/mdm/policy-csp-deviceguard)  

  - **Disable** - Turn off Credential Guard remotely, if it was previously turned on with the **Enabled without UEFI lock** option.​  

  - **Enable with UEFI lock** - Credential Guard can't be disabled remotely by using a registry key or group policy.  

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you use this setting, and then later want to disable Credential Guard, you must set the Group Policy to **Disabled**. And, physically clear the UEFI configuration information from each computer. As long as the UEFI configuration persists, Credential Guard is enabled.​  

  - **Enable without UEFI lock** - Allows Credential Guard to be disabled remotely by using Group Policy. The devices that use this setting must be running Windows 10 version 1511 and newer.​  

  When you *enable* Credential Guard, the following required features are also enabled:  
  
  - **Virtualization-based Security** (VBS)  
    Turns on during the next reboot. Virtualization-based security uses the Windows Hypervisor to provide support for security services.  
  - **Secure Boot with Directory Memory Access**  
    Turns on VBS with Secure Boot and direct memory access (DMA) protections. DMA protections require hardware support, and are only enabled on correctly configured devices.  

## Microsoft Defender Security Center  

Microsoft Defender Security Center operates as a separate app or process from each of the individual features. It displays notifications through the Action Center. It acts as a collector or single place to see the status and run some configuration for each of the features. Find out more in the [Microsoft Defender](/windows/threat-protection/windows-defender-security-center/windows-defender-security-center) docs.
