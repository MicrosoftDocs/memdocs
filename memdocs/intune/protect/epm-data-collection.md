# Data collection and privacy for Endpoint Privilege Management

[!INCLUDE [intune-add-on-note](../includes/intune-add-on-note.md)]

With Microsoft Intune **Endpoint Privilege Management (EPM)** your organizationâ€™s users can run as a standard user (without administrator rights) and complete tasks that require elevated privileges. Tasks that commonly require administrative privileges are application installs (like Microsoft 365 Applications), updating device drivers, and running certain Windows diagnostics.

Endpoint Privilege Management supports your zero-trust journey by helping your organization achieve a broad user base running with least privilege, while allowing users to still run tasks allowed by your organization to remain productive.

This article provides information about the data that EPM can collect from devices.

Applies to:

- Windows 10
- Windows 11

## Overview of data collection

Endpoint Privilege Management on devices can be configured to report on the following data types:

- Diagnostic data
- Usage data

When configuring EPM, you configure the *Send elevation data for reporting* and *Reporting scope* settings in an Intune [Windows elevation settings policy](../protect/epm-policies.md#about-windows-elevation-settings-policy) to determine which data Intune reports to Microsoft.

## Diagnostic Data

Diagnostic data is event data that is used by Microsoft to monitor the health of the client side components that provide the capability to elevate as a standard user.

## Usage Data

Usage data is elevation data that is used by customers to determine what elevations occur in their environment. This data is stored with your Intune infrastructure and is used to populate the [elevation reports](../protect/epm-reports.md). When configuring *reporting scope*, you configure what scope of data is collected and can choose between:

- *Diagnostic data* only
- *Diagnostic data and all endpoint elevations* that take place on a device
- *Diagnostic data and managed elevations only*
