# Data Apple sends to Intune

When any of the following Apple services are enabled on a device, Microsoft Intune establishes a connection with Apple to share user and device information:

- [Apple Device Enrollment Program (DEP)](../enrollment/device-enrollment-program-enroll-ios.md)
- [Apple MDM Push certificate (APNs)](../enrollment/apple-mdm-push-certificate-get.md)
- [Apple School Manager (ASM)](/schooldatasync/apple-school-manager-integration-with-intune-for-education-and-school-data-sync)
- [Apple Volume Purchase Program (VPP)](../apps/vpp-apps-ios.md)

Before Microsoft Intune can establish a connection, you must create an Apple account for each of the Apple services.

> [!NOTE]
> Consistent with Microsoft and Apple policy, we do not sell any data collected by our service to any third parties for any reason.

The following table lists the data that an Apple device sends to Intune. [Intune also sends data to Apple](data-intune-sends-to-apple.md).
