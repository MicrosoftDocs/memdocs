# Configure Microsoft Defender for Endpoint web protection on Android devices managed by Intune

When you integrate [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint](../protect/advanced-threat-protection-configure.md) with Microsoft Intune, you can use device configuration profiles to modify some Defender for Endpoint settings on Android devices.

By default, Microsoft Defender for Endpoint for Android includes and enables the Microsoft Defender for Endpoint [Web protection](/windows/security/threat-protection/microsoft-defender-atp/web-protection-overview) feature that can help to secure devices against web threats and protect users from phishing attacks.

While enabled by default, there are valid reasons to disable it on some Android devices. For example, you might decide to use only the Defender for Endpoint app scan feature or to prevent web protection from using your VPN while it scans for harmful URLs.

With Intune device configuration policy, you can turn off all or part of the web protection feature. The method you use and the capabilities you can disable depend on how the Android device is enrolled with Intune:

- **Android device administrator**. Use a configuration profile to set custom OMA-URI settings on the device that disable the entire web protection feature or that disable only the use of VPNs. For general information about custom settings for Android devices, see [Use custom settings for Android devices in Microsoft Intune](../configuration/custom-settings-android.md).

- **Android Enterprise personally owned work profile**. Use an app configuration profile and the configuration designer to disable web protection. This method and enrollment type support disabling all web protection capabilities but don't support disabling only the use of VPNs. For general information about app configuration policies, see [Use the configuration designer](../apps/app-configuration-policies-use-android.md#use-the-configuration-designer).

- **Android Enterprise Fully Managed profile**. Use an app configuration profile and the [configuration designer](../apps/app-configuration-policies-use-android.md#use-the-configuration-designer) to disable the entire web protection feature or to disable only the use of VPNs.

To configure web protection on devices, use the following procedures to create and deploy the applicable configuration.

## Disable web protection for Android device administrator

[!INCLUDE [android_device_administrator_support](../includes/android-device-administrator-support.md)]

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431).

2. Select **Devices** > **Manage devices** > **Configuration** > On the *Policies* tab, select **+ Create**.

3. Enter these settings:

   - **Platform**: Select **Android device administrator**.
   - **Profile**: Select **Custom**.

   Select **Create**.

4. In **Basics**, enter these details:

   - **Name**: Enter a descriptive name for the profile. Name your profiles so you can easily identify them later. For example, **Android custom profile for  Defender for Endpoint web protection**.
   - **Description**: Enter a description for the profile. This setting is optional but recommended.

5. In **Configuration settings**, select **Add**.

   Specify settings for the configuration you want to deploy:

   - **Disable web protection**:
     - **Name**: Enter a unique name for this OMA-URI setting so you can find it easily. For example, **Disable Defender for Endpoint web protection**.
     - **Description**: (Optional) Enter a description that provides an overview of the setting and any other important details.
     - **OMA-URI**: Enter `./Vendor/MSFT/DefenderATP/AntiPhishing`
     - **Data type**: Select **Integer** in the drop-down list.
     - **Value**: To disable web protection, set *Value* to **0**. To enable web protection, enter **1**, which is the default.

   - **Disable only the use of VPN by web protection**:
     - **Name**: Enter a unique name for this OMA-URI setting so you can find it easily. For example, **Disable Microsoft Defender for Endpoint web protection VPN**.
     - **Description**: (Optional) Enter a description that provides an overview of the setting and any other important details.
     - **OMA-URI**: Enter `./Vendor/MSFT/DefenderATP/Vpn`
     - **Data type**: Select **Integer** in the drop-down list.
     - **Value**: To disable the VPN-based scan, set *Value* to **0**. To enable the VPN-based scan, enter **1**, which is the default.

   Select **Add** to save the OMA-URI settings configuration, and then select **Next** to continue.

6. In **Assignments**, specify the groups that receive the profile. For more information on assigning profiles, see [Assign user and device profiles](../configuration/device-profile-assign.md).

7. In **Review + create**, when you're done, select **Create**. The new profile is displayed in the list when you select the policy type for the profile you created.

## Disable web protection for the Android Enterprise personally owned work profile

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431).

2. Select **Apps** > **App configuration policies** > **Add**, and then select **Managed devices**.

   > [!NOTE]
   >
   > The **Web Protection** configuration key is deprecated. If you've used this key in the past, complete the previous steps to re-configure the setting by setting the keys **Anti-Phishing** and **VPN** to enable or disable web protection.

Complete the same configuration steps [described previously](#disable-web-protection-for-the-android-enterprise-personally-owned-work-profile), and add web protection configuration keys **Anti-phishing** and **VPN**.
