## Attack Surface Reduction Rules

To learn more, see [Attack surface reduction rules](/windows/security/threat-protection/microsoft-defender-atp/attack-surface-reduction) in the Microsoft Defender for Endpoint documentation.

**Merge behavior for Attack surface reduction rules in Intune**:

  Attack surface reduction rules support a merger of settings from different policies, to create a superset of policy for each device. Only the settings that are not in conflict are merged, while those that are in conflict are not added to the superset of rules. Previously, if two policies included conflicts for a single setting, both policies were flagged as being in conflict, and no settings from either profile would be deployed.

  Attack surface reduction rule merge behavior is as follows:
  - Attack surface reduction rules from the following profiles are evaluated for each device the rules apply to:  
    - Devices > Configuration policy > Endpoint protection profile > Microsoft Defender Exploit Guard > **Attack Surface Reduction**
    - Endpoint security > Attack surface reduction policy > **Attack surface reduction rules**
    - Endpoint security > Security baselines > Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Baseline > **Attack Surface Reduction Rules**.
  - Settings that do not have conflicts are added to a superset of policy for the device.
  - When two or more policies have conflicting settings, the conflicting settings are not added to the combined policy, while settings that donâ€™t conflict are added to the superset policy that applies to a device.
  - Only the configurations for conflicting settings are held back.

**Settings in this profile**:

For more information, see [WindowsDefenderApplicationGuard CSP](/windows/client-management/mdm/windowsdefenderapplicationguard-csp) in the Windows documentation.  

While using Microsoft Edge, Microsoft Defender Application Guard protects your environment from sites that aren't trusted by your organization. When users visit sites that aren't listed in your isolated network boundary, the sites open in a Hyper-V virtual browsing session. Trusted sites are defined by a network boundary.  

- **Turn on Application Guard for Edge (Options)**  
  CSP: [Settings/AllowWindowsDefenderApplicationGuard](/windows/client-management/mdm/windowsdefenderapplicationguard-csp#allowwindowsdefenderapplicationguard)
  
  - **Enabled for Edge** (*default*) - Application Guard opens unapproved sites in a Hyper-V virtualized browsing container.
  - **Not configured** - Any site (trusted and untrusted) opens on the device, and not in a virtualized container.  
  
  When set to *Enable for Edge*, you can configure *Block external content from non-enterprise approved sites* and *Clipboard behavior*.

  - **Block external content from non-enterprise approved sites**  
    CSP: [Settings/BlockNonEnterpriseContent](/windows/client-management/mdm/windowsdefenderapplicationguard-csp#blocknonenterprisecontent)

    - **Yes** (*default*) - Block content from unapproved websites from loading.
    - **Not configured** - Non-enterprise sites can open on the device

- **Enable full disk encryption for OS and fixed data drives**  
  CSP: [RequireDeviceEncryption](/windows/client-management/mdm/bitlocker-csp#requiredeviceencryption)

  If the drive was encrypted before this policy applied, no extra action is taken. If the encryption method and options match that of this policy, configuration should return success. If an in-place BitLocker configuration option doesn't match this policy, configuration will likely return an error.
  
  To apply this policy to a disk already encrypted, decrypt the drive and reapply the MDM policy. Windows default is to not require BitLocker drive encryption, however on Azure AD Join and Microsoft Account (MSA) registration/login automatic encryption may apply enabling BitLocker at XTS-AES 128-bit encryption.

  - **Yes** (*default*) - Enforce use of BitLocker.
  - **Not configured** - No BitLocker enforcement takes place.

- **BitLocker system drive policy**  
  [BitLocker Group Policy settings](/windows/security/information-protection/bitlocker/bitlocker-group-policy-settings)

  - **Configure** (*default*)

      This setting is available when *Startup authentication required* is set to *Yes*.

      - **Blocked** - Block the use of a PIN. 
      - **Required** - Require BitLocker have a PIN and TPM present to return success. For silent enable scenarios (including Autopilot) this setting can't be successful, as user interaction is required. It's recommended that PIN is disabled where silent enablement of BitLocker is required.
      - **Allowed** *(default)* - Enable BitLocker using the TPM if present, and allow a startup PIN be configured by the user.
      - **Not configured**

    - **Compatible TPM startup key**  
      CSP: [SystemDrivesRequireStartupAuthentication](/windows/client-management/mdm/bitlocker-csp#systemdrivesrequirestartupauthentication)
