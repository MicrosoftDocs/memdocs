# Microsoft Defender Advanced Threat Protection baseline settings for Intune

View the Microsoft Defender Advanced Threat Protection baseline settings that are supported by Microsoft Intune. The Advanced Threat Protection (ATP) baseline defaults represent the recommended configuration for ATP, and might not match baseline defaults for other security baselines.

The details in this article apply to version 3 of the Microsoft Defender ATP baseline, which released on March 1, 2020.

The Microsoft Defender Advanced Threat Protection baseline is available when your environment meets the prerequisites for using [Microsoft Defender Advanced Threat Protection](advanced-threat-protection.md#prerequisites).

This baseline is optimized for physical devices and is currently not recommended for use on virtual machines (VMs) or VDI endpoints. Certain baseline settings can impact remote interactive sessions on virtualized environments. For more information, see [Increase compliance to the Microsoft Defender ATP security baseline](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/security/threat-protection/microsoft-defender-atp/configure-machines-security-baseline) in the Windows documentation.

## Application Guard

For more information, see [WindowsDefenderApplicationGuard CSP](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/client-management/mdm/windowsdefenderapplicationguard-csp) in the Windows documentation.  

While using Microsoft Edge, Microsoft Defender Application Guard protects your environment from sites that aren't trusted by your organization. When users visit sites that aren't listed in your isolated network boundary, the sites open in a Hyper-V virtual browsing session. Trusted sites are defined by a network boundary.  

- **Turn on Application Guard for Edge (Options)**  
  CSP: [Settings/AllowWindowsDefenderApplicationGuard](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=872350)
  
  - **Enabled for Edge** (*default*) - Application Guard opens unapproved sites in a Hyper-V virtualized browsing container.
  - **Not configured** - Any site (trusted and untrusted) opens on the device, and not in a virtualized container.  
  
  When set to *Enable for Edge*, you can configure *Block external content from non-enterprise approved sites* and *Clipboard behavior*.

  - **Block external content from non-enterprise approved sites**  
    CSP: [Settings/BlockNonEnterpriseContent](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=872352)

    - **Yes** (*default*) - Block content from unapproved websites from loading.
    - **Not configured** - Non-enterprise sites can open on the device

  - **Clipboard behavior**  
    CSP: [Settings/ClipboardSettings](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=872351)

    Choose what copy and paste actions are allowed between the local PC and the Application Guard virtual browser. Options include:
    - **Not Configured**  
    - **Block copy and paste between PC and browser** (*default*) - Block both. Data can't transfer between the PC and the virtual browser.
    - **Allow copy and paste from browser to PC only** - Data can't transfer from the PC into the virtual browser.
    - **Allow copy and paste from PC to browser only** - Data can't transfer from the virtual browser to the host PC.
    - **Allow copy and paste between PC and browser** - No block for content exists.

- **Windows network isolation policy**  
  CSP: [Policy CSP - NetworkIsolation](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/client-management/mdm/policy-csp-networkisolation)

  Specify a list of *Network domains*, which are Enterprise resources that are hosted in the cloud that Application Guard treats as enterprise sites
  - **Configure** (*default*)
  - **Not configured**

  When set to *Configure* you can then define *Network domains*.

  - **Network domains**  
    Select **Add** and specify domains, IP address ranges, and network boundaries. By default, *securitycenter.windows.com* is configured.

## BitLocker

For more information, [BitLocker Group Policy settings](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/security/information-protection/bitlocker/bitlocker-group-policy-settings) in the Windows documentation.

- **Require storage cards to be encrypted (mobile only)**  
  CSP: [RequireStorageCardEncryption](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=872524)

  This setting only applies to Windows Mobile and Mobile Enterprise SKU devices.
