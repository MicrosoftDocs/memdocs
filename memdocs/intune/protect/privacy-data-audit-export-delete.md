# Audit, export, or delete personal data in Intune

Intune admins can use audit logs to track activities surrounding personal data. Admins can also export and delete personal data.

[!INCLUDE [GDPR-related guidance](../includes/gdpr-intro-sentence.md)]

## Audit personal data

Audit logs provide tenant admins with a record of activities that generate a change in Microsoft Intune. Audit logs are available for many manage activities and typically create, update (edit), delete, and assign actions. Remote tasks that generate audit events can also be reviewed. These audit logs might contain personal data from users whose devices are enrolled in Intune.  

For security purposes, Intune maintains audit logs for user and device actions for one year. These logs are automatically deleted after the one-year retention period.

To review audit logs, see [Audit logs for Intune activities](../fundamentals/monitor-audit-logs.md). 

Admins can't delete audit logs.

These audit events are retained for one year. Tenant admins can request audit logs using [this support request form](https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-US/privacy-questions?).

## Export personal data

Admins can export end user personal data, including accounts, service data, and associated logs to comply with Data Subject Rights Requests. You and your organization can decide whether to provide the data subject with a copy of their personal data or withhold it if you have a legitimate business reason. If you choose to provide it, you can give them a copy of the document, a redacted version, or a screenshot of the parts you want to share.

To export a user's personal data, you can use:

- the *Export* option on the *All devices* node of the Microsoft Intune admin center to export a list of devices. You can also copy device data directly.
- the [Export-IntuneData.ps1 script](https://aka.ms/intunedataexport).

## Delete end user personal data

There are three ways to remove personal data from Intune management:

- Delete the user from Microsoft Entra ID
- Reset the device to factory settings
- User self-removal

### Delete a user from Intune

To delete an end user's personal data from Intune, an admin must [delete the user from Microsoft Entra ID](/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/add-users-azure-active-directory#delete-a-user). When the user is deleted from Microsoft Entra ID (hard deleted), Intune receives the *Delete* signal from Microsoft Entra ID and then automatically begins purging all of that user's personal data from the Intune service. The user's information is deleted from Intune service within 30 days of the removal action.

### Reset device to factory settings

Resetting to factory settings restores all company and personal data and settings to the original factory settings. It's useful before providing a device to the next employee. User files, user installed applications, and non-default settings are removed and this data is deleted from the Intune service within 30 days of the removal action.

### User self-removal from Intune management

Users can remove their [Android](../user-help/unenroll-your-device-from-intune-android.md), [Apple](../user-help/unenroll-your-device-from-intune-ios.md), or [Windows](../user-help/unenroll-your-device-from-intune-windows.md) personal device from Intune management without admin assistance.

### Retire

The **Retire** action removes Intune provisioned data like company applications, data about apps that Intune is managing, policy settings, and email profiles that are provisioned through Intune. This action leaves the user's personal data on the device.

### BIOS passwords

If Intune has configured a BIOS password for the device as part of BIOS configuration management, the BIOS password will remain on the device until explicitly removed. BIOS passwords could be removed by editing the **BIOS configuration and other settings** policy, or locally on the device by changing the existing password.

### Delete a tenant from Microsoft Intune

If an Intune tenant customer cancels their Intune account, all tenant data is deleted within 180 days after the customer closes the Intune account. If the Microsoft Entra tenant is associated with other Microsoft enterprise subscriptions (Azure, Microsoft 365), then only the Intune Customer Data is deleted. The Microsoft Entra tenant resource is maintained for use by the other subscriptions. If the Intune account is the only subscription associated with the Microsoft Entra tenant, then the tenant is deleted and all resources and Customer Data are also deleted.
