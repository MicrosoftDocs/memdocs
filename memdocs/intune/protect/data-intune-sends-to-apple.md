# Data Intune sends to Apple

When any of the following Apple services are enabled on a device, Microsoft Intune establishes a connection with Apple and shares user and device information with Apple:

- [Apple Device Enrollment Program (DEP)](../enrollment/device-enrollment-program-enroll-ios.md)
- [Apple MDM Push certificate (APNS)](../enrollment/apple-mdm-push-certificate-get.md)
- [Apple School Manager (ASM)](/schooldatasync/apple-school-manager-integration-with-intune-for-education-and-school-data-sync)
- [Apple Volume Purchase Program (VPP)](../apps/vpp-apps-ios.md)

Before Microsoft Intune can establish a connection, you must create an Apple account for each of the Apple services.

The following table lists the data that Microsoft Intune sends from a device to the enabled Apple services.

The server should use this token to send push messages to the device. This check-in message also contains a PushMagic string. The server must remember this string and include it in any push messages it sends to the device. |
