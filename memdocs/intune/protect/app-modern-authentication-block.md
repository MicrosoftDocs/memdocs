# Block apps that don't use modern authentication (MSAL)

App-based Conditional Access with app protection policies rely on applications using [modern authentication](https://support.office.com/article/Using-Office-365-modern-authentication-with-Office-clients-776c0036-66fd-41cb-8928-5495c0f9168a), which is an implementation of OAuth2. Most current Office mobile and desktop applications use modern authentication. However, there are third-party apps and older Office apps that use other authentication methods, like basic authentication and forms-based authentication.

## Block access to apps

To block access to apps that don't use modern authentication, use Intune app protection policies to implement conditional access. For more information, see [App-based Conditional Access with Intune](app-based-conditional-access-intune.md).
