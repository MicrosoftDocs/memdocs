# Integrate MVISION Mobile with Intune

Complete the following steps to integrate the MVISION Mobile mobile threat defense solution with Intune.

## Before you begin

The following steps are done in the MVISION Mobile console <!-- Link pending --> and will enable a connection to MVISION Mobile's service for Intune enrolled devices (using device compliance) and unenrolled devices (using app protection policies).

Before starting the process of integrating MVISION Mobile with Intune, make sure you have the following subscription and credentials:

- Microsoft Intune subscription

- Azure Active Directory Global Administrator admin credentials to grant the following permissions:

  - Sign in and read user profile

  - Access the directory as the signed-in user

  - Read directory data

  - Send device information to Intune

- Admin credentials to access the MVISION Mobile console.

### MVISION Mobile app authorization

The MVISION Mobile app authorization process follows:

- Grant the MVISION Mobile service permissions to communicate information related to device health state back to Intune. To grant these permissions, you must use Global Administrator credentials. Granting permissions is a one-time operation. After the permissions are granted, the Global Administrator credentials aren't needed for day to day operation.

- MVISION Mobile syncs with Azure Active Directory (AD) Enrollment Group membership to populate its device's database.

- Allow MVISION Mobile admin console to use Azure AD Single Sign On (SSO).

- Allow the MVISION Mobile app to sign in using Azure AD SSO.

For more information about consent and Azure Active Directory applications, see [Request the permissions from a directory admin](/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-permissions-and-consent#request-the-permissions-from-a-directory-admin) in the Azure Active Directory article *Permissions and consent in the Azure Active Directory v2.0 endpoint*.


## To set up MVISION Mobile integration
***The actual console name, link, and following step details are pending***

1. Go to [MVISION Mobile console]() and sign in with your credentials. To perform the MVISION Mobile integration setup process, you must sign in with an Azure Active Directory user who has the Global Administrator role. This one-time setup operation uses the Global Administrator rights to grant permission in your organization for the MVISION Mobile apps to communicate with Intune.

2. Choose **Management** from the left menu.

3. Choose the **MDM settings** tab.

4. Choose **Add MDM,** then select **Microsoft Intune** from the **MDM provider** list.

5. After you set Microsoft Intune as the MDM service, the **Microsoft Intune Configuration** window pops up, choose the **Add Azure Active Directory** for each option: **MVISION Mobile console**, **MVISION Mobile iOS and Android apps** to authorize MVISION Mobile to communicate with Intune and Azure AD through Azure AD Single Sign-On.

    > [!IMPORTANT]  
    > You must add the console, and the MVISION Mobile iOS and Android apps to complete the integration process with Intune.

6. Choose **Accept** to authorize the MVISION Mobile app to communicate with Intune and Azure Active Directory.

7. After you add the console and MVISION Mobile iOS and Android apps to Azure AD, add the Azure AD security groups. This addition allows MVISION Mobile to synchronize the Azure AD security group with its service.

8. Choose **Finish** to save the configuration and start the first Azure AD security group synchronization.

9. Sign out of the MVISION Mobile MTD console.
