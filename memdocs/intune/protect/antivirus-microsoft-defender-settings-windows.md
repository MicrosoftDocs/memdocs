# Settings for Microsoft Defender Antivirus policy in Microsoft Intune for Windows devices

View details about the [endpoint security](../protect/endpoint-security-policy.md) antivirus policy settings you can configure for the Microsoft Defender Antivirus profile for Windows 10 and later in Microsoft Intune.

> [!NOTE]  
> This article details the settings you can find in Microsoft Defender Antivirus and Microsoft Defender Antivirus Exclusions profiles created before April 5, 2022, for the *Windows 10 and later* platform for endpoint security Antivirus policy. On April 5, 2022, the *Windows 10 and later* platform was replaced by the *Windows 10, Windows 11, and Windows Server* platform. Profiles created after that date use a new settings format as found in the Settings Catalog. With this change you can no longer create new versions of the old profile and they are no longer being developed. Although you can no longer create new instances of the older profile, you can continue to edit and use instances of it that you previously created.
>
> For profiles that use the new settings format, Intune no longer maintains a list of each setting by name. Instead, the name of each setting, its configuration options, and its explanatory text you see in the Microsoft Intune admin center are taken directly from the settings authoritative content. That content can provide more information about the use of the setting in its proper context. When viewing a settings information text, you can use its *Learn more* link to open that content.
>
> The following settings details for Windows profiles apply to those deprecated profiles.

## Cloud protection

- **Turn on cloud-delivered protection**  
  CSP: [AllowCloudProtection](/windows/client-management/mdm/policy-csp-defender#defender-allowcloudprotection)

  By default, Defender on Windows 10/11 desktop devices sends information to Microsoft about any problems it finds. Microsoft analyzes that information to learn more about problems affecting you and other customers, to offer improved solutions.

  - **Not configured** (*default*) - The setting is restored to the system default.
  - **No** - The setting is disabled. Device users can't change this setting.
  - **Yes** - Cloud-delivered protection is turned on.  Device users can't change this setting.

- **Cloud-delivered protection level**  
  CSP: [CloudBlockLevel](/windows/client-management/mdm/policy-csp-defender#defender-cloudblocklevel)

  Configure how aggressive Defender Antivirus is in blocking and scanning suspicious files.
  - **Not configured** (*default*) - Default Defender blocking level.
  - **High** - Aggressively block unknowns while optimizing client performance, which includes a greater chance of false positives.
  - **High plus** - Aggressively block unknowns and apply additional protection measures that might affect client performance.

- **Defender cloud extended timeout in seconds**  
  CSP: [CloudExtendedTimeout](/windows/client-management/mdm/policy-csp-defender#defender-cloudextendedtimeout)

  Defender Antivirus automatically blocks suspicious files for 10 seconds while it scans them in the cloud to make sure they're safe. You can add up to 50 additional seconds to this timeout.

## Microsoft Defender Antivirus Exclusions

> [!WARNING]
> **Defining exclusions lowers the protection offered by Microsoft Defender Antivirus**. Always evaluate the risks that are associated with implementing exclusions. Only exclude files you know aren't malicious.
