# Learn about Conditional Access and Intune

With Conditional Access, you can control the devices and apps that can connect to your email and company resources. 

Enterprise Mobility + Security (EMS)  is not a standalone product. It's a solution that takes part on all services and products that are part of EMS. Conditional Access provides granular access control to keep your corporate data secure, while giving users an experience that allows them to do their best work from any device, and from any location.

You can define conditions that gate access to your corporate data based on location, device, user state, and application sensitivity.

> [!NOTE]
> Conditional Access also extends its capabilities to [Microsoft 365 services](/office365/enterprise/office-365-client-support-conditional-access).
