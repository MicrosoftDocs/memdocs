# Integrate Jamf Pro with Intune for compliance

When your organization uses [Jamf Pro](https://www.jamf.com) to manage macOS devices, you can use Microsoft Intune compliance policies with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) Conditional Access to ensure devices in your organization are compliant before they can access company resources. To integrate Jamf Pro with Intune, you have two options:

- **Manually configure integration** - Use the information in this article to manually configure Jamf integration with Intune.
- **Use the Jamf Cloud Connector** (*recommended*) - Use the information in [Use the Jamf Cloud Connector with Microsoft Intune](../protect/conditional-access-jamf-cloud-connector.md) to install the Jamf Cloud Connector to integrate Jamf Pro with Microsoft Intune. The Cloud Connector automates many of the steps that are required when you manually configure integration.


When Jamf Pro integrates with Intune, you can sync the inventory data from macOS devices with Intune, through Azure AD. Intune's compliance engine then analyzes the inventory data to generate a report. Intune's analysis is combined with intelligence about the device user's Azure AD identity to drive enforcement through Conditional Access. Devices that are compliant with the Conditional Access policies can gain access to protected company resources.

After you configure integration, you'll then [configure Jamf and Intune to enforce compliance with Conditional Access](conditional-access-assign-jamf.md) on devices managed by Jamf.

## Prerequisites

### Products and services

You need the following to configure Conditional Access with Jamf Pro:

- Jamf Pro 10.1.0 or later
- Microsoft Intune and Microsoft AAD Premium P1 licenses (recommended Microsoft Enterprise Mobility + Security license bundle)
- A user with Microsoft Intune Integration privileges in Jamf Pro
- [Company Portal app for macOS](https://aka.ms/macoscompanyportal)
- macOS devices with OS X 10.12 Yosemite or later

### Network ports

<!-- source: https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4519171/troubleshoot-problems-when-integrating-jamf-with-microsoft-intune -->
The following ports should be accessible for Jamf and Intune to integrate correctly:

- **Intune**: Port 443
- **Apple**: Ports 2195, 2196, and 5223 (push notifications to Intune)
- **Jamf**: Ports 80 and 5223

To allow APNS to function correctly on the network, you must also enable outgoing connections to, and redirects from:

- the Apple 17.0.0.0/8 block over TCP ports 5223 and 443 from all client networks.
- ports 2195 and 2196 from Jamf Pro servers.  

For more information about these ports, see the following articles:

- [Intune network configuration requirements and bandwidth](../fundamentals/network-bandwidth-use.md).
- [Network Ports Used by Jamf Pro](https://www.jamf.com/jamf-nation/articles/34/network-ports-used-by-jamf-pro) on jamf.com.
- [TCP and UDP ports used by Apple software products](https://support.apple.com/HT202944) on support.apple.com

## Connect Intune to Jamf Pro

To connect Intune with Jamf Pro:

1. Create a new application in Azure.
2. Enable Intune to integrate with Jamf Pro.
3. Configure Conditional Access in Jamf Pro.

### Create an application in Azure Active Directory

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), go to **Azure Active Directory** > **App Registrations**, and then select **New registration**.

2. On the **Register an application** page, specify the following details:

   - In the **Name** section, enter a meaningful application name, for example **Jamf Conditional Access**.
   - For the **Supported account types** section, select **Accounts in any organizational directory**.
   - For **Redirect URI**, leave the default of Web, and then specify the URL for your Jamf Pro instance.

3. Select **Register** to create the application and to open the **Overview** page for the new app.

4. On the app **Overview** page, copy the **Application (client) ID** value and record it for later use. You'll need this value in later procedures.

5. Select **Certificates & secrets** under **Manage**. Select the **New client secret** button. Enter a value in **Description**, select any option for **Expires** and choose **Add**.

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > Before you leave this page, copy the value for the client secret and record it for later use. You will need this value in later procedures. This value isn't available again, without recreating the app registration.

6. Select **API permissions** under **Manage**. 

7. On the API permissions page, remove all permissions from this app by selecting the **...** icon next to each existing permission. Note that this is required; the integration will not succeed if there are any unexpected extra permissions in this app registration.

8. Next, we will add permissions to update device attributes. At the top left of the **API permissions** page, select **Add a permission** to add a new permission. 

9. On the **Request API permissions** page, select **Intune**, and then select **Application permissions**. Select only the check box for **update_device_attributes** and save the new permission.

10. Next, grant admin consent for this app by selecting **Grant admin consent for _\<your tenant>_** in the top left of the **API permissions** page. You may need to re-authenticate your account in the new window and grant the application access by following the prompts.  

11. Refresh the page by click on the **Refresh** button at the top of the page. Confirm that admin consent has been granted for the **update_device_attributes** permission. 

12. After the app is registered successfully, the API permissions should only contain one permission called **update_device_attributes** and should appear as follows:

   ![Successful permissions](./media/conditional-access-integrate-jamf/sucessfull-app-registration.png)

The app registration process in Azure AD is complete.

> [!NOTE]
> If the client secret expires, you must create a new client secret in Azure and then update the Conditional Access data in Jamf Pro. Azure allows you to have both the old secret and new key active to prevent service disruptions.

### Enable Intune to integrate with Jamf Pro

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431).

2. Select **Tenant administration** > **Connectors and tokens** > **Partner device management**.

3. Enable the *Compliance Connector for Jamf* by pasting the Application ID you saved during the previous procedure into the **Specify the Azure Active Directory App ID for Jamf** field.

4. Select **Save**.

### Configure Microsoft Intune Integration in Jamf Pro

1. Activate the connection in the Jamf Pro console:

   1. Open the Jamf Pro console and navigate to **Global Management** > **Conditional Access**. Click the **Edit** button on the **macOS Intune Integration** tab.
   2. Select the check box for **Enable Intune Integration for macOS**.
   3. Provide the required information about your Azure tenant, including **Location**, **Domain name**, the **Application ID**, and the value for the *client secret* that you saved when you created the app in Azure AD.
   4. Select **Save**. Jamf Pro tests your settings and verifies your success.

   Return to the **Partner device management** page in Intune to complete the configuration.

2. In Intune, go to the **Partner device management** page. Under **Connector Settings** configure groups for assignment:

   - Select **Include** and specify which User groups you want to target for macOS enrollment with Jamf.
   - Use **Exclude** to select groups of Users that won't enroll with Jamf and instead will enroll their Macs directly with Intune.

   *Exclude* overrides *Include*, which means any device that is in both groups is excluded from Jamf and directed to enroll with Intune.

   >[!NOTE]
   > This method of including and excluding user groups affects the enrollment experience of the user. Any user with a Mac thats already enrolled in either Jamf or Intune who is then targeted to enroll with the other MDM must unenroll their device and then re-enroll it with the new MDM before management of the device works properly.

3. Select **Evaluate** to determine how many devices will be enrolled with Jamf, based on your group configurations.

4. Select **Save** when you're ready to apply the configuration.

5. To proceed, you will next need to use [Jamf to deploy the Company Portal for Mac](conditional-access-assign-jamf.md#deploy-the-company-portal-app-for-macos-in-jamf-pro) so that users can register their devices to Intune.

## Set up compliance policies and register devices

After you configure integration between Intune and Jamf, you need to [apply compliance policies to Jamf-managed devices](conditional-access-assign-jamf.md).

## Disconnect Jamf Pro and Intune

Should you need to remove integration of Jamf Pro with Intune, use the following steps to remove the connection from within the Jamf Pro console.This information applies to both the a manually configured integration, as well as integration by using the Cloud Connector.

1. In Jamf Pro, go to **Global Management** > **Conditional Access**. On the **macOS Intune Integration** tab, select **Edit**.

2. Clear the **Enable Intune Integration for macOS** check box.

3. Select **Save**. Jamf Pro sends your configuration to Intune and the integration will be terminated.

4. Sign in to the [Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431).

5. Select **Tenant administration** > **Connectors and tokens** > **Partner device management** to verify that the status is now **Terminated**.

   > [!NOTE]
   > Your organization's Mac devices will be removed at the date (3 months) shown in your console.
