# Certificate Connector for Microsoft Intune

For Microsoft Intune to support use of certificates for authentication and the signing and encryption of email using S/MIME, you can use the Certificate Connector for Microsoft Intune. The certificate connector is software you install on an on-premises server to help deliver and manage certificates for your Intune-managed devices.

This article introduces the Certificate Connector for Microsoft Intune, its lifecycle, and how to keep it up to date.

> [!TIP]
> Beginning on July 29, 2021, the **Certificate Connector for Microsoft Intune** replaces the use of *PFX Certificate Connector for Microsoft Intune* and *Microsoft Intune Connector*. The new connector includes the functionality of both previous connectors. With the release of version 6.2109.51.0 of the Certificate Connector for Microsoft, the previous connectors are no longer supported.

## Connector overview

To use the certificate connector, you’ll first download software from within the Microsoft Intune admin center, which you’ll then install on a Windows Server.

During the installation, you can install one or more connector features, including support for:

- Private and public key pair (PKCS) certificates
- PKCS imported certificates
- Simple Certificate Enrollment Protocol (SCEP)
- Certificate revocation

You'll also assign a service account to run the connector. This account is used for all interactions with your Certification Authority, and for certificate issuance, revocation, and renewal. Supported options for the service account include the connector servers SYSTEM account or a Domain account.

After the connector installs, you can run configuration of the connector again at any time to update it or change the features you’ve installed. After it's installed and configured, the connector can automatically install future updates to keep your connectors current to the most recent release.

Intune supports installing of multiple instances of the connector in a tenant, and each instance can support different features. If you use multiple connectors that support different features, certificate requests are always routed to a relevant connector. For example, if you install two connectors that support PKCS, and install two more that support both PKCS and SCEP, certificate tasks for PKCS can be managed by any of the four connectors, but tasks for SCEP are only directed to the two connectors that support SCEP.
  
Each instance of the certificate connector has the same network requirements as devices that are managed by Intune. For more information, see [Network endpoints for Microsoft Intune](../fundamentals/intune-endpoints.md), and [Intune network configuration requirements and bandwidth](../fundamentals/network-bandwidth-use.md).

## Capabilities of the certificate connector

The Certificate Connector for Microsoft Intune supports:

- PKCS #12 certificate requests.

- PKCS imported certificates (PFX file) for S/MIME email encryption for a specific user.

- Issuing Simple Certificate Enrollment Protocol (SCEP) certificates. When you use an Active Directory Certificate Services Certification Authority (CA), also called a *Microsoft CA*, you must also configure the Network Device Enrollment Service (NDES) on the server that hosts the connector.

  Use of SCEP with a third-party Certification Authority, doesn’t require use of the Certificate Connector for Microsoft Intune.

- Certificate revocation.

- [Automatic updates](#automatic-update) to new versions. When servers that host the certificate connector can access the internet, they automatically install new updates to stay current. When a connector fails to automatically update, you can manually update the connector.

- Installation of up to 100 instances of the connector per Intune tenant, with each instance on a separate Windows Server. When you use multiple connectors:
  - Each instance of the connector must have access to the private key used to encrypt the passwords of each uploaded PFX file.
  - Each instance of the connector should be at the same version. Because the connector supports automatic updates to the newest version, updates can be managed for you by Intune.  
  - Your infrastructure supports redundancy and load balancing, as any available connector instance that supports the same connector features can process your certificate requests.
  - You can configure a proxy to allow the connector to communicate with Intune.
  - Certificate Connector should not be installed on the same server as Intune Connector for Active Directory.

    >[!NOTE]
    > Any instance of the connector that supports PKCS can be used to retrieve pending PKCS requests from the Intune Service queue, process Imported certificates, and handle revocation requests. It's not possible to define which connector handles each request. </br></br>
    > Therefore, each connector that supports PKCS must have the same permissions and be able to connect with all the certification authorities defined later in the PKCS profiles.

## Lifecycle

Periodically, updates  to the certificate connector are released. Announcements for new connector updates, including the version and release date for each update, appear in the [What's new for the Certificate Connector](#whats-new-for-the-certificate-connector) section in this article.

**Each new connector release**:

- Is supported for six months after the release of a new version. During this period, automatic updates can install a newer connector version. Updated connector versions can include but aren't limited to bug fixes and performance and feature improvements.

- If an out of support connector fails, you’ll need to update to the latest supported version.

- If you block the automatic update of the connector, plan to manually update the connector within six months, before support for the installed version ends. After support ends, you’ll need to update the connector to a version that remains in support to receive support for problems with the connector.

- Connectors that are out of support will continue to function for up to 18 months after the release of a new version. After 18 months, a connectors functionality might fail due to service level improvements, updates, or in addressing common security vulnerabilities that might surface in the future.

For example, when the connector version 6.2203.12.0 that released on May 4, 2022, the connector previous version 6.2202.38.0 will drop from support on November 4, 2022. The connector previous version should continue to function (though not be supported) until November 2023. After November 2023 the connector previous version might stop communicating with Intune.

### Automatic update

Intune can automatically update the connector to the latest version shortly after that connector version is released.

To update automatically, the server that hosts the connector must access the **Azure update service**:

- Port: **443**
- Endpoint: **autoupdate.msappproxy.net**

When firewalls, infrastructure, or network configurations limit access for automatic update, resolve the blocking issues or manually update the connector to the new version.

### Manual update

The process to manually update a certificate connector is the same for reinstalling a connector.

You can manually update a certificate connector even when it supports automatic updates. For example, you can manually update the connector when your network configuration blocks an automatic update.

### Reinstall a certificate connector

1. On the Windows Server that hosts the connector, run the connector installation program to uninstall the connector.

2. To install the new version, use the procedure to install a new version of the connector. Be sure to check for any new or updated [prerequisites](../protect/certificate-connector-prerequisites.md) when installing a newer version of a connector.

## Connector status

In the Microsoft Intune admin center, you can select a certificate connector to view information about its status:

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431)

2. Go to **Tenant administration** > **Connectors and tokens** > **Certificate connectors**.

3. Select a connector to view its status.

When viewing the connector status:

- Deprecated connectors show a **Warning**. After the six-month grace period, the warning changes to an Error.
- Connectors that are beyond the grace period show an Error. These connectors are no longer supported and can stop working at any time.

## Logging

Logs for the Certificate Connector for Microsoft Intune are available as Event logs on the server where the connector is installed:

- **Event Viewer** > **Application and Service Logs** > **Microsoft** > **Intune** > **Certificate Connectors**

The following logs are available and default to 50 MB, and have automatic archiving enabled:

- **Admin Log** - This log contains one log event per request to the connector. Events include either a *success* with information about the request, or an *error* with information about the request and the error.
- **Operational Log** - This log displays additional information to that found in the Admin log, and can be of use in debugging issues. This log also displays ongoing operations instead of single events.

In addition to the default log level, you can enable debug logging for each log to obtain more details.
### Event IDs

All events have one of the following IDs:

- **0001-0999** - Not associated with any specific scenario
- **1000-1999** - PKCS
- **2000-2999** - PKCS Import
- **3000-3999** - Revoke
- **4000-4999** - SCEP
