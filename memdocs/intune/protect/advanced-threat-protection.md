# Enforce compliance for Microsoft Defender for Endpoint with Conditional Access in Intune

You can integrate Microsoft Defender for Endpoint with Microsoft Intune as a Mobile Threat Defense solution. Integration can help you prevent security breaches and limit the impact of breaches within an organization.

Microsoft Defender for Endpoint works with devices that run:
- Android
- iOS/iPadOS
- Windows 10 or later

To be successful, you'll use the following configurations in concert:

- **Establish a service-to-service connection between Intune and Microsoft Defender for Endpoint**. This connection lets Microsoft Defender for Endpoint collect data about machine risk from supported devices you manage with Intune.
- **Use a device configuration profile to onboard devices with Microsoft Defender for Endpoint**. You onboard devices to configure them to communicate with Microsoft Defender for Endpoint and to provide data that helps assess their risk level.
- **Use a device compliance policy to set the level of risk you want to allow**. Risk levels are reported by Microsoft Defender for Endpoint. Devices that exceed the allowed risk level are identified as noncompliant.
- **Use a conditional access policy** to block users from accessing corporate resources from devices that are noncompliant.

When you integrate Intune with Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, you can take advantage of Microsoft Defender for Endpoints Threat & Vulnerability Management (TVM) and [use Intune to remediate endpoint weakness identified by TVM](atp-manage-vulnerabilities.md).

## Example of using Microsoft Defender for Endpoint with Intune

The following example helps explain how these solutions work together to help protect your organization. For this example, Microsoft Defender for Endpoint and Intune are already integrated.

Consider an event where someone sends a Word attachment with embedded malicious code to a user within your organization.

- The user opens the attachment, and enables the content.
- An elevated privilege attack starts, and an attacker from a remote machine has admin rights to the victim's device.
- The attacker then remotely accesses the user's other devices. This security breach can impact the entire organization.

Microsoft Defender for Endpoint can help resolve security events like this scenario.

- In our example, Microsoft Defender for Endpoint detects that the device executed abnormal code, experienced a process privilege escalation, injected malicious code, and issued a suspicious remote shell.
- Based on these actions from the device, Microsoft Defender for Endpoint [classifies the device as high-risk](/windows/security/threat-protection/microsoft-defender-atp/alerts-queue#severity) and includes a detailed report of suspicious activity in the Microsoft Defender Security Center portal.

You can integrate Microsoft Defender for Endpoint with Microsoft Intune as a Mobile Threat Defense solution. Integration can help you prevent security breaches and limit the impact of breaches within an organization.

Because you have an Intune device compliance policy to classify devices with a *Medium* or *High* level of risk as noncompliant, the compromised device is classified as noncompliant. This classification allows your conditional access policy to kick in and block access from that device to your corporate resources.

For devices that run Android, you can use Intune policy to modify the configuration of Microsoft Defender for Endpoint on Android. For more information, see [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint web protection](../protect/advanced-threat-protection-manage-android.md).
