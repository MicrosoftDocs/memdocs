# Configure tenant attach to support endpoint security policies from Intune

When you use the Configuration Manager tenant attach scenario, you can deploy endpoint security policies from Intune to devices you manage with Configuration Manager. To use this scenario, you must first configure tenant attach for Configuration Manager and enable collections of devices from Configuration Manager for use with Intune. After collections are enabled for use, you use the Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center to create and deploy policies.

## Requirements to use Intune policy for tenant attach

To support using Intune endpoint security policies with Configuration Manager devices, your Configuration Manager environment requires the following configurations. [Configuration guidance](#set-up-configuration-manager-to-support-intune-policies) is provided in this article:

### General requirements for tenant attach

- **Configure tenant attach** - With the *tenant attach* scenario, you synchronize devices from Configuration Manager to the Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center. You can then use the admin center to deploy supported policies to those collections.

  Tenant attach is often configured with co-management, but you can configure tenant attach on its own.

- **Synchronize Configuration Manager devices and collections** – After you configure tenant attach, you can select the Configuration Manager devices to synchronize with Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center. You can also return later to modify the devices you sync.

  After selecting devices to synchronize, you must *enable* collections for use with endpoint security policies from Intune. Supported policies for Configuration Manager devices can only be assigned to collections you’ve *enabled*.

- **Permissions to Azure AD** - To complete setup of tenant attach, you’ll need an account with Global Administrator permissions to your Azure subscription.

- **Tenant for Microsoft Defender for Endpoint** – Your Microsoft Defender for Endpoint tenant must be integrated with your Microsoft Endpoint Manager tenant (Intune subscription).  See [Use Microsoft Defender for Endpoint](advanced-threat-protection.md) in the Intune documentation.

### Configuration Manager version requirements for Intune endpoint security policies

[!INCLUDE [endpoint detection and response policy prerequisites](../includes/tenant-attach-edr-prerequisites.md)]

[!INCLUDE [Firewall policy prerequisites](../includes/tenant-attach-firewall-prerequisites.md)]

## Set up Configuration Manager to support Intune policies

Before you deploy Intune policies to Configuration Manager devices, complete the configurations detailed in the following sections. These configurations onboard your Configuration Manager devices with Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, and enable them to work with the Intune policies.

The following tasks are completed in the Configuration Manager console. If you’re not familiar with Configuration Manager, work with a Configuration Manager admin to complete these tasks.

1. [Confirm your Configuration Manager environment](#task-1-confirm-your-configuration-manager-environment)
2. [Configure tenant attach and synchronize devices](#task-2-configure-tenant-attach-and-synchronize-devices)
4. [Select devices to synchronize](#task-3-select-devices-to-synchronize)
5. [Enable collections for endpoint security policies](#task-4-enable-collections-for-endpoint-security-policies)

> [!TIP]
> To learn more about using Microsoft Defender for Endpoint with Configuration Manager, see the following articles in the Configuration Manager content:
>
> - [Onboard Configuration Manager clients to Microsoft Defender for Endpoint via the Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center](../../configmgr/core/get-started/2020/technical-preview-2003.md#bkmk_atp)
> - [Microsoft Endpoint Manager tenant attach: Device sync and device actions](../../configmgr/core/get-started/2020/technical-preview-2002-2.md#bkmk_attach)

### Task 1: Confirm your Configuration Manager environment

Intune policies for Configuration Manager devices require different minimum versions of Configuration Manager, depending on when the policy was first released. Review the [Configuration Manager version requirements for Intune endpoint security policies](#configuration-manager-version-requirements-for-intune-endpoint-security-policies) found earlier in this article to ensure your environment supports the policies you plan to use. A more recent version of Configuration Manager will support policies that require an earlier version.

When a Configuration Manager hotfix is necessary, you can find the hotfix as an in-console update for Configuration Manager. For more information see [Install in-console updates](../../configmgr/core/servers/manage/install-in-console-updates.md) in the Configuration Manager documentation.

After installing necessary updates, return here to continue configuring your environment to support endpoint security policies from the Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center.

### Task 2: Configure tenant attach and synchronize devices

With Tenant attach you specify collections of devices from your Configuration Manager deployment to synchronize with the Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center. After collections synchronize, use the admin center to view information about those devices and to deploy endpoint security policy from Intune to them.

For more information about the tenant attach scenario, see [Enable tenant attach](../../configmgr/tenant-attach/device-sync-actions.md) in the Configuration Manager content.

#### Enable tenant attach when co-management hasn’t been enabled

> [!TIP]
> You use the **Co-management Configuration Wizard** in the Configuration Manager console to enable tenant attach, but you don’t need to enable co-management.
>
> If you plan to enable co-management, be familiar with co-management, its prerequisites, and how to manage workloads before you continue. See [What is co-management?](../../configmgr/comanage/overview.md) in the Configuration Manager documentation.

1. In the Configuration Manager admin console, go to **Administration** > **Overview** > **Cloud Services** > **Co-management**.
2. In the ribbon, click **Configure co-management** to open the wizard.
3. On the **Tenant onboarding** page, select **AzurePublicCloud** for your environment. Azure Government cloud isn't supported.
   1. Click **Sign In**. Use your *Global Administrator* account to sign in.

   2. Ensure the option **Upload to Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center** is selected on the **Tenant onboarding** page.

   3. Remove the check from **Enable automatic client enrollment for co-management**.

      When this option is selected, the Wizard presents additional pages to complete the setup of co-management. For more information, see [Enable co-management](../../configmgr/comanage/how-to-enable.md) in the Configuration Manager content.

4. Click **Next** and then **Yes** to accept the **Create AAD Application** notification. This action provisions a service principal and creates an Azure AD application registration to facilitate the sync of collections to the Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center.

5. On the **Configure upload** page, configure which collections of devices you want to sync.
   You can limit your configuration to device collections or use the recommended device upload setting for **All my devices managed by Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager**.

   > [!TIP]
   > You can skip selecting collections now, and later use the information in the following task, Task 3,  to configure which collections of devices to synchronize with the Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center.

6. Click **Summary** to review your selection, then click **Next**.

7. When the wizard is complete, click **Close**.

   Tenant attach is now configured, and selected devices sync to Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center.

#### Enable tenant attach when you already use co-management

1. In the Configuration Manager admin console, go to **Administration** > **Overview** > **Cloud Services** > **Co-management**.

2. Right-click your co-management settings and select **Properties**.

3. In the **Configure upload** tab, select **Upload to Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center**. Click **Apply**.

   The default setting for device upload is **All my devices managed by Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager**. You can also choose to limit your configuration to one or few device collections.

   ![View the co-management properties tab](./media/tenant-attach-intune/configure-upload.png)

4. Sign in with your *Global Administrator* account when prompted.

5. Click **Yes** to accept the **Create AAD Application** notification. This action provisions a service principal and creates an Azure AD application registration to facilitate the sync.

6. Click **OK** to exit the co-management properties if you're done making changes. Otherwise move to Task 3 to selectively enable device upload to the Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center.

   Tenant attach is now configured, and selected devices sync to Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center.

### Task 3: Select devices to synchronize

When tenant attach is configured, you can select devices to sync. If you haven't already synchronized devices or need to reconfigure which ones you do sync, you can edit the properties of co-management in the Configuration Manager console to do so.

#### Select devices to upload

1. In the Configuration Manager admin console, go to **Administration** > **Overview** > **Cloud Services** > **Co-management**.

2. Right-click your co-management settings and select **Properties**.

3. In the **Configure upload** tab, select **Upload to Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center**. Click **Apply**.

   The default setting for device upload is **All my devices managed by Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager**. You can also choose to limit your configuration to one or few device collections.

### Task 4: Enable collections for endpoint security policies

After you configure devices to sync to Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center, you must enable collections to work with endpoint security policies. When you enable collections of devices to work with endpoint security policies from Intune, you're making the configured collections available to be targeted with endpoint security policies.

#### Enable collections for use with endpoint security policies
