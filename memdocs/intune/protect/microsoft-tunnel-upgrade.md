# Upgrade Microsoft Tunnel for Microsoft Intune

Microsoft Tunnel, a VPN gateway solution for Microsoft Intune, periodically receives [software upgrades](#microsoft-tunnel-update-history), which must install on the tunnel servers to keep them in support. To stay in support, servers must run the most recent release, or at most be one version behind. The information in this article explains the upgrade process, upgrade controls, and status reports you use to understand the software version of tunnel servers, when upgrades are available, and how to control when upgrades happen.

Intune handles the upgrade of servers assigned to each tunnel site for you. When upgrades for  site begin, all servers in the site will upgrade one at a time, which is referred to as an upgrade cycle. While a server is upgrading, the Microsoft Tunnel on the server isn't available for use. Upgrading a single server at a time helps minimize disruptions to users when the site includes multiple servers.  

During an upgrade cycle:

- Intune begins by upgrading one server in the site. The upgrade can start as soon as 10 minutes after the release becomes available.
- If a server was off, upgrade begins after the server turns on.
- After a successful upgrade of one server at a site, Intune waits a short time before it starts the upgrade of the next server.

## Use upgrade controls

To help control when Intune begins the upgrade cycle, configure the following settings at each site. You can configure the settings when [creating a new site](../protect/microsoft-tunnel-configure.md#create-a-site), or by editing the properties of an existing site:

- **Automatically upgrade servers at this site**
- **Limit server upgrades to maintenance window**

### Automatically upgrade servers at this site

This setting determines if an upgrade cycle for the site can begin automatically, or if an admin must explicitly approve the upgrade before the cycle can begin.

- **Yes** *(default)* – When set to *Yes*, the site automatically upgrade servers as soon as possible after a new tunnel version becomes available. Upgrades begin without admin intervention.

  If you set a maintenance window for the site, the upgrade cycle begins between the windows start and end time. When no maintenance window is set, the upgrade cycle starts as soon as possible.

- **No** – When set to *No*, Intune won’t upgrade servers until an admin explicitly chooses to begin the upgrade cycle.

  After upgrade is approved for a site with a maintenance window, the upgrade cycle begins between the windows start and end time. If there's no maintenance window, the upgrade cycle starts as soon as possible.

  > [!IMPORTANT]  
  > When you configure site for manual upgrades, periodically review the [Health check](#view-tunnel-server-status) tab to understand when newer versions of Microsoft Tunnel are available to install. The report also identifies when the current tunnel version at the site is out of support.

### Limit server upgrades to maintenance window

Use this setting to define a maintenance window for the site.

When configured for site, the server upgrade cycle can begin only during the configured period. However, once begun, the cycle continues to update servers one-by-one until all servers assigned to the site complete the upgrade.

- **No** *(default)* – No maintenance window is set. Sites configured to upgrade automatically will do so as soon as possible. Sites configured to require explicit action to start the upgrade will do so as soon as possible *after* the upgrade is approved.

- **Yes** – Set a maintenance window. The window limits when a server upgrade cycle can begin at the site. The maintenance window doesn’t define when individual servers assigned to the site might start to upgrade.

  Sites configured to upgrade automatically will start the upgrade cycle only during the configured period. Sites configured to require the admin to approve the upgrade before beginning, will do during the next maintenance window *after* the upgrade is approved.

  When set to *Yes*, configure the following options:

  - **Time zone** – The time zone you select determines when the maintenance window starts and ends on all servers in the site. The time zone of individual servers isn't used.
  - **Start time** – Specify the earliest time that the upgrade cycle can start, based on the time zone you selected.
  - **End time** - Specify the latest time that upgrade cycle can start, based on the time zone you selected. Upgrade cycles that start before this time will continue to run and can complete after this time.

## View tunnel server status

You can view information about the status of Microsoft Tunnel servers, including the version of Microsoft Tunnel on a server.

For sites that don't support automatic upgrade, you can also view when upgrades to a new version are available.

Sign in to [Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431) > **Tenant administration** > **Microsoft Tunnel Gateway** > **Health status**.  Select a server and then open the **Health check** tab to view the following information about it:

- **Server version** - The status of the Tunnel Gateway Server software, in the context of the most recent version available.

  - **Healthy** - Up to date with the most recent software version. 
  - **Warning** - One version behind.
  - **Unhealthy** - Two or more versions behind, and out of support.

When a server doesn’t run the most recent software version, plan to install an available upgrade to keep the Microsoft Tunnel in support.

## Approve upgrades

Sites that have the setting *Automatically upgrade servers at this site* set to *No* won't automatically upgrade servers. Instead, an admin must approve upgrades for servers at that site before the upgrade cycle starts.

To understand when an upgrade is available for servers, use the [Health check](#view-tunnel-server-status) tab to review server status.
### To approve an upgrade

1. Sign in to [Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431) > **Tenant administration** > **Microsoft Tunnel Gateway** > **Sites**.

2. Select the site with an **Upgrade type** of **Manual**.

3. On the site’s properties, select **Upgrade servers**.

After you choose to upgrade servers, Intune starts the process to do so, which cannot be canceled. The time that upgrades begin at the site depends on the configuration of maintenance windows for the site.

<!-- ## Manage upgrades

Upgrade installation depends on how a site is configured.

### Sites that support automatic upgrade

When a site [supports automatic upgrades](#automatically-upgrade-servers-at-this-site) of servers, no administrative action is necessary. When the upgrade starts depends on the configuration of a maintenance window for the site:

- **Without a maintenance window**: Upgrade start as soon as possible after a new version of Microsoft Tunnel becomes available.

- **With a maintenance window**: Upgrades start during the next maintenance window after a new version of Microsoft Tunnel becomes available.

### Sites that don't support automatic upgrade

When a site [doesn’t support automatic upgrade](#automatically-upgrade-servers-at-this-site), new versions of Microsoft Tunnel must be explicitly approved for the site before servers will upgrade.

Use the [Health check](#view-tunnel-server-status) tab to understand when newer versions of Microsoft Tunnel are available to install. The report also identifies when the current tunnel version at the site is out of support.

#### To approve installation of an upgrade

1. Sign in to [Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431) > **Tenant administration** > **Microsoft Tunnel Gateway** > **Sites**.

2. Select the site with an **Upgrade type** of **Manual**.

3. On the site’s properties, select **Upgrade servers**.

After you choose to upgrade servers, Intune starts the process to do so, which cannot be canceled. The time that upgrades begin at the site depends on the configuration of maintenance windows for the site.

## Microsoft Tunnel update history

Updates for the Microsoft Tunnel release periodically. When a new version is available, read about the changes here.

After an update releases, it rolls out to tenants over the following days. This rollout time means new updates might not be available for your tunnel servers for a few days.

The Microsoft Tunnel version for a server isn’t available in the Intune UI at this time. Instead, run the following command on the Linux server that hosts the tunnel to identify the hash values of  *agentImageDigest* and *serverImageDiegest*: `cat /etc/mstunnel/images_configured`
