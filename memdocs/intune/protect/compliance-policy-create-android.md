# Device Compliance settings for Android device administrator in Intune

This article lists the compliance settings you can configure on Android device administrator devices in Intune. As part of your mobile device management (MDM) solution, use these settings to mark rooted devices as not compliant, set an allowed threat level, enable Google Play Protect, and more.

For assistance in configuring compliance policy, see [Use compliance policies to set rules for devices you manage with Intune](../protect/device-compliance-get-started.md).

This feature applies to:

- Android device administrator

As an Intune administrator, use these compliance settings to help protect your organizational resources. To learn more about compliance policies, and what they do, see [get started with device compliance](device-compliance-get-started.md).

 [!INCLUDE [android_device_administrator_support](../includes/android-device-administrator-support.md)]

## Before you begin

[Create a compliance policy](create-compliance-policy.md#create-the-policy). For **Platform**, select **Android device administrator**.

## Microsoft Defender for Endpoint

- **Require the device to be at or under the machine risk score**  

  Select the maximum allowed machine risk score for devices evaluated by Microsoft Defender for Endpoint. Devices that exceed this score get marked as noncompliant.
  - **Not configured** (*default*)
  - **Clear**
  - **Low**
  - **Medium**
  - **High**

## Device Health

- **Devices managed with device administrator**  
  *Device administrator* capabilities are superseded by Android Enterprise.

  - **Not configured** (*default*)
  - **Block** - Blocking device administrator guides users to move to Android Enterprise Personally Owned and Corporate Owned Work Profile management to regain access.

- **Rooted devices**  
  Prevent rooted devices from having corporate access. (This compliance check is supported for Android 4.0 and above.)

  - **Not configured** (*default*) - This setting isn't evaluated for compliance or noncompliance.
  - **Block** - Mark rooted devices as not compliant.

- **Require the device to be at or under the Device Threat Level**  
  Use this setting to take the risk assessment from a connected Mobile Threat Defense service as a condition for compliance.

  - **Not configured** (*default*) - This setting isn't evaluated for compliance or noncompliance.
  - **Secured** - This option is the most secure, as the device can't have any threats. If the device is detected with any level of threats, the device is evaluated as noncompliant.
  - **Low** - The device is evaluated as compliant if only low-level threats are present. Anything higher puts the device in a noncompliant status.
  - **Medium** - The device is evaluated as compliant if existing threats on the device are low or medium level. If the device is detected to have high-level threats, the device is determined to be noncompliant.
  - **High** - This option is the least secure, and allows all threat levels. It can be useful if you're using this solution only for reporting purposes.

### Google Play Protect

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Devices operating in countries/regions where Google Mobile Services are not available will fail Google Play Protect compliance policy setting evaluations. For more information, see [Managing Android devices where Google Mobile Services are not available](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/intune-customer-success/intune-customer-success-managing-android-devices-where-google/ba-p/1628793).

- **Google Play Services is configured**  
  Google Play services allows security updates, and is a base-level dependency for many security features on certified-Google devices.

  - **Not configured** (*default*) - This setting isn't evaluated for compliance or noncompliance.  
  - **Require** - Require that the Google Play services app is installed and enabled.  

- **Up-to-date security provider**

  - **Not configured** (*default*) - This setting isn't evaluated for compliance or noncompliance.
  - **Require** - Require that an up-to-date security provider can protect a device from known vulnerabilities.

- **Threat scan on apps**

  - **Not configured** (*default*) - This setting isn't evaluated for compliance or noncompliance.
  - **Require** - Require that the Android **Verify Apps** feature is enabled.

  > [!NOTE]
  > On the legacy Android platform, this feature is a compliance setting. Intune can only check whether this setting is enabled at the device level.

- **Play integrity verdict**  
  Enter the level of Google's [Play Integrity](https://developer.android.com/google/play/integrity) that must be met. Your options:

  - **Not configured** (*default*) - This setting isn't evaluated for compliance or noncompliance.
  - **Check basic integrity**
  - **Check basic integrity & device integrity**

> [!NOTE]
> To configure Google Play Protect settings using app protection policies, see [Intune app protection policy settings](../apps/app-protection-policy-settings-android.md#conditional-launch) on Android.

## Device Properties

### Operating System Version

- **Minimum OS version**  
  When a device doesn't meet the minimum OS version requirement, the devices is reported as noncompliant. A link with information about how to upgrade is shown. The end user can choose to upgrade their device, and then get access to company resources.

  *By default, no version is configured*.

- **Maximum OS version**  
  When a device is using an OS version later than the version specified in the rule, access to company resources is blocked. The user is asked to contact their IT admin. Until a rule is changed to allow the OS version, this device can't access company resources.

  *By default, no version is configured*.

## System Security

### Encryption

- **Require encryption of data storage on device**  
  *Supported on Android 11 and earlier, or Samsung KNOX Android 14 and earlier*.

  - **Not configured** (*default*) - This setting isn't evaluated for compliance or noncompliance.
  - **Require** - Encrypt data storage on your devices. Devices are encrypted when you choose the **Require a password to unlock mobile devices** setting.

### Device Security

- **Block apps from unknown sources**  
  *Supported on Android 4.0 to Android 7.x. Not supported by Android 8.0 and later*
