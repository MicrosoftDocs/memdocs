> [!IMPORTANT]
> Android device administrator management is deprecated and no longer available for devices with access to Google Mobile Services (GMS). If you currently use device administrator management, we recommend switching to another Android management option. For more information, see [Ending support for Android device administrator on GMS devices](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/intune-customer-success/microsoft-intune-ending-support-for-android-device-administrator/ba-p/3915443). Support and help documentation remain available for devices without GMS, running Android 15 and earlier.
