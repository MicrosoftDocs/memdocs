#### Level 3 enterprise high data protection

Level 3 is the data protection configuration recommended as a standard for organizations with large and sophisticated security organizations, or for specific users and groups who will be uniquely targeted by adversaries. Such organizations are typically targeted by well-funded and sophisticated adversaries, and as such merit the additional constraints and controls described. This configuration expands upon the configuration in Level 2 by restricting additional data transfer scenarios, increasing the complexity of the PIN configuration, and adding mobile threat detection.  

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The policy settings enforced in level 3 include all the policy settings recommended for level 2 but only lists those settings below that have been added or changed to implement more controls and a more sophisticated configuration than level 2. These policy settings can have a potentially significant impact to users or to applications, enforcing a level of security commensurate with the risks facing targeted organizations.
