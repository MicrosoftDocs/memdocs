These notices provide important information that can help you prepare for future Intune changes and features.

### Take Action: Update to the latest Intune App SDK for iOS and Intune App Wrapping Tool for iOS

To support the upcoming release of iOS/iPadOS 18.1, update to the latest versions of the Intune App SDK and the Intune App Wrapping Tool to ensure applications stay secure and run smoothly. **Important:** If you don't update to the latest versions, some app protection policies may not apply to your app in certain scenarios. Review the following GitHub announcements for more details on the specific impact:

- SDK for iOS: [Update recommended prior to iOS 18.1 general availability - microsoftconnect/ms-intune-app-sdk-ios - Discussion #477](https://github.com/microsoftconnect/ms-intune-app-sdk-ios/discussions/477)
- Wrapper for iOS: [Update recommended prior to iOS 18.1 general availability - microsoftconnect/intune-app-wrapping-tool-ios - Discussion #125](https://github.com/microsoftconnect/intune-app-wrapping-tool-ios/discussions/125)

As a best practice, always update your iOS apps to the latest App SDK or App Wrapping Tool to ensure that your app continues to run smoothly.

#### How does this affect you or your users?

If you have applications using the Intune App SDK or Intune App Wrapping Tool, you'll need to update to the latest version to support iOS 18.1.

#### How can you prepare?

For apps running on iOS 18.1, you must update to the new version of the Intune App SDK for iOS

- For apps built with XCode 15 use v19.7.1 - [Release 19.7.1 - microsoftconnect/ms-intune-app-sdk-ios - GitHub](https://github.com/microsoftconnect/ms-intune-app-sdk-ios/releases/tag/19.7.1)
- For apps built with XCode 16 use v20.1.2 - [Release 20.1.2 - microsoftconnect/ms-intune-app-sdk-ios - GitHub](https://github.com/microsoftconnect/ms-intune-app-sdk-ios/releases/tag/20.1.2)

For apps running on iOS 18.1, you must update to the new version of the Intune App Wrapping Tool for iOS

- For apps built with XCode 15 use v19.7.1 - [Release 19.7.1 - microsoftconnect/intune-app-wrapping-tool-ios - GitHub](https://github.com/microsoftconnect/intune-app-wrapping-tool-ios/releases/tag/19.7.1)
- For apps built with XCode 16 use v20.1.2 - [Release 20.1.2 - microsoftconnect/intune-app-wrapping-tool-ios - GitHub](https://github.com/microsoftconnect/intune-app-wrapping-tool-ios/releases/tag/20.1.2)

Notify your users as applicable, to ensure they upgrade their apps to the latest version prior to upgrading to iOS 18.1. You can review the Intune App SDK version in use by your users in the Microsoft Intune admin center by navigating to **Apps** > **Monitor** > **App protection status**, then review “Platform version” and “iOS SDK version”.

### Take Action: Enable multifactor authentication for your tenant before October 15, 2024

Starting on or after October 15, 2024, to further increase security, Microsoft will require admins to use multi-factor authentication (MFA) when signing into the Microsoft Azure portal, Microsoft Entra admin center, and Microsoft Intune admin center. To take advantage of the extra layer of protection MFA offers, we recommend enabling MFA as soon as possible. To learn more, review [Planning for mandatory multifactor authentication for Azure and admin portals](https://aka.ms/mfaforazure).

> [!NOTE]
> This requirement also applies to any services accessed through the Intune admin center, such as Windows 365 Cloud PC.

#### How does this affect you or your users?

MFA must be enabled for your tenant to ensure admins are able to sign-in to the Azure portal, Microsoft Entra admin center and Intune admin center after this change.

#### How can you prepare?

- If you haven't already, [set up MFA](https://aka.ms/mfaforazure) before **October 15, 2024**, to ensure your admins can access the Azure portal, Microsoft Entra admin center, and Intune admin center.
- If you're unable to set up MFA before this date, you can [apply to postpone the enforcement date](https://aka.ms/managemfaforazure).
- If MFA hasn't been set up before the enforcement starts, admins will be prompted to register for MFA before they can access the Azure portal, Microsoft Entra admin center, or Intune admin center on their next sign-in.

For more information, refer to: [Planning for mandatory multifactor authentication for Azure and admin portals](https://aka.ms/mfaforazure).

### Plan for Change: Intune is moving to support iOS/iPadOS 16 and later<!--28391935-->

Later this year, we expect iOS 18 and iPadOS 18 to be released by Apple. Microsoft Intune, including the Intune Company Portal and Intune app protection policies (APP, also known as MAM), will require [iOS 16/iPadOS 16 and higher](../fundamentals/supported-devices-browsers.md) shortly after the iOS/iPadOS 18 release.

#### How does this affect you or your users?

If you're managing iOS/iPadOS devices, you might have devices that won't be able to upgrade to the minimum supported version (iOS 16/iPadOS 16).

Given that Microsoft 365 mobile apps are supported on iOS 16/iPadOS 16 and higher, this may not affect you. You've likely already upgraded your OS or devices.

To check which devices support iOS 16 or iPadOS 16 (if applicable), see the following Apple documentation:

- [Supported iPhone models](https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/supported-models-iphe3fa5df43/16.0/ios/16.0)
- [Supported iPad models](https://support.apple.com/guide/ipad/supported-models-ipad213a25b2/16.0/ipados/16.0)

> [!NOTE]
> Userless iOS and iPadOS devices enrolled through Automated Device Enrollment (ADE) have a slightly nuanced support statement due to their shared usage. The minimum supported OS version will change to iOS 16/iPadOS 16 while the allowed OS version will change to iOS 13/iPadOS 13 and later. See [this statement about ADE Userless support](https://aka.ms/ADE_userless_support) for more information.

#### How can you prepare?

Check your Intune reporting to see what devices or users might be affected. For devices with mobile device management (MDM), go to **Devices** > **All devices** and filter by OS. For devices with app protection policies, go to **Apps** > **Monitor** > **App protection status** and use the *Platform* and *Platform version* columns to filter.

To manage the supported OS version in your organization, you can use Microsoft Intune controls for both MDM and APP. For more information, see [Manage operating system versions with Intune](../fundamentals/manage-os-versions.md).

### Plan for change: Intune is moving to support macOS 13 and higher later this year<!--28391869-->

Later this year, we expect macOS 15 Sequoia to be released by Apple. Microsoft Intune, the Company Portal app and the Intune mobile device management agent will be moving to support macOS 13 and later. Since the Company Portal app for iOS and macOS are a unified app, this change will occur shortly after the release of macOS 15. This doesn't affect existing enrolled devices.

#### How does this affect you or your users?

This change only affects you if you currently manage, or plan to manage, macOS devices with Intune. This change might not affect you because your users have likely already upgraded their macOS devices. For a list of supported devices, see [macOS Ventura is compatible with these computers](https://support.apple.com/102861).

> [!NOTE]
> Devices that are currently enrolled on macOS 12.x or below will continue to remain enrolled even when those versions are no longer supported. New devices will be unable to enroll if they are running macOS 12.x or below.

#### How can you prepare?

Check your Intune reporting to see what devices or users might be affected. Go to **Devices** > **All devices** and filter by macOS. You can add more columns to help identify who in your organization has devices running macOS 12.x or earlier. Ask your users to upgrade their devices to a supported OS version.

### Plan for Change: Ending support for Intune App SDK Xamarin Bindings in May 2024<!--27143739-->

With the [end of support for Xamarin Bindings](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/platform/support/policy/xamarin), Intune will end support for Xamarin apps and the Intune App SDK Xamarin Bindings beginning on **May 1, 2024**.

#### How does this affect you or your users?

If you have iOS and/or Android apps built with Xamarin and are using the Intune App SDK Xamarin Bindings to enable app protection policies, upgrade your apps to .NET MAUI.  

#### How can you prepare?

Upgrade your Xamarin based apps to .NET MAUI. Review the following documentation for more information on Xamarin support and upgrading your apps:

- [Xamarin Support Policy | .NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/platform/support/policy/xamarin)
- [Upgrade from Xamarin to .NET | Microsoft Lear](/dotnet/maui/migration/?view=net-maui-8.0&preserve-view=true)
- [Microsoft Intune App SDK for .NET MAUI – Android | NuGet Gallery](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Intune.Maui.Essentials.android)
- [Microsoft Intune App SDK for .NET MAUI – iOS | NuGet Gallery](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Intune.Maui.Essentials.iOS)

### Plan for Change: Update your PowerShell scripts with a Microsoft Entra ID registered app ID<!--26960016-->

Last year we announced a [new Microsoft Intune GitHub repository](https://aka.ms/Intune/Scripts-blog) based on the Microsoft Graph SDK-based PowerShell module. The legacy Microsoft Intune PowerShell sample scripts GitHub repository is now read-only. Additionally, in **May 2024**, due to updated authentication methods in the Graph SDK-based PowerShell module, the global Microsoft Intune PowerShell application (client) ID based authentication method will be removed.

#### How does this affect you or your users?

If you're using the Intune PowerShell application ID (d1ddf0e4-d672-4dae-b554-9d5bdfd93547), you'll need to update your scripts with a Microsoft Entra ID registered application ID to prevent your scripts from breaking.

#### How can you prepare?

Update your PowerShell scripts by:

1. Creating a new app registration in the Microsoft Entra admin center. For detailed instructions, read: [Quickstart: Register an application with the Microsoft identity platform](/entra/identity-platform/quickstart-register-app).
2. Update scripts containing the Intune application ID (d1ddf0e4-d672-4dae-b554-9d5bdfd93547) with the new application ID created in step 1.

For detailed step-by-step instructions visit [powershell-intune-samples/Updating App Registration (github.com)](https://github.com/microsoftgraph/powershell-intune-samples/blob/master/Updating%20App%20Registration).

### Intune moving to support Android 10 and later for user-based management methods in October 2024<!--14755802-->

In October 2024, Intune will be moving to support Android 10 and later for user-based management methods, which includes:

- Android Enterprise personally-owned work profile
- Android Enterprise corporate owned work profile
- Android Enterprise fully managed
- Android Open Source Project (AOSP) user-based
- Android device administrator
- App protection policies (APP)
- App configuration policies (ACP) for managed apps

Moving forward, we'll end support for one or two versions annually in October until we only support the latest four major versions of Android. You can learn more about this change by reading the blog: [Intune moving to support Android 10 and later for user-based management methods in October 2024](https://aka.ms/Intune/Android-10-support).

> [!NOTE]
> Userless methods of Android device management (Dedicated and AOSP userless) and Microsoft Teams certified Android devices won't be impacted by this change.

#### How does this affect you or your users?

For user-based management methods (as listed above), Android devices running Android 9 or earlier won't be supported. For devices on unsupported Android OS versions:

- Intune technical support won't be provided.
- Intune won't make changes to address bugs or issues.
- New and existing features aren't guaranteed to work.

While Intune won't prevent enrollment or management of devices on unsupported Android OS versions, functionality isn't guaranteed, and use isn't recommended.

#### How can you prepare?

Notify your helpdesk, if applicable, about this updated support statement. The following admin options are available to help warn or block users:

- Configure a [conditional launch](../apps/app-protection-policy-settings-android.md#conditional-launch) setting for APP with a minimum OS version requirement to warn and/or block users.
- Use a device compliance policy and set the action for noncompliance to send a message to users before marking them as noncompliant.
- Set [enrollment restrictions](../fundamentals/manage-os-versions.md) to prevent enrollment on devices running older versions.

For more information, review: [Manage operating system versions with Microsoft Intune](../fundamentals/manage-os-versions.md).

### Plan for Change: Web based device enrollment will become default method for iOS/iPadOS device enrollment

Today, when creating iOS/iPadOS enrollment profiles, “Device enrollment with Company Portal” is shown as the default method. In an upcoming service release, the default method will change to “Web based device enrollment” during profile creation. Additionally for *new* tenants, if no enrollment profile is created, the user will enroll using web-based device enrollment.

> [!NOTE]
> For web enrollment, you will need to deploy the single sign-on (SSO) extension policy to enable just in time (JIT) registration, for more information review: [Set up just in time registration in Microsoft Intune](../enrollment/set-up-just-in-time-registration.md).

#### How does this affect you or your users?

This is an update to the user interface when creating new iOS/iPadOS enrollment profiles to display “Web based device enrollment” as the default method, existing profiles are not impacted. For *new* tenants, if no enrollment profile is created, the user will enroll using web-based device enrollment.

#### How can you prepare?

Update your documentation and user guidance as needed. If you currently use device enrollment with Company Portal, we recommend moving to web based device enrollment and deploying the SSO extension policy to enable JIT registration.

**Additional information:**

- [Set up just in time registration in Microsoft Intune](../enrollment/set-up-just-in-time-registration.md)
- [Set up web based device enrollment for iOS](../enrollment/web-based-device-enrollment-ios.md)

### Plan for Change: Transition Jamf macOS devices from Conditional Access to Device Compliance

We've been working with Jamf on a migration plan to help customers transition macOS devices from Jamf Pro’s Conditional Access integration to their Device Compliance integration. The Device Compliance integration uses the newer Intune partner compliance management API, which involves a simpler setup than the partner device management API and brings macOS devices onto the same API as iOS devices managed by Jamf Pro. The platform Jamf Pro’s Conditional Access feature is built on will no longer be supported after September 1, 2024.

Note that customers in some environments cannot be transitioned initially, for more details and updates read the blog: [Support tip: Transitioning Jamf macOS devices from Conditional Access to Device Compliance](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/intune-customer-success/support-tip-transitioning-jamf-macos-devices-from-conditional/ba-p/3913059).

#### How does this affect you or your users?

If you're using Jamf Pro’s Conditional Access integration for macOS devices, follow Jamf’s documented guidelines to migrate your devices to Device Compliance integration: [Migrating from macOS Conditional Access to macOS Device Compliance – Jamf Pro Documentation](https://learn.jamf.com/bundle/jamf-pro-documentation-current/page/Conditional_Access.html#ariaid-title6).

After the Device Compliance integration is complete, some users might see a one-time prompt to enter their Microsoft credentials.

#### How can you prepare?

If applicable, follow the instructions provided by Jamf to migrate your macOS devices. If you need help, contact Jamf Customer Success. For more information and the latest updates, read the blog post: [Support tip: Transitioning Jamf macOS devices from Conditional Access to Device Compliance](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/intune-customer-success/support-tip-transitioning-jamf-macos-devices-from-conditional/ba-p/3913059).

### Plan for Change: Intune ending support for Android device administrator on devices with GMS access in December 2024

[Google has deprecated](https://blog.google/products/android-enterprise/da-migration/) Android device administrator management, continues to remove management capabilities, and no longer provides fixes or improvements. Due to these changes, Intune will be ending support for Android device administrator management on devices with access to Google Mobile Services (GMS) beginning **December 31, 2024**. Until that time, we support device administrator management on devices running Android 14 and earlier. For more details, read the blog: [Microsoft Intune ending support for Android device administrator on devices with GMS access](https://aka.ms/Intune-Android-DA-blog).

#### How does this affect you or your users?

After Intune ends support for Android device administrator, devices with access to GMS will be impacted in the following ways:

1. Users won't be able to enroll devices with Android device administrator.
2. Intune won't make changes or updates to Android device administrator management, such as bug fixes, security fixes, or fixes to address changes in new Android versions.
3. Intune technical support will no longer support these devices.

#### How can you prepare?

Stop enrolling devices into Android device administrator and migrate impacted devices to other management methods. You can check your Intune reporting to see which devices or users might be affected. Go to **Devices** > **All devices** and filter the OS column to **Android (device administrator)** to see the list of devices.

Read the blog, [Microsoft Intune ending support for Android device administrator on devices with GMS access](https://aka.ms/Intune-Android-DA-blog), for our recommended alternative Android device management methods and information about the impact to devices without access to GMS.

### Plan for Change: Ending support for Microsoft Store for Business and Education apps

In April 2023, we began ending support for the Microsoft Store for Business experience in Intune. This occurs in several stages. For more information, see: [Adding your Microsoft Store for Business and Education apps to the Microsoft Store in Intune](https://aka.ms/Intune/MSfB-support)

### How does this affect you or your users?

If you're using Microsoft Store for Business and Education apps:

1. On April 30, 2023, Intune will disconnect Microsoft Store for Business services. Microsoft Store for Business and Education apps won't be able to sync with Intune and the connector page will be removed from the Intune admin center.
2. On June 15, 2023, Intune will stop enforcing online and offline Microsoft Store for Business and Education apps on devices. Downloaded applications remain on the device with limited support. Users might still be able to access the app from their device, but the app won't be managed. Existing synced Intune app objects remain to allow admins to view the apps that had been synced and their assignments. Additionally, you'll not be able to sync apps via the Microsoft Graph API syncMicrosoftStoreForBusinessApps and related API properties will display stale data.
3. On September 15, 2023, Microsoft Store for Business and Education apps will be removed from the Intune admin center. Apps on the device remain until intentionally removed. The Microsoft Graph API microsoftStoreForBusinessApp will no longer be available about a month later.

The retirement of Microsoft Store for Business and Education was [announced in 2021](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/windows-it-pro-blog/evolving-the-microsoft-store-for-business-and-education/ba-p/2569423). When the Microsoft Store for Business and Education portals are retired, admins will no longer be able to manage the list of Microsoft Store for Business and Education apps that are synced or download offline content from the Microsoft Store for Business and Education portals.

### How can you prepare?

We recommend adding your apps through the new Microsoft Store app experience in Intune. If an app isn't available in the Microsoft Store, you need to retrieve an app package from the vendor and install it as a line-of-business (LOB) app or Win32 app. For instructions read the following articles:

- [Add Microsoft Store apps to Microsoft Intune](../apps/store-apps-microsoft.md)
- [Add a Windows line-of-business app to Microsoft Intune](../apps/lob-apps-windows.md)
- [Add, assign, and monitor a Win32 app in Microsoft Intune](../apps/apps-win32-add.md)

### Plan for Change: Ending support for Windows Information Protection

Microsoft Windows [announced](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2202124) they're ending support for Windows Information Protection (WIP). The Microsoft Intune family of products will be discontinuing future investments in managing and deploying WIP. In addition to limiting future investments, we removed support for WIP *without enrollment* scenario at the end of calendar year 2022.

### How does this affect you or your users?

If you have enabled WIP policies, you should turn off or disable these policies.

### How can you prepare?

We recommend disabling WIP to ensure users in your organization do not lose access to documents that have been protected by WIP policy. Read the blog [Support tip: End of support guidance for Windows Information Protection](https://aka.ms/Intune-WIP-support) for more details and options for removing WIP from your devices.
