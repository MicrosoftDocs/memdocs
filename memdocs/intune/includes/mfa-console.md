> On October 15, 2024, Microsoft begins enforcement of the Azure sign-in requirement to use multi-factor authentication (MFA). When enforced, MFA must be used by all users who sign-in to Intune admin center regardless of any roles they have or don’t have. The MFA requirements also apply to services that are accessed through the admin center, like Windows 365 Cloud PC, and to use of the Microsoft Azure portal and Microsoft Entra admin center.  MFA requirements don’t apply to end users who access applications, websites, or services hosted on Azure where those users don’t sign-in to the admin center.
>
> The requirement to sign-in using MFA applies to all Intune subscriptions, including Plan 1 subscriptions with or without add-ons, and free trial subscriptions. The prerequisites and process required to configure MFA depend on the MFA method you choose to use for your tenant. Shortly after MFA is enabled for a tenant, subsequent sign-in attemps will require the user to complete setup for using the configured MFA solution.
>
> To learn more about the MFA requirement, see [Planning for mandatory multifactor authentication for Azure and admin portals](/entra/identity/authentication/concept-mandatory-multifactor-authentication) in the Entra documentation.
>
> In the Entra planning article you’ll also find guidance and resources to help you [Prepare for multifactor authentication](/entra/identity/authentication/concept-mandatory-multifactor-authentication#prepare-for-multifactor-authentication), including methods to configure MFA including but not limited to:
