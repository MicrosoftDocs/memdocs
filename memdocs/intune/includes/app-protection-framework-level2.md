#### Level 2 enterprise enhanced data protection

Level 2 is the data protection configuration recommended as a standard for devices where users access more sensitive information. These devices are a natural target in enterprises today. These recommendations don't assume a large staff of highly skilled security practitioners, and therefore should be accessible to most enterprise organizations. This configuration expands upon the configuration in Level 1 by restricting data transfer scenarios and by requiring a minimum operating system version.

The policy settings enforced in level 2 include all the policy settings recommended for level 1 but only lists those settings below that have been added or changed to implement more controls and a more sophisticated configuration than level 1. While these settings may have a slightly higher impact to users or to applications, they enforce a level of data protection more commensurate with the risks facing users with access to sensitive information on mobile devices.

This   setting allows data transfer to other policy managed apps, as well as   file transfers to other apps that have are managed by   Intune. </p><p>Policy managed apps with Open-In/Share filtering   filters the OS Open-in/Share dialogs to only display policy managed   apps. </p><p> For more information, see [iOS app protection policy   settings](/mem/intune/apps/app-protection-policy-settings-ios).</p> |

|       App   conditions  |          Disabled account  |        N/A / Block access  |          iOS/iPadOS,   Android        |  |
| Device conditions  |       Min   OS version  |          *Format: Major.Minor.Build <br>Example:   14.8* / Block access |          iOS/iPadOS        | Microsoft recommends configuring the minimum iOS   major version to match the supported iOS versions for Microsoft apps.   Microsoft apps support an N-1 approach where N is the current iOS major   release version. For minor and build version values, Microsoft recommends   ensuring devices are up to date with the respective security updates. See   [Apple security updates](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201222) for Apple's latest recommendations |
| Device conditions  |       Min   OS version  |          *Format: Major.Minor<br>   Example: 9.0* / Block access   |          Android        | Microsoft recommends configuring   the minimum Android major version to match the supported Android versions for   Microsoft apps. OEMs and devices adhering to Android Enterprise recommended   requirements must support the current shipping release + one letter upgrade.   Currently, Android recommends Android 9.0 and later for knowledge workers.   See [Android Enterprise Recommended requirements](https://www.android.com/enterprise/recommended/requirements/) for Android's latest   recommendations |
| Device conditions  |       Min patch   version  |          *Format:   YYYY-MM-DD <br> Example: 2020-01-01* / Block access  |          Android        | Android devices can receive monthly security patches, but the   release is dependent on OEMs and/or carriers. Organizations should ensure   that deployed Android devices do receive security updates before implementing   this setting. See [Android Security Bulletins](https://source.android.com/security/bulletin/) for the latest patch   releases.  |
| Device conditions  |       Required SafetyNet evaluation type  |          Hardware-backed key  |          Android  |          Hardware backed attestation enhances the existing SafetyNet attestation service check by leveraging a new evaluation type called [Hardware Backed](https://developer.android.com/training/safetynet/attestation#evaluation-types), providing a more robust root detection in response to newer types of rooting tools and methods that can't always be reliably detected by a software only solution.<p> As its name implies, hardware backed attestation leverages a hardware-based component which shipped with devices installed with Android 8.1 and later. Devices that were upgraded from an older version of Android to Android 8.1 are unlikely to have the hardware-based components necessary for hardware backed attestation. While this setting should be widely supported starting with devices that shipped with Android 8.1, Microsoft strongly recommends testing devices individually before enabling this policy setting broadly.</p>  |
| Device conditions  |       Require device lock  |          Medium/Block Access  |          Android        | This setting ensures that Android devices have a device password that meets the minimum password requirements.  |
| Device conditions  |       Samsung Knox device attestation  |          Block Access  |          Android        | Microsoft recommends configuring the **Samsung Knox device attestation** setting to **Block access** to ensure the user account is blocked from access if the device doesn't meet Samsung's Knox hardware-based verification of device health.  This setting verifies all Intune MAM client responses to the Intune service were sent from a healthy device.  <p> This setting will apply to all devices targeted.  To apply this setting only to Samsung devices, you can use "Managed apps" assignment filters.  For more information on assignment filters, see [Use filters when assigning your apps, policies, and profiles in Microsoft Intune](/mem/intune/fundamentals/filters).|
