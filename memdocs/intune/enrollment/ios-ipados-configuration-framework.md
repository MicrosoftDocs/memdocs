# iOS/iPadOS Enterprise security configuration framework

The iOS/iPadOS security configuration framework is a series of recommendations for device compliance and configuration policy settings. These recommendations help you tailor your organization's mobile device security protection to your specific needs.

[!INCLUDE [configuration-framework-1](../includes/configuration-framework-1.md)]

- [iOS/iPadOS framework deployment methodology](ios-ipados-framework-deployment-methodology.md): A recommended methodology for deploying the security configuration framework.
-  [Set app configuration policies for iOS/iPadOS devices](ios-ipados-app-configuration-policies.md): Configure apps on the devices to disallow personal accounts.
- [iOS/iPadOS device compliance security settings](ios-ipados-device-compliance-security-configurations.md): Specific configuration settings for ensuring personally owned and corporate owned devices are healthy and compliant.
- [iOS/iPadOS personal device security settings](ios-ipados-personal-device-security-configurations.md): Specific configuration settings for basic, enhanced, and high security on personally owned devices.
- [iOS/iPadOS supervised device security settings](ios-ipados-supervised-device-security-configurations.md): Specific configuration settings for basic, enhanced, and high security on corporate owned supervised devices.

## iOS/iPadOS enrollment modes

iOS/iPadOS supports several enrollment scenarios, two of which are covered as part of this framework:

- [Device enrollment for personally owned devices](ios-enroll.md): These devices are personally owned and used for both work and personal use.
- [Supervised automated device enrollment for corporate-owned devices](device-enrollment-program-enroll-ios.md): These devices are corporate-owned, associated with a single user, and used exclusively for work and not personal use.
