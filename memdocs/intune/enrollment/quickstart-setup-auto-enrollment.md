# Quickstart: Set up automatic enrollment for Windows 10 devices

In this quickstart, you'll set up Microsoft Intune to automatically enroll devices when specific users sign in to Windows 10 devices.

If you don't have an Intune subscription, [sign up for a free trial account](../fundamentals/free-trial-sign-up.md).

## Prerequisites

- Microsoft Intune subscription - [sign up for a free trial account](../fundamentals/free-trial-sign-up.md).
- To complete this quickstart, you must first [create a user](../fundamentals/quickstart-create-user.md) and [create a group](../fundamentals/quickstart-create-group.md).

## Sign in to Intune in the Microsoft Endpoint Manager

Sign in to the [Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431) as a Global Administrator. If you have created an Intune Trial subscription, the account you created the subscription with is the Global administrator.

## Set up Windows 10 automatic enrollment

For this example, you'll use MDM enrollment so that both corporate and bring-your-own-devices can be automatically enrolled. You will sign up for a free Azure Active Directory Premium subscription.

1. In the [Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431), choose **All services** > **M365 Azure Active Directory** > **Azure Active Directory** > **Mobility (MDM and MAM)**.
2. Select **Get a free Premium trial to use this feature**. Selecting this option will allow auto enrollment using the Azure Active Directory free Premium trial.
