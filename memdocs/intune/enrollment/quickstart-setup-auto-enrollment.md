# Step 4: Set up automatic enrollment for Windows 10/11 devices  

**Applies to**:

- Windows 10  
- Windows 11  

In this task, you'll set up Microsoft Intune to automatically enroll corporate-owned devices, and user-owned devices for bring-your-own-device (BYOD) deployments. You can scope automatic enrollment to some Microsoft Entra users, all users, or none. 

[!INCLUDE [intune-evaluate](../includes/intune-evaluate.md)]

If you don't have an Intune subscription, [sign up for a free trial account](../fundamentals/free-trial-sign-up.md) to try out this tutorial. 

## Prerequisites 

- Microsoft Intune subscription - [sign up for a free trial account](../fundamentals/free-trial-sign-up.md).
- To complete this step, you must:  
  - [Create a user](../fundamentals/quickstart-create-user.md).  
  - [Create a group](../fundamentals/quickstart-create-group.md).
  - [Have Microsoft Entra ID P1 or P2](/azure/active-directory/active-directory-get-started-premium) or the [Premium trial subscription](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=816845). You can activate a free Premium trial subscription during setup.  

To configure automatic MDM enrollment, you must be a [Microsoft Entra Global Administrator](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#global-administrator). If you signed up for a Microsoft Intune Trial subscription at the beginning of this quickstart, your account has Global Administrator permissions and can complete all procedures in this article.  

## Set up automatic enrollment  

For this example, you'll configure Microsoft Intune mobile device management (MDM) enrollment settings so that corporate-owned and personal devices automatically enroll in Microsoft Intune. *MDM user scope* enables automatic enrollment for Microsoft Intune device management. 

1. In the [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431), go to **Devices** > **Enrollment**.     
2. Go to the **Windows** tab. Then select **Automatic Enrollment**.  

> [!IMPORTANT]
>  Automatic MDM enrollment is a premium Microsoft Entra feature available for Microsoft Entra ID Premium subscribers. If you can't see the automatic enrollment settings, select **Automatic MDM enrollment is available only for Microsoft Entra ID Premium subscribers** to activate a free trial.   
 
3. Select **Microsoft Intune**.   
4. Configure the MDM and WIP user scope.   
   1. For **MDM user scope** select **All**. Or you can select **Some** and select **Contoso Testers** as the group. Make sure users aren't members of a group targeted by the WIP user scope.     
   2. For **WIP user scope**, select **None**. We're only setting up automatic enrollment for mobile device management. 
5. Use the default values for the remaining settings on the page.    
6. Choose **Save**.  

>[!IMPORTANT]
> If you configure both user scope types for the same user:
> - The MDM user scope takes precedence if they're on a corporate-owned device. The device automatically enrolls in Microsoft Intune when they set it up for work.  
> - The WIP user scope takes precedence if they bring their own device. The device doesn't enroll in Microsoft Intune for device management. Microsoft Purview Information Protection policies are applied if you configured them. 

## Clean up resources  

To reconfigure Intune automatic enrollment, see [Set up enrollment for Windows devices](windows-enroll.md).  

## Next steps  

In this task, you learned how to set up automatic enrollment for devices running Windows 10/11. For more information about device enrollment, see [Device enrollment overview](../fundamentals/deployment-guide-enrollment.md).
