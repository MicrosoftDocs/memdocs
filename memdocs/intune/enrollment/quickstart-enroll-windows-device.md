# Step 5: Enroll a device  

**Applies to**:
- Windows 10 
- Windows 11 

Employees and students who want remote access to work or school resources can enroll their devices into Microsoft Intune. Enrollment ensures that all devices trying to access data within your organization are secure and compliant with your policies and requirements. Upon enrollment, the device gets access to resources like work email, files, VPN, and Wi-Fi. 

[!INCLUDE [intune-evaluate](../includes/intune-evaluate.md)]

In this task, you will: 

* Try out the device user experience by enrolling a device running Windows 10/11 into Microsoft Intune.  
* Try out the admin user experience by verifying the enrollment in the Microsoft Intune admin center.   

If you don't have an Intune subscription, [sign up for a free trial account](../fundamentals/free-trial-sign-up.md).  

## Prerequisites

To complete this evaluation step, you must: 

- Have a Microsoft Intune subscription: [Sign up for a free trial account](../fundamentals/free-trial-sign-up.md)
- Complete the evaluation step for [setting up automatic enrollment in Intune](quickstart-setup-auto-enrollment.md).  
- Be an [Intune Administrator](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#intune-administrator). If you signed up for an Intune Trial subscription at the beginning of this quickstart, your trial account has [Global Administrator](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#global-administrator) permissions and can complete all procedures in this article.  

Additionally, before you begin enrollment, confirm the version of Windows running on your device.  

1. Open the **Settings** app.  

2. Select **System** > **About**.

4. Confirm that the device version is:  

  * For Windows 10: 1607 or later   
  * For Windows 11: 21H2 or later  

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > The steps in this evaluation step are for these versions of Windows. For information about enrolling earlier versions of Windows, see [Enroll device running Windows 10, version 1511 and earlier](../user-help/enroll-windows-10-device.md#enroll-windows-10-version-1511-and-earlier-device).  

## Enroll device

5. Wait for your device to finish registering. When you see the **You're all set!** screen, select **Done**. Your work account should now be visible under **Accounts**.
