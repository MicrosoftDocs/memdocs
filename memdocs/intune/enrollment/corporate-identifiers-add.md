# Identify devices as corporate-owned

As an Intune admin, you can identify devices as corporate-owned to refine management and identification. Intune can perform additional management tasks and collect additional information such as the full phone number and an inventory of apps from corporate-owned devices. You can also set device restrictions to block enrollment by devices that aren't corporate-owned.

At the time of enrollment, Intune automatically assigns corporate-owned status to devices that are:

- Enrolled with a [device enrollment manager](device-enrollment-manager-enroll.md) account (all platforms)
- Enrolled by using [Google Zero Touch](android-dedicated-devices-fully-managed-enroll.md#enroll-by-using-google-zero-touch)
- Enrolled by using [Knox Mobile Enrollment](android-samsung-knox-mobile-enroll.md)
- Enrolled with the Apple [Device Enrollment Program](device-enrollment-program-enroll-ios.md), [Apple School Manager](apple-school-manager-set-up-ios.md), or [Apple Configurator](apple-configurator-enroll-ios.md) (iOS/iPadOS only)
- [Identified as corporate-owned before enrollment](#identify-corporate-owned-devices-with-imei-or-serial-number) with an international mobile equipment identifier (IMEI) numbers (all platforms with IMEI numbers) or serial number (iOS/iPadOS and Android)
- Enrolled as [Android Enterprise corporate-owned devices with work profile](./android-corporate-owned-work-profile-enroll.md)
- Enrolled as [Android Enterprise fully managed devices](./android-fully-managed-enroll.md)
- Enrolled as [Android Enterprise dedicated devices](./android-kiosk-enroll.md)
- Joined to Microsoft Entra ID with work or school credentials. [Devices that are Microsoft Entra registered](/azure/active-directory/devices/overview) will be marked as personal.
- Set as corporate in the [device's properties list](#change-device-ownership)

After enrollment, you can [change the ownership setting](#change-device-ownership) between **Personal** and **Corporate**.

## Identify corporate-owned devices with IMEI or serial number

As an Intune admin, you can create and import a comma-separated value (.csv) file that lists 14-digit IMEI numbers or serial numbers. Intune uses these identifiers to specify device ownership as corporate during device enrollment. Each IMEI or serial number can have details specified in the list for administrative purposes.


 [!INCLUDE [android_device_administrator_support](../includes/android-device-administrator-support.md)]

This feature is supported for the following platforms:

| Platform | IMEI numbers | Serial numbers |
|---|---|---|
| Windows | Not supported | Not supported |
| iOS/iPadOS | Supported in some cases. See Important note below.  | Supported |
| macOS | Not supported | Supported |
| Android device administrator, before Android v10 | Supported | Supported |
| Android device administrator, Android v10 and later | Not supported | Not supported |
| Android Enterprise personally-owned work profile, before Android 12 | Supported | Supported |
| Android Enterprise personally-owned work profile, Android 12 and later | Not supported | Not supported |
| Android Enterprise corporate-owned work profile | Not supported | Not supported |
| Android Enterprise fully managed | Not supported | Not supported |
| Android Enterprise dedicated devices | Not supported | Not supported |

<!-- When you upload serial numbers for corporate-owned iOS/iPadOS devices, they must be paired with a corporate enrollment profile. Devices must then be enrolled using either Apple's Automated Device Enrollment or Apple Configurator to have them appear as corporate-owned. -->

## Add corporate identifiers by using a .csv file
To create the list, create a two-column, comma-separated value (.csv) list without a header. Add the 14-digit IMEI or serial numbers in the left column, and the details in the right column. Only one type of ID, IMEI or serial number, can be imported in a single .csv file. Details are limited to 128 characters and are for administrative use only. Details aren't displayed on the device. The current limit is 5,000 rows per .csv file.

**Upload a .csv file that has serial numbers** â€“ Create a two-column, comma-separated value (.csv) list without a header, and limit the list to 5,000 devices or 5 MB per .csv file.

This .csv file when viewed in a text editor appears as:

```
01234567890123,device details
02234567890123,device details
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Some Android and iOS/iPadOS devices have multiple IMEI numbers. Intune only reads one IMEI number per enrolled device. If you import an IMEI number but it is not the IMEI inventoried by Intune, the device is classified as a personal device instead of a corporate-owned device. If you import multiple IMEI numbers for a device, uninventoried numbers display **Unknown** for enrollment status.<br>
>Also note:
>Serial Numbers are the recommended form of identification for iOS/iPadOS devices.
>Android Serial numbers are not guaranteed to be unique or present. Check with your device supplier to understand if serial number is a reliable device ID.
>Serial numbers reported by the device to Intune might not match the displayed ID in the Android Settings/About menus on the device. Verify the type of serial number reported by the device manufacturer.
>Attempting to upload a file with serial numbers containing dots (.) will cause the upload to fail. Serial numbers with dots are not supported.

### Upload a .csv list of corporate identifiers

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431).
2. Go to **Devices** > **Enroll devices**.
3. Select **Corporate device identifiers**. 
4. Select **Add** > **Upload CSV file**.  
5. In **Add identifiers**, specify the identifier type: **IMEI** or **Serial**.  
6. Select the folder icon and specify the path to the list you want to import. 
7. Go to the .csv file, and then select **Add**. 
8. The **Review duplicate identifiers** pop-up window appears if the CSV file contains corporate identifiers that are already in Intune, but have different details.  Select the identifiers that you want to overwrite into Intune and choose **Ok** to add the identifiers. Intune only compares the first duplicate of each identifier.    

## Manually enter corporate identifiers

1. Go to **Devices** > **Enroll devices**.  
2. Select **Corporate device identifiers**.  
3. Select > **Add** > **Enter manually**.  
4. In **Add identifiers**, specify the identifier type: **IMEI** or **Serial**.  
5. Enter the **Identifier** and **Details** for each identifier you want to add. When you're done entering identifiers, select **Add**.  
6. The **Review duplicate identifiers** pop-up window appears if your entries contain corporate identifiers that are already in Intune, but have different details.  Select the identifiers that you want to overwrite into Intune and choose **Ok** to add the identifiers. Intune only compares the first duplicate of each identifier. 

You can select **Refresh** to see new device identifiers.  

Imported devices are not necessarily enrolled. Devices can have a state of either **Enrolled** or **Not contacted**. **Not contacted** means that the device has never communicated in with the Intune service.

## Delete corporate identifiers

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431), choose **Devices** > **Enroll devices** > **Corporate device identifiers**.
2. Select the device identifiers you want to delete, and choose **Delete**.
3. Confirm the deletion.

Deleting a corporate identifier for an enrolled device does not change the device's ownership. To change a device's ownership, go **Devices**, select the device, choose **Properties**, and change **Device ownership**.

## IMEI specifications
For detailed specifications about International Mobile Equipment Identifiers, see [3GGPP TS 23.003](https://portal.3gpp.org/desktopmodules/Specifications/SpecificationDetails.aspx?specificationId=729).

## Change device ownership

Devices properties display **Ownership** for each device record in Intune. As an admin, you can specify devices as **Personal** or **Corporate**.

**To change device ownership:**
1. In the [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431), choose **Devices** > **All devices**.  
1. Select a device.  
2. Choose **Properties**.  
3. Specify **Device ownership** as **Personal** or **Corporate**.  

   :::image type="content" source="./media/corporate-identifiers-add/device-properties.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Managed device properties showing Device category and Device ownership options.":::

When a device's ownership type is changed from *Corporate* to *Personal*, Intune deletes all app information previously collected from that device within seven days. If applicable, Intune will also delete the phone number on record. Intune will still collect an inventory of apps installed by the IT admin on the device and will still collect a partial phone number for the device after it is marked as personal.

When an iOS/iPad or Android device's ownership type is changed from *Personal* to *Corporate*, a push notification is sent through the Company Portal app to inform the devices user of this change.

To access the setting in the admin center, go to **Tenant administration** > **Customization**. For more information, see [Company Portal - Configuration](../apps/company-portal-app.md#configuration).
