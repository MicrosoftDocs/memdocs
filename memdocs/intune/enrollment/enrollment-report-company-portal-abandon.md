# Incomplete user enrollments report

This Microsoft Intune report tells you where in the Company Portal enrollment process users are abandoning enrollment. Use this information to improve onboarding efforts and support documents for users going through enrollment.  

To view the report:  
1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431). 
2. Go to **Devices**.  
3. Go to **Monitor** and select **Incomplete user enrollments**.  

## Overview  

An incomplete enrollment happens when the user takes any of the following actions:    

- Explicitly chooses an action to halt enrollment, such as **Decline all**, **Cancel**, or **Postpone**.  
- Closes the Company Portal during enrollment.  
- Spends more than 30 minutes between enrollment sections.  

If a user chooses to stop enrollment and restart multiple times, it shows up in the report as multiple attempts and multiple incomplete enrollments. If a user waits for 30 minutes before moving onto the next enrollment screen, it shows up in the report as multiple incomplete enrollments.  

## Report data      

The reports include data for iOS/iPadOS and Android devices. It shows data for the past two weeks, but you can filter it to show any time period up to 30 days in the past. You can filter the date range, operating system, and enrollment section by choosing **Filter**.  

### Roll-up of attempted enrollments   

At the top of the report, you can see the number and percentage of incomplete enrollments in relation to all enrollments.  

- Initiated enrollments: The number of enrollments attempted.
- Incomplete enrollments: The number of attempted enrollments that didn't result in a fully enrolled and compliant device.
- Incomplete rate: The percentage of enrollment attempts that were abandoned (Abandoned enrollments / Initiated enrollments).  

### Incomplete enrollments by section   

The line graph shows the daily incomplete enrollments for each of the four core enrollment sections:

- Setup Checklist
