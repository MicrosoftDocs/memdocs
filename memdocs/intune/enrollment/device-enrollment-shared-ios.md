# Overview of shared device solutions for iOS/iPadOS

Shared devices are organization-owned multi-user devices. These devices can be special-purpose or multi-purpose as needed in each environment. Shared devices enable front-line workers in healthcare, hospitality, retail, manufacturing, and other industries to access critical applications and tools essential to their role in the organization. In education, shared devices are used as learning aids or test-taking devices in classrooms.  

Microsoft Intune supports two types of shared device solutions for iOS and iPadOS: 
- [Shared iPads](../enrollment/device-enrollment-shared-ipad.md)
- [Shared Device Mode](/azure/active-directory/develop/msal-ios-shared-devices)

## Recommended iOS/iPadOS shared device strategy

Shared iPad is the recommended shared device solution for Microsoft 365 on iPadOS. If you're planning your organization’s shared device strategy, we recommended that you choose iPadOS devices that meet the minimum requirements for Shared iPad (see section above). 
If your organization’s shared device strategy requires cellphone capabilities or includes iOS devices, Shared Device Mode is the recommended shared device solution on iOS. 
Review the differences between Shared iPad and Shared Device Mode to ensure that the recommendations above will fit your organization’s needs.
