# Android Enterprise personally-owned work profile security configurations

As part of the [Android Enterprise security configuration framework](android-configuration-framework.md), apply the following settings for Android Enterprise work profile mobile users. For more information on each policy setting, see [Android Enterprise settings to mark devices as compliant or not compliant using Intune](../protect/compliance-policy-create-android-for-work.md#personally-owned-work-profile) and [Android Enterprise device settings to allow or restrict features using Intune](../configuration/device-restrictions-android-for-work.md#personally-owned-devices-with-a-work-profile).

When choosing your settings, be sure to review and categorize usage scenarios. Then, configure users following the guidance for the chosen security level. You can adjust the suggested settings based on the needs of your organization. Make sure to have your security team evaluate the threat environment, risk appetite, and impact to usability.

For personally-owned work profile devices, there are two recommended security configuration frameworks:

- [Personally-owned work profile basic security (level 1)](#personally-owned-work-profile-basic-security) 
- [Personally-owned work profile high security (level 3)](#personally-owned-work-profile-high-security) 

> [!Note]
> Because of the settings available for personally-owned work profile devices, there is no enhanced security (level 2) offering. The available settings don't justify a difference between level 1 and level 2.

Administrators can incorporate the below configuration levels within their ring deployment methodology for testing and production use by importing the sample [Android Enterprise Security Configuration Framework JSON templates](https://github.com/microsoft/Intune-Config-Frameworks/tree/master/AndroidEnterprise) with [Intune's PowerShell scripts](https://github.com/microsoftgraph/powershell-intune-samples).

## Personally-owned work profile basic security

Level 1 is the recommended minimum security configuration for personal devices where users access work or school data. This configuration can apply to most mobile users. Some of the controls may impact user experience.

### Device compliance

| Section | Setting | Value | Notes |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Microsoft Defender for Endpoint | Require the device to be at or under the machine risk score | Not configured ||
| Device Health | Rooted devices | Block ||
| Device Health | Require the device to be at or under the Device Threat Level | Not configured||

Only unmodified devices that have been certified by Google can pass this check. |
| Device Properties | Minimum OS version | Format: Major.Minor<br>Example: 6.0| Microsoft recommends configuring the minimum Android major version to match the supported Android versions for Microsoft apps. OEMs and devices adhering to Android Enterprise recommended requirements must support the current shipping release + one letter upgrade. Currently, Android recommends Android 9.0 and later for knowledge workers. For Android's latest recommendations, see [Android Enterprise Recommended requirements](https://www.android.com/enterprise/recommended/requirements/). |
| Device Properties | Maximum OS version | Not configured ||

> [!Note]
> When a personally-owned work profile is enabled, “One Lock” is configured by default to combine device and work profile passcodes. One Lock may be disabled to separate work profile and device passcodes if necessary, under work profile settings.

## Personally-owned work profile high security

Level 3 is the recommended configuration for devices used by users or groups who are uniquely high risk. For example, users who handle highly sensitive data where unauthorized disclosure causes considerable material loss. An organization likely to be targeted by well-funded and sophisticated adversaries merit the additional constraints described below. This configuration expands upon the configuration in Level 1 by:
- implementing mobile threat defense or Microsoft Defender for Endpoint.
- restricting personally-owned work profile data scenarios.
- enacting stronger password policies.

The policy settings enforced in level 3 include all the policy settings recommended for level 1. However, the settings listed below include only those that have been added or changed. These settings may have a slightly higher impact to users or applications. They enforce a level of security more appropriate for risks facing users with access to sensitive information on mobile devices.

### Device compliance
