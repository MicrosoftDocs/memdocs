# Set up Intune enrollment of Android Enterprise dedicated devices

[!INCLUDE [azure_portal](../includes/azure_portal.md)]

Android Enterprise supports corporate-owned, single-use, kiosk-style devices with its dedicated devices solution. These devices are used for a single purpose, such as digital signage, ticket printing, or inventory management. Admins can lock down the usage of a device to a single app, or a limited set of apps, inclusive of web apps. Users are prevented from adding other apps or taking actions on the device unless explicitly approved by admins.

Devices intended for dedicated use can be enrolled in Microsoft Intune in two different ways:

* As a standard Android Enterprise dedicated device. These devices are enrolled into Intune without a user account and aren't associated with a user. These devices aren't intended for personal apps, or apps such as Outlook or Gmail that require user-specific account data.

* As a standard Android Enterprise dedicated device that's automatically set up with Microsoft Authenticator and configured for [Microsoft Entra shared device mode](/azure/active-directory/develop/msal-shared-devices) during enrollment

  These devices are enrolled into Intune without a user account, aren't associated with a specific user, and are configured with [Microsoft Entra shared device mode](/azure/active-directory/develop/msal-shared-devices) during enrollment. With Shared device mode enabled, these devices allow for single sign-in and sign-out between users across [participating apps](/azure/active-directory/develop/msal-android-shared-devices#microsoft-applications-that-support-shared-device-mode). When the Company Portal app is deployed to devices with this enrollment mode, users also get single sign-out from [apps that have integrated with Intune's SDK](../apps/apps-supported-intune-apps.md), even for apps that don't yet participate with Shared device mode. 

This article describes how to set up and configure Microsoft Intune to enroll dedicated devices. For more information about Android Enterprise management solutions, see [Get started with Android Enterprise](https://support.google.com/work/android/answer/6174145?hl=en&ref_topic=6151012)(opens Android Enterprise Help Center). 

## Device requirements

Devices must have: 

- Android OS version 8.0 or later.
- A distribution of Android that has Google Mobile Services (GMS) connectivity. Devices must have GMS available and must be able to connect to GMS.

## Set up Android Enterprise dedicated device management

To set up Android Enterprise dedicated device management, follow these steps:

1. To prepare to manage mobile devices, you must [set the mobile device management (MDM) authority to **Microsoft Intune**](../fundamentals/mdm-authority-set.md) for instructions. You set this item only once, when you're first setting up Intune for mobile device management.
2. [Connect your Intune tenant account to your Managed Google Play account](connect-intune-android-enterprise.md).
3. [Create an enrollment profile.](#create-an-enrollment-profile)
4. [Create a device group](#create-a-device-group).
5. [Enroll the dedicated devices](#enroll-the-dedicated-devices).

### Create an enrollment profile

> [!NOTE]
> If a token has expired, the profile associated with it will not be displayed in **Device enrollment** > **Android enrollment** > **Corporate-owned dedicated devices**. To see all profiles associated with both active and inactive tokens, click on **Filter** and check the boxes for both "Active" and "Inactive" policy states.

You must create an enrollment profile so that you can enroll your dedicated devices. When the profile is created, it provides you with an enrollment token in the form of a string and QR code.    

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431) and choose **Devices** > **Android** > **Android enrollment** > **Android Enterprise** > **Corporate-owned dedicated devices**.
2. Choose **Create** and fill out the required fields.
    - **Name**: Type a name that you'll use when assigning the profile to the dynamic device group.
    - **Description**: Add a profile description (optional).
    - **Token expiration date**: The date when the token expires. Intune enforces a maximum of 65 years.
    - **Token type**: Choose the type ofÂ token you want to use to enroll dedicated devices.
        - **Corporate-owned dedicated device (default)**: This token enrolls devices as a standard Android Enterprise dedicated device. These devices require no user credentials at any point. This is the default token type that dedicated devices will enroll with unless updated by Admin at time of token creation.
        - **Corporate-owned dedicated device with Microsoft Entra ID shared mode**: This token enrolls devices as a standard Android Enterprise dedicated device and, during enrollment, deploys Microsoft's Authenticator app configured into Microsoft Entra shared device mode. With this option, users can achieve single sign-in and single sign-out across apps on the device that are integrated with the Microsoft Entra Microsoft Authentication Library and global sign-in/sign-out calls.
    - **Token expiration date**: Enter the date you want the token to expire, up to 65 years in the future. The token expires on the selected date at 12:59:59 PM in the time zone it was created. Acceptable date format: `MM/DD/YYYY` or `YYYY-MM-DD`  
3. Choose **Create** to save the profile.  

### Access enrollment token  
There are two ways to access the enrollment token in the admin center.   

The first way: 
1. Choose **Devices** > **Android** > **Android enrollment** > **Android Enterprise** > **Corporate-owned dedicated devices**.
2. From the list, select your enrollment profile. 
2. Select **Token**. 

The second way:
1. Choose **Devices** > **Android** > **Android enrollment** > **Android Enterprise** > **Corporate-owned dedicated devices**.
2. Locate your profile in the list, and then select the **More** (**...**) menu that's next to it.
3. Select **View enrollment token**.  

The token appears as a 20-digit string and a QR code. Use this token to enroll devices via the mechanisms described in [Enroll dedicated, fully managed, or corporate-owned work profile devices](android-dedicated-devices-fully-managed-enroll.md). At the time of enrollment, the device user is prompted for the enrollment token. You can provide the string or QR, as long as it's supported by the Android OS and version of the enrolling device. 
 
### Replace, remove, or export token   

Select a token to access these options:            

- **Replace token**: Generate a new token that's nearing expiration.  
- **Revoke token**: Immediately expire the token. Once revoked, the token is no longer usable. This option is useful if you:  
  - Accidentally share the token with an unauthorized party.    
  - Complete all enrollments and no longer need the token.    
- **Export token**: Export the JSON content of the token. This option is useful for obtaining the JSON content that's needed to configure [Google Zero Touch](android-dedicated-devices-fully-managed-enroll.md#enroll-by-using-google-zero-touch) or [Knox Mobile Enrollment](android-samsung-knox-mobile-enroll.md). 

When applied, these actions don't have any effect on devices that are already enrolled.   

### Create a device group

You can target apps and policies to either assigned or dynamic device groups. You can configure dynamic Microsoft Entra device groups to automatically populate devices that are enrolled with a particular enrollment profile by following these steps:

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431) and choose **Groups** > **All groups** > **New group**.
2. In the **Group** blade, fill out the required fields as follows:
    - **Group type**: Security
    - **Group name**: Type an intuitive name (like Factory 1 devices)
    - **Membership type**: Dynamic device
3. Choose **Add dynamic query**.
4. In the **Dynamic membership rules** blade, fill out the fields as follows:
    - **Add dynamic membership rule**: Simple rule
    - **Add devices where**: enrollmentProfileName
    - In the middle box, choose **Equals**.
    - In the last field, enter the enrollment profile name that you created earlier.
    For more information about dynamic membership rules, see [Dynamic membership rules for groups in Microsoft Entra ID](/azure/active-directory/users-groups-roles/groups-dynamic-membership).
5. Choose **Add query** > **Create**.

## Enroll the dedicated devices

You can now [enroll your dedicated devices](android-dedicated-devices-fully-managed-enroll.md).

> [!NOTE]
> The **Microsoft Intune** app will be automatically installed during enrollment of a dedicated device.  This app is required for enrollment and cannot be uninstalled.
> The **Microsoft Authenticator** app will be automatically installed during enrollment of a dedicated device when using the token type **Corporate-owned dedicated device with Microsoft Entra ID shared mode**. This app is required for this enrollment method and cannot be uninstalled.

## Managing apps on Android Enterprise dedicated devices

Only apps that have Assignment type [set to Required](../apps/apps-deploy.md#assign-an-app) can be installed on Android Enterprise dedicated devices. Apps are installed from the Managed Google Play store in the same manner as Android Enterprise personally owned and corporately owned work profile devices.

Apps are automatically updated on managed devices when the app developer publishes an update to Google Play.

To remove an app from Android Enterprise dedicated devices, you can do either of the following:

- Delete the Required app deployment.
- Create an uninstall deployment for the app.
