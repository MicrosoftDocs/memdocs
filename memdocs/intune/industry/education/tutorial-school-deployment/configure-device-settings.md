# Configure and secure devices with Microsoft Intune

With Intune, you can configure settings for devices in the school, to ensure that they comply with specific policies.
For example, you may need to secure your devices, ensuring that they are kept up to date. Or you may need to configure all the devices with the same look and feel.

Settings can be assigned to groups:

- If you target settings to a **group of users**, those settings apply, regardless of what managed devices the targeted users sign in to
- If you target settings to a **group of devices**, those settings apply regardless of who is using the devices

## Introduction

✅ Learn about the different types of settings

### [Intune](#tab/intune)

Device profiles allow you to add and configure settings, and then push these settings to devices in your organization. You have some options when creating policies:

- **Baselines**: Baselines include preconfigured security settings. If you want to create security policy using recommendations by Microsoft security teams, then security baselines are for you.

  For more information, see [Security baselines](/mem/intune/protect/security-baselines).

- **Settings catalog**: Use the settings catalog to see all the available settings, and in one location. For example, you can see all the settings that apply to BitLocker, and create a policy that just focuses on BitLocker.

  For more information, see [Settings catalog](/mem/intune/configuration/settings-catalog).

- **Templates**: Templates include a logical grouping of settings that configure a feature or concept, such as VPN, email, kiosk devices, and more. If you're familiar with creating device configuration policies in Microsoft Intune, then you're already using these templates.

  For more information, including the available templates, see [Apply features and settings on your devices using device profiles](/mem/intune/configuration/device-profiles).

> [!TIP]
> You can find a list of common configurations used in K-12 organizations at [Common Education configuration overview](/mem/intune/industry/education/tutorial-school-deployment/common-config-overview).

### [Intune For Education](#tab/intune-for-education)

There are two ways to manage settings in Intune for Education:

- **Express Configuration.** This option is used to configure a selection of settings that are commonly used in school environments
- **Group settings.** This option is used to configure all settings offered by Intune for Education

> [!NOTE]
> Express Configuration is ideal when you are getting started. Settings are pre-configured to Microsoft-recommended values, but can be changed to fit your school's needs.

With Express Configuration, you can get Intune for Education up and running in just a few steps. You can select a group of devices or users, select applications to distribute, and choose settings from the most commonly used in schools.

### [Intune](#tab/intune)

It is important to keep iOS devices up to date with the latest security updates. You can create control updates with Intune using three different methods:

- **Option 1** - iOS and iPadOS 17.0 and newer devices (recommended) - [Managed software update policy](/mem/intune/protect/managed-software-updates-ios-macos).
- **Option 2** - iOS and iPadOS 17.0 and older (recommended) - [Software update policy](/mem/intune/protect/software-updates-ios).
- **Option 3** (not recommended) - End users manually install the updates.

At **Devices** > **Manage devices** > **Configuration** > **Create** > **Settings catalog** > **Restrictions**, you can use the following settings to delay how long after an update is released that users can manually install the updates.

- **Defer software updates**: Yes/No
- **Delay default visibility of software updates**: 0-90

> [!TIP]
> The **Settings Catalog** > **Declarative Device Management** > **Software Update** settings take precedence over the **Settings Catalog** > **Restrictions** settings. For more information, go to [Precedence of settings in iOS updates policy](/mem/intune/protect/managed-software-updates-ios-macos).

For more information, see [Software updates planning guide and scenarios for supervised iOS/iPadOS devices in Microsoft Intune](/mem/intune/protect/software-updates-guide-ios-ipados).
