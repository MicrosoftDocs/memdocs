# Enroll devices with Company Portal

If you're setting up an iOS device individually, you can use the Company Portal app to enroll it in Intune.

With this process, no advance preparation is needed. For more information, see [Set up personal iOS device for work or school](/mem/intune/user-help/enroll-your-device-in-intune-ios).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you configured enrollment restrictions in Intune blocking personal iOS devices, this process will not complete. You will need to use a different enrollment method.

## Next steps

With the devices managed by Intune, you can use Intune to maintain them and report on their status.
