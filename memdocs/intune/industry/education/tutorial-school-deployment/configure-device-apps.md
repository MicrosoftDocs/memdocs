# Configure applications with Microsoft Intune

With Intune, school IT administrators have access to diverse applications to help students unlock their learning potential. This section discusses tools and resources for adding apps to Intune.

Applications can be assigned to groups:

- If you target apps to a **group of users**, the apps will be installed on any managed devices that the users sign into.
- If you target apps to a **group of devices**, the apps will be installed on those devices and available to any user who signs in.

## Add apps

✅ Add applications to your inventory

### [Intune](#tab/intune)

Intune supports the deployment several application types including desktop apps (msi, exe), Microsoft Store apps, web apps, appxbundle and MSIX.

#### Enterprise Application Management

Enterprise App Management enables you to easily discover and deploy applications and keep them up to date from the Enterprise App Catalog. The Enterprise App Catalog is a collection of prepared Microsoft and non-Microsoft applications. These apps are Win32 apps that are [prepared as Win32 apps](/mem/intune/apps/apps-win32-prepare) and hosted by Microsoft.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Enterprise App Management is an Intune add-on as part of the Intune suite that is available for trial and purchase. For more information, see [Use Intune Suite add-on capabilities](/mem/intune/fundamentals/intune-add-ons).

For more information, see [Enterprise Application Management](/mem/intune/apps/apps-enterprise-app-management).

#### Win32 apps (MSI, exe)

The addition of desktop applications to Intune should be carried out by repackaging the apps, and defining the commands to silently install them. The process is described in the article [Add, assign, and monitor a Win32 app in Microsoft Intune][MEM-1].

#### Microsoft Store app (new)

1. In **Select app type** pane, select **Microsoft Store app (new)** under the **Store app** section.
1. Choose **Select** at the bottom of the page to begin creating an app from the Microsoft Store. The app creation experience has three steps:

    - Assignments
    - Review + create
1. Select **Search the Microsoft Store app** to search for and select the app.
1. Review and change settings as required.
    > [!NOTE]
    > Most administrators choose to deploy store apps in the **system** context on education devices for the fastest installation to all users of a device.

> [!TIP]
> The best user experience for receiving apps on a device is for apps to be assigned using Apple School Manager and the Volume Purchase Program (VPP) with device licensing. When device-licensed VPP apps are assigned to devices or users, the app can be installed without user interaction. For iOS apps without VPP, the user is prompted to sign in to the App Store with an Apple ID.

### [Intune](#tab/intune)

#### Volume purchase program (VPP) apps

To add apps from VPP, set up a connection to Apple School Manager and add your apps in Apple School Manager.

For more information, see [Configure VPP tokens](/mem/intune/apps/vpp-apps-ios).

#### iOS App

To add apps to iOS devices without using VPP in Intune for Education:

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431).
1. Select **Apps** > **All apps** > **Add**.
1. In the **Select app type** pane, select **iOS store app**.
1. Click **Select**. The **Add app** steps are displayed.
1. Select **Search the App Store**.
1. In the **Search the App Store** pane, select the App Store country/region locale.
1. In the **Search** box, type the name (or part of the name) of the app. Intune searches the store and returns a list of relevant results.
1. In the results list, select the app you want, and then select **Select**.
1. Follow the steps remaining steps and select **Create**.

> [!NOTE]
> Apps installed with this method will require the user of the device to sign in using an Apple ID to install the application. To avoid prompting the user for an Apple ID, use VPP apps.
