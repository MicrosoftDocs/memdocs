# Set up Microsoft Entra ID

The Microsoft platform for education simplifies the management of Windows devices with Intune and Microsoft 365 Education. The first, fundamental step, is to configure the identity infrastructure to manage user access and permissions for your school.

Microsoft Entra ID, which is included with the Microsoft 365 Education subscription, provides authentication and authorization to any Microsoft cloud services. Identity objects are defined in Microsoft Entra ID for human identities, like students and teachers, as well as non-human identities, like devices, services, and applications. With Microsoft 365 licenses, users can consume services and access resources within the tenant. With Microsoft 365 Education, you can manage identities for your teachers and students, assign licenses to devices and users, and create groups for the classrooms.

## Create a Microsoft 365 tenant

If you don't already have a Microsoft 365 tenant, you need to create one.

For more information, see [Create your Office 365 tenant][M365-1].

### Explore the Microsoft 365 admin center

The **Microsoft 365 admin center** is the hub for all administrative consoles for the Microsoft 365 cloud. To access the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com), sign in with the same account when you [created the Microsoft 365 tenant](#create-a-microsoft-365-tenant).

From the Microsoft 365 admin center, you can access different administrative dashboards: Microsoft Entra ID, Microsoft Intune, Intune for Education, and others:

:::image type="content" source="./images/m365-admin-center.png" alt-text="*All admin centers* page in *Microsoft 365 admin center*" lightbox="./images/m365-admin-center.png" border="true":::

For more information, see [Overview of the Microsoft 365 admin center][M365-2].

> [!NOTE]
> Setting up your school's basic cloud infrastructure does not require you to complete the rest of the Microsoft 365 setup. For this reason, we will skip directly to adding students and teachers as users in the Microsoft 365 tenant.

### Set up your domain

You can configure a custom domain so that you can create users and groups with an organization-specific email. For more information, use these links:

- [Add a domain to Microsoft 365](/microsoft-365/admin/setup/add-domain)
- Set your default domain name under **Settings** > **Domain names** > **custom domain**

## Add users, create groups, and assign licenses

With the Microsoft 365 tenant in place, it's time to add users, create groups, and assign licenses. All students and teachers need a user account before they can sign in and access the different Microsoft 365 services. There are multiple ways to do this, including using School Data Sync (SDS), synchronizing an on-premises Active Directory, manually, or both.

> [!NOTE]
> Synchronizing your Student Information System (SIS) with School Data Sync is the preferred way to create students and teachers as users in a Microsoft 365 Education tenant. However, if you want to integrate an on-premises directory and synchronize accounts to the cloud, skip to [Microsoft Entra Connect Sync](#microsoft-entra-connect-sync).

### School Data Sync

✅ Provision users and groups using your SIS data

School Data Sync (SDS) imports and synchronizes SIS data to create classes in Microsoft 365, such as Microsoft 365 groups and class teams in Microsoft Teams. SDS can be used to create new, cloud-only, identities or to evolve existing identities. Users evolve into *students* or *teachers* and are associated with a *grade*, *school*, and other education-specific attributes.

For more information, see [Overview of School Data Sync][SDS-1].

> [!TIP]
> To learn more and practice with School Data Sync, follow the [Microsoft School Data Sync demo](/SchoolDataSync/), which provides detailed steps to access, configure, and deploy School Data Sync in your Microsoft 365 Education tenant.

> [!NOTE]
> You can perform a test deployment by cloning or downloading sample SDS CSV school data from the [O365-EDU-Tools GitHub site](https://github.com/OfficeDev/O365-EDU-Tools).
>
> Remember that you should typically deploy test SDS data (users, groups, and so on) in a separate test tenant, not your school production environment.

### Microsoft Entra Connect Sync

✅ Configure sync between Active Directory and Microsoft Entra ID

To integrate an on-premises directory with Microsoft Entra ID, you can use **Microsoft Entra Connect** to synchronize users, groups, and other objects. Microsoft Entra Connect lets you configure the authentication method appropriate for your school, including:

- [Password hash synchronization][AAD-1]
- [Pass-through authentication][AAD-2]
- [Federated authentication][AAD-3]

For more information, see [Set up directory synchronization for Microsoft 365][O365-1].

### Create users manually

✅ Create users one by one

In addition to the above methods, you can manually add users and groups, and assign licenses through the Microsoft 365 admin center.

There are two options for adding users manually, either individually or in bulk:

1. To add students and teachers as users in Microsoft 365 Education *individually*:
    - Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com).
    - Select **Microsoft Entra ID** > **Users** > **All users** > **New user** > **Create new user**.
    For more information, see [Add users and assign licenses at the same time][M365-3].
1. To add *multiple* users to Microsoft 365 Education:
    - Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com).
    - Select **Microsoft Entra ID** > **Users** > **All users** > **Bulk operations** > **Bulk create**.

For more information, see [Add multiple users in the Microsoft 365 admin center][M365-4].

### Create groups

✅ Organize your users and devices

Creating groups is important to simplify multiple tasks, like assigning licenses, delegating administration, deploy settings, applications or to distribute assignments to students. To create groups:

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com).
1. Select **Microsoft Entra ID** > **Groups** > **All groups** > **New group**.
1. On the **New group** page, select **Group type** > **Security**.
1. Provide a group name and add members, as needed.
1. Select **Next**.

For more information, see [Create a group in the Microsoft 365 admin center][M365-5].

### Assign licenses

✅ Assign licenses to users

The recommended way to assign licenses is through group-based licensing. With this method, Microsoft Entra ID ensures that licenses are assigned to all members of the group. Any new members who join the group are assigned the appropriate licenses, and when members leave, their licenses are removed.

To assign a license to a group:

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com).
1. Select **Microsoft Entra ID** > **Show More** > **Billing** > **Licenses**.
1. Select the required products that you want to assign licenses for > **Assign**.
1. Add the groups to which the licenses should be assigned.

For more information, see [Group-based licensing using Microsoft Entra admin center][AAD-4].

## Configure school branding

✅ Customize your tenant branding

Configuring your school branding enables a more familiar Autopilot experience to students and teachers. With a custom school branding, you can define a custom logo and a welcome message, which is visible during the Windows out-of-box experience (OOBE).

To configure your school's branding:

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com).
1. Select **Microsoft Entra ID** > **Show More** > **User experiences** > **Company branding**.
1. You can specify brand settings like background image, logo, username hint and a sign-in page text.
    :::image type="content" source="images/entra-branding.png" alt-text="Configure Microsoft Entra ID branding from Microsoft Entra admin center." lightbox="images/entra-branding.png":::
1. To adjust the school tenant's name displayed during OOBE, select **Microsoft Entra ID** > **Overview** > **Properties**.
1. In the **Name** field, enter the school district or organization's name > **Save**.
    :::image type="content" alt-text="Configure Microsoft Entra tenant name from Microsoft Entra admin center." source="images/entra-tenant-name.png" lightbox="images/entra-tenant-name.png":::

For more information, see [Add branding to your directory][AAD-5].

## Configure device settings

In this section, you configure Microsoft Entra device settings.

### Enable Microsoft Entra join

✅ Enable Microsoft Entra join and device limits

To allow Microsoft Entra join:

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com).
1. Select **Microsoft Entra ID** > **Devices** > **Device Settings**.
1. Under **Users may join devices to Microsoft Entra ID**, select **All**.
    > [!NOTE]
    > If it is required that only specific users can join devices to Microsoft Entra ID, select **Selected**. If using provisioning packages, ensure that the user account that will create provisioning packages is included in the list of users.
1. You may also want to review the **Maximum number of devices per user** value on this page, which Education customers commonly set to **Unlimited**.
1. Select Save
    :::image type="content" source="images/entra-device-settings.png" alt-text="Configure device settings from Microsoft Entra admin center." lightbox="images/entra-device-settings.png":::

> [!NOTE]
> To create a bulk enrollment token (used by a provisioning package to perform Entra join), you must have a supported Microsoft Entra role assignment and must not be scoped to an administrative unit in Microsoft Entra ID. The supported roles are:
>
> - Global Administrator
> - Cloud Device Administrator
> - Intune Administrator
> - Password Administrator
>
> For more information, see [Give admin permissions in Microsoft Intune admin center](/mem/intune/fundamentals/users-add#give-admin-permissions-in-microsoft-intune-admin-center).
