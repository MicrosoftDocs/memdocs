# Set up Microsoft Intune

Without the proper tools and resources, managing hundreds or thousands of devices in a school environment can be a complex and time-consuming task. Microsoft Intune is a collection of services that simplifies the management of devices at scale.

The Microsoft Intune service can be managed in different ways.

- **Intune admin center** is the primary Intune interface that supports the entire device lifecycle, from the enrollment phase through retirement. IT administrators can manage all settings across all Intune supported platforms.
- **Intune for Education** is a curated view of Intune that supports the entire device lifecycle, from the enrollment phase through retirement. IT administrators can start managing classroom devices with bulk enrollment options and a streamlined deployment. At the end of the school year, IT admins can reset devices, ensuring they're ready for the next year.

    For more information, see [Intune for Education documentation][INT-1].

> [!TIP]
> **Intune** and **Intune for Education** both configure the **Intune** service. Changes made in one console will be reflected in the other. However, **Intune for Education** only supports a subset of policies and apps curated to suit simple K-12 scenarios on Windows and iPadOS.

## Prerequisites

✅ Check out the requirements for device management

Before configuring settings with Intune, consider the following prerequisites:

- **Intune subscription.** Microsoft Intune is licensed in three ways:
  - As a standalone service
  - As part of [Enterprise Mobility + Security][MSFT-1]
  - As part of a [Microsoft 365 Education subscription][MSFT-2]
- **Intune for Education device platforms.** Intune for Education can manage devices running a supported version of Windows 10, Windows 11, Windows 11 SE, and iPadOS
- **Intune device platforms.** Intune can manage devices running a supported version of Windows 10, Windows 11, Windows 11 SE, iOS, iPadOS, macOS, Android, and Linux
- **Network requirements.** Confirm all the required network endpoints can access without SSL inspection or any type of filtering. See [Network endpoints for Microsoft Intune](/mem/intune/fundamentals/intune-endpoints) for a list of endpoints.

For more information, see [Intune licensing][MEM-1] and [this comparison sheet][MSFT-3], which includes a table detailing the *Microsoft Modern Work Plan for Education*.

## Configure the Intune service for Education devices

The Intune service can be configured in different ways, depending on the needs of your school. In this section, you configure the Intune service using settings commonly implemented by K-12 school districts.

### Configure enrollment restrictions

✅ Restrict which devices can be managed

With enrollment restrictions, you control which devices can enroll and be managed by Intune. For example, you can prevent the enrollment of personal devices.

To block personally owned devices from enrolling:

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431).
1. Select **Devices** > **Enroll devices** > **Device platform restrictions**.
1. Select the tab for the platform you want to restrict.
1. Select **Create restriction**.
1. On the **Basics** page, provide a name for the restriction and, optionally, a description > **Next**.
1. On the **Platform settings** page, in the **Personally owned devices** field, select **Block** > **Next**.
    :::image type="content" source="./images/enrollment-restrictions.png" alt-text="This screenshot is of the device enrollment restriction page in Microsoft Intune admin center." lightbox="./images/enrollment-restrictions.png":::
1. Optionally, on the **Scope tags** page, add scope tags > **Next**.
1. On the **Assignments** page, select **Add groups**, and then use the search box to find and choose groups to which you want to apply the restriction > **Next**.
1. On the **Review + create** page, select **Create** to save the restriction.

For more information, see [Create a device platform restriction][MEM-2].

### Optional configuration

✅ Configure optional tenant configuration

- Customize branding according to organization policies. For more information, see [How to configure the Intune Company Portal apps, Company Portal website, and Intune app](/mem/intune/apps/company-portal-app).
- Create Terms and conditions according to organization policies. For more information, see [Terms and conditions for user access](/mem/intune/enrollment/terms-and-conditions-create).

### Configure Windows enrollment

✅ Configure which users can enroll Windows devices

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431).
1. Select **Devices** > **Enroll devices** > **Automatic Enrollment**.
1. Set the **MDM user scope** to **All** or **Some** and select a group if you want to restrict enrollment to certain users.
    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > The MDM user scope must be set to *All* if provisioning pacakges are used to enroll devices.
1. Set **MAM user scope** to **None**.
    :::image type="content" source="./images/intune-windows-enrollment.png" alt-text="A screenshot showing the MDM user scope and MAM user scope." lightbox="./images/intune-windows-enrollment.png":::
1. Select **Save**.

For more information, see [Enable Windows automatic enrollment](/mem/intune/enrollment/windows-enroll#enable-windows-automatic-enrollment).

### Disable Windows Hello for Business

✅ Disable functionality typically inaccessible to students

Windows Hello for Business is a biometric authentication feature that allows users to sign in to their devices using a PIN, password, or fingerprint. Windows Hello for Business is enabled by default on Windows devices, and to set it up, users must perform for multifactor authentication (MFA). As a result, this feature may not be ideal for students, who may not have MFA enabled.

It's common for Windows Hello for Business to be disabled at the tenant level. Then, a policy can be targted at users or devices that need it. For example, staff and teachers.

To disable Windows Hello for Business at the tenant level:

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431).
1. Select **Devices** > **By platform** > **Windows** > **Device onboarding** > **Enrollment**.
1. Select **Windows Hello for Business**.
1. Ensure that **Configure Windows Hello for Business** is set to **disabled**.
1. Select **Save**.

:::image type="content" source="./images/whfb-disable.png" alt-text="Disablement of Windows Hello for Business from Microsoft Intune admin center." lightbox="./images/whfb-disable.png":::

For more information how to enable Windows Hello for Business on specific devices, see [Create a Windows Hello for Business policy][MEM-4].
