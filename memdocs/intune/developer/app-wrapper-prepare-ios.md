# Prepare iOS apps for app protection policies with the Intune App Wrapping Tool

Use the Microsoft Intune App Wrapping Tool for iOS to enable Intune app protection policies for in-house iOS apps without changing the code of the app itself.

The tool is a macOS command-line application that creates a wrapper around an app. Once an app is processed, you can change the app's functionality by deploying [app protection policies](../apps/app-protection-policies.md) to it.

To download the tool, see [Microsoft Intune App Wrapping Tool for iOS](https://github.com/microsoftconnect/intune-app-wrapping-tool-ios) on GitHub.

> [!NOTE]
> If you have issues with using the Intune App Wrapping Tool with your apps, submit a [request for assistance](https://github.com/microsoftconnect/intune-app-wrapping-tool-ios/issues) on GitHub.

## General prerequisites for the App Wrapping Tool

Before you run the App Wrapping Tool, you need to fulfill some general prerequisites:

* Download the [Microsoft Intune App Wrapping Tool for iOS](https://github.com/microsoftconnect/intune-app-wrapping-tool-ios) from GitHub.

* A macOS computer that has the Xcode toolset version 14.0 or later installed.

* The input iOS app must be developed and signed by your company or an independent software vendor (ISV).

  * The input app file must have the extension **.ipa** or **.app**.

  * The input app must be compiled for iOS 14.0 or later.

  * The input app can't be encrypted.

  * The input app can't have extended file attributes.

  * The input app must have entitlements set before being processed by the Intune App Wrapping Tool. [Entitlements](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Miscellaneous/Reference/EntitlementKeyReference/Chapters/AboutEntitlements.html) give the app more permissions and capabilities beyond those typically granted. See [Setting app entitlements](#setting-app-entitlements) for instructions.

<a name='register-your-app-with-azure-ad'></a>

* Make sure valid signing certificates exist in your system keychain. If you have app code-signing issues, use the following steps to resolve:
  * Reset trust settings for all related certificates
  * Install intermediate certificates in the system keychain and sign-in keychain
  * Uninstall and reinstall all related certificates

## Register your app with Microsoft Entra ID

1.	Register your apps with Microsoft Entra ID. For more information, see [Register an application with the Microsoft identity platform](/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app). 
2.	Add the custom redirect URL to your app settings. For more information, see [Configuring MSAL](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-objc#configuring-msal). 
3.	Give your app access to the Intune MAM service. For more information, see [Give your app access to the Intune Mobile App Management service](../developer/app-sdk-get-started.md#give-your-app-access-to-the-intune-mobile-app-management-service). 
4.	Once the above changes are completed, run the latest version of the Intune App Wrapping tool. Configure your apps for Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL): Add the Microsoft Entra application client ID into the command-line parameters with the Intune App Wrapping Tool. For more information, see [Command-line parameters](../developer/app-wrapper-prepare-ios.md#command-line-parameters).

   > [!NOTE]
   > The parameters `-ac` and `-ar` are required parameters. Each app will need a unique set of these parameters. `-aa` is only required for single tenant applications.

5.	Deploy the app.

## Apple Developer prerequisites for the App Wrapping Tool

To distribute wrapped apps exclusively to your organization's users, you need an account with the [Apple Developer Enterprise Program](https://developer.apple.com/programs/enterprise/) and several entities for app signing that are linked to your Apple Developer account.

To learn more about distributing iOS apps internally to your organization's users, read the official guide to [Distributing Apple Developer Enterprise Program Apps](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/IDEs/Conceptual/AppDistributionGuide/DistributingEnterpriseProgramApps/DistributingEnterpriseProgramApps.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40012582-CH33-SW1).

You'll need the following to distribute apps wrapped by Intune:

* A developer account with the Apple Developer Enterprise Program.

* In-house and ad-hoc distribution signing certificate with valid Team Identifier.

  * You'll need the SHA1 hash of the signing certificate as a parameter to the Intune App Wrapping Tool.


* In-house distribution provisioning profile.

## Run the App Wrapping Tool

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Intune regularly releases updates to the Intune App Wrapping Tool. Regularly check the [Intune App Wrapping Tool for iOS](https://github.com/microsoftconnect/intune-app-wrapping-tool-ios) for updates and incorporate into your software development release cycle to ensure your apps support the latest App Protection Policy settings.

### Use terminal

Open the macOS Terminal and run the following command:

```bash
/Volumes/IntuneMAMAppPackager/IntuneMAMPackager/Contents/MacOS/IntuneMAMPackager -i /<path of input app>/<app filename> -o /<path to output folder>/<app filename> -p /<path to provisioning profile> -c <SHA1 hash of the certificate> [-b [<output app build string>]] [-v] [-e] [-x /<array of extension provisioning profile paths>]
```

> [!NOTE]
> Some parameters are optional as shown in the following table.

**Example:** The following example command runs the App Wrapping Tool on the app named MyApp.ipa. A provisioning profile and SHA-1 hash of the signing certificate are specified and used to sign the wrapped app. The output app (MyApp_Wrapped.ipa) is created and stored in your Desktop folder.

```bash
./IntuneMAMPackager/Contents/MacOS/IntuneMAMPackager -i ~/Desktop/MyApp.ipa -o ~/Desktop/MyApp_Wrapped.ipa -p ~/Desktop/My_Provisioning_Profile_.mobileprovision -c "12 A3 BC 45 D6 7E F8 90 1A 2B 3C DE F4 AB C5 D6 E7 89 0F AB"  -v true
```

### Command-line parameters

You can use the following command line parameters with the App Wrapping Tool:

> **Example:** The following example command runs the App Wrapping Tool, incorporating the required commands when wrapping an application for use within a single tenant.
> 
>```bash
>./IntuneMAMPackager/Contents/MacOS/IntuneMAMPackager -i ~/Desktop/MyApp.ipa -o ~/Desktop/MyApp_Wrapped.ipa -p ~/Desktop/My_Provisioning_Profile_.mobileprovision -c "12 A3 BC 45 D6 7E F8 90 1A 2B 3C DE F4 AB C5 D6 E7 89 0F AB" -aa https://login.microsoftonline.com/<tenantID> -ac "Client ID of the input app if the app uses the Microsoft Authentication Library" -ar "Redirect/Reply URI of the input app if the app uses the Microsoft Authentication Library"  -v true
>```


|Property|How to use it|
|---------------|--------------------------------|
|**-i**|`<Path of the input native iOS application file>`. The file name must end in .app or .ipa. |
|**-o**|`<Path of the wrapped output application>` |
|**-p**|`<Path of your provisioning profile for iOS apps>`|
|**-c**|`<SHA1 hash of the signing certificate>`|
|**-h**| Shows detailed usage information about the available command line properties for the App Wrapping Tool. |
|**-ac**|`<Client ID of the input app if the app uses the Microsoft Authentication Library>` This is the GUID in the Client ID field from your app's listing in the App Registration blade. |
|**-ar**|`<Redirect/Reply URI of the input app if the app uses the Microsoft Authentication Library>` This is the Redirect URI configured in your App Registration. Typically it would be the URL protocol of the application that the Microsoft Authenticator app would return to after brokered authentication. |
|**-aa**|(Required for single tenant apps) `<Authority URI of the input app>` i.e `https://login.microsoftonline.com/<tenantID>/` |
|**-v**| (Optional) Outputs verbose messages to the console. It's recommended to use this flag to debug any errors. |
|**-e**| (Optional) Use this flag to have the App Wrapping Tool remove missing entitlements as it processes the app. See [Setting app entitlements](#setting-app-entitlements) for more details.|
|**-xe**| (Optional) Prints information about the iOS extensions in the app and what entitlements are required to use them. See  [Setting app entitlements](#setting-app-entitlements) for more details. |
|**-x**| (Optional) `<An array of paths to extension provisioning profiles>`. Use this if your app needs extension provisioning profiles.|
|**-b**|(Optional) Use -b without an argument if you want the wrapped output app to have the same bundle version as the input app (not recommended). <br/><br/> Use `-b <custom bundle version>` if you want the wrapped app to have a custom CFBundleVersion. If you choose to specify a custom CFBundleVersion, it's a good idea to increment the native app's CFBundleVersion by the least significant component, like 1.0.0 -> 1.0.1. |
|**-f**|(Optional) `<Path to a plist file specifying arguments.>` Use this flag in front of the [plist](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/PropertyLists/Introduction/Introduction.html) file if you choose to use the plist template to specify the rest of the IntuneMAMPackager properties like -i, -o, and -p. See Use a plist to input arguments. |
|**-dt**|(Optional) Disable collection of Microsoft Intune client telemetry.
|**-dl**|(Optional) Disable MSAL logs from the INtune logs for applications that have integrated with MSAL and implement their own MSAL logging callback.

### Use a plist to input arguments

An easy way to run the App Wrapping Tool is to put all the command arguments into a [plist](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/PropertyLists/Introduction/Introduction.html) file. Plist is a file format similar to XML that you can use to input your command line arguments using a form interface.

In the IntuneMAMPackager/Contents/MacOS folder, open `Parameters.plist` (a blank plist template) with a text editor or Xcode. Enter your arguments for the following keys:

| Plist key | Type |  Default Value | Notes |
|------------------|-----|--------------|-----|
| Input Application Package Path |String|empty| Same as -i|
| Output Application Package Path |String|empty| Same as -o|
| Provisioning Profile Path |String|empty| Same as -p|
| SHA-1 Certificate Hash |String|empty| Same as -c|
| MSAL Authority |String|empty| Same as -aa|
| MSAL Client ID |String|empty| Same as -ac|
| MSAL Reply URI |String|empty| Same as -ar|
| Verbose Enabled |Boolean|false| Same as -v|
| Remove Missing Entitlements |Boolean|false| Same as -e|
| Prevent Default Build Update |Boolean|false| Equivalent to using -b without arguments|
| Build String Override |String|empty| The custom CFBundleVersion of the wrapped output app|
| Extension Provisioning Profile Paths |Array of Strings|empty| An array of extension provisioning profiles for the app.
| Disable Telemetry |Boolean|false| Same as -dt
| Disable MSAL Log Override |Boolean|false| Same as -dl

Run the IntuneMAMPackager with the plist as the sole argument:

```bash
./IntuneMAMPackager –f Parameters.plist
```

### Post-wrapping

After the wrapping process completes, the message "The application was successfully wrapped" will be displayed. If an error occurs, see [Error messages](#error-messages-and-log-files) for help.

The wrapped app is saved in the output folder you specified previously. You can upload the app to the Intune admin center and associate it with a mobile application management policy.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When uploading a wrapped app, you can try to update an older version of the app if an older (wrapped or native) version was already deployed to Intune. If you experience an error, upload the app as a new app and delete the older version.

You can now deploy the app to your user groups and target app protection policies to the app. The app will run on the device using the app protection policies you specified.

## How often should I rewrap my iOS application with the Intune App Wrapping Tool?

The main scenarios in which you would need to rewrap your applications are as follows:

* The application itself has released a new version. The previous version of the app was wrapped and uploaded to the Intune admin center.
* The Intune App Wrapping Tool for iOS has released a new version that enables key bug fixes, or new, specific Intune application protection policy features. This happens after 6-8 weeks through GitHub repo for the [Microsoft Intune App Wrapping Tool for iOS](https://github.com/microsoftconnect/intune-app-wrapping-tool-ios).

For iOS/iPadOS, while it's possible to wrap with different cert/provisioning profile than the original used to sign the app, if the entitlements specified in the app aren't included in the new provisioning profile, wrapping will fail. Using the "-e" command-line option, which removes any missing entitlements from the app, to force wrapping to not fail in this scenario can cause broken functionality in the app.

Some best practices for rewrapping include:

* Ensuring that a different provisioning profile has all the required entitlements as any previous provisioning profile. 

## Error messages and log files

Use the following information to troubleshoot issues you have with the app wrapping tool.

### Error messages

If the app wrapping tool fails to finish successfully, one of the following error messages will be displayed in the console:

|Error message|More information|
|-----------------|--------------------|
|You must specify a valid iOS provisioning profile.|Your provisioning profile might not be valid. Check to make sure you have the correct permissions for devices and that your profile is correctly targeting development or distribution. Your provisioning profile might also be expired.|
|Specify a valid input application name.|Make sure that the input application name you specified is correct.|
|Specify a valid path to the output application.|Make sure that the path to the output application you specified exists, and is correct.|
|Specify a valid input provisioning profile.|Make sure you supplied a valid provisioning profile name and extension. Your provisioning profile might be missing entitlements, or you might not have included the –p command line option.|

|WARNING: You didn't specify an SHA1 certificate hash. Make sure that your wrapped application is signed before deploying.|Ensure that you specify a valid SHA1 hash following the –c command line flag. |

### Collecting logs for your wrapped applications from the device
Use the following steps to get logs for your wrapped applications during troubleshooting.

1. Go to the iOS Settings app on your device and select your LOB app.
2. Select **Microsoft Intune**.
3. Toggle the **Display Diagnostics Console** setting to **On**.
4. Launch your LOB application.
5. Click on the "Get Started" link.
6. You can now send logs directly to Microsoft or share them via another application on the device.

> [!NOTE]
> The logging functionality is enabled for apps that have wrapped with the Intune App Wrapping Tool version 7.1.13 or above.

### Collecting crash logs from the system

Your app may be logging useful information to the iOS client device console. This information is useful when you're having problems with the application and need to determine if the issue is related to the App Wrapping Tool or the app itself. To retrieve this information, use the following steps:

1. Reproduce the issue by running the app.

2. Collect the console output by following Apple's instructions for [Debugging Deployed iOS Apps](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/qa/qa1747/_index.html).

Wrapped apps will also present users the option to send logs directly from the device via email after the app crashes. Users can send the logs to you to examine and forward to Microsoft if necessary.

### Certificate, provisioning profile, and authentication requirements

The App Wrapping Tool for iOS has some requirements that must be met in order to guarantee full functionality.

|Requirement|Details|
|---------------|-----------|
|iOS provisioning profile|Make sure that the provisioning profile is valid before you include it. The App Wrapping Tool doesn't check whether the provisioning profile is expired when processing an iOS app. If an expired provisioning profile is specified, the app wrapping tool will include the expired provisioning profile, and you won't know there's a problem until the app fails to install on an iOS device.|
|iOS signing certificate|Make sure that the signing certificate is valid before you specify it. The tool doesn't check whether a certificate is expired when processing iOS apps. If the hash for an expired certificate is provided, the tool will process and sign the app, but it will fail to install on devices.<br /><br />Make sure that the certificate provided for signing the wrapped app has a match in the provisioning profile. The tool doesn't validate if the provisioning profile has a match for the certificate provided for signing the wrapped application.|
|Authentication|A device must have a PIN for encryption to work. On devices to which you have deployed a wrapped app, touching the status bar on the device will require the user to sign in again with a work or school account. The default policy in a wrapped app is *authentication on relaunch*. iOS handles any external notification (like a phone call) by exiting the app and then relaunching it.

## Setting app entitlements

Before wrapping your app, you can grant *[entitlements](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Miscellaneous/Reference/EntitlementKeyReference/Chapters/AboutEntitlements.html)* to give the app additional permissions and capabilities that exceed what an app can typically do. An *entitlement file* is used during code signing to specify special permissions within your app (for example, access to a shared keychain). Specific app services called *capabilities* are enabled within Xcode during app development. Once enabled, the capabilities are reflected in your entitlements file. For more information about entitlements and capabilities, see [Adding Capabilities](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/IDEs/Conceptual/AppDistributionGuide/AddingCapabilities/AddingCapabilities.html) in the iOS Developer Library. For a complete list of supported capabilities, see [Supported capabilities](https://help.apple.com/developer-account/#/dev21218dfd6).

### Supported capabilities for the App Wrapping Tool for iOS

|Capability|Description|Recommended guidance|
|--------------|---------------|------------------------|
|App groups|Use app groups to allow multiple apps to access shared containers and allow additional interprocess communication between apps.<br /><br />To enable app groups, open the **Capabilities** pane and click **ON** in **App Groups**. You can add app groups or select existing ones.|When using App Groups, use reverse DNS notation:<br /><br />*group.com.companyName.AppGroup*|
|Background modes|Enabling background modes lets your iOS app continue running in the background.||
|Data protection|Data protection adds a level of security to files stored on disk by your iOS app. Data protection uses the built-in encryption hardware present on specific devices to store files in an encrypted format on disk. Your app needs to be provisioned to use data protection.||
|In-app purchase|In-app purchase embeds a store directly into your app by enabling you to connect to the store and securely process payments from the user. You can use in-app purchase to collect payment for enhanced functionality or for additional content usable by your app.||
|Keychain sharing|Enabling keychain sharing lets your app share passwords in the keychain with other apps developed by your team.|When using keychain sharing, use reverse DNS notation:<br /><br />*com.companyName.KeychainGroup*|
|Personal VPN|Enable personal VPN to allow your app to create and control a custom system VPN configuration using the Network Extension framework.||
|Push notifications|Apple Push Notification service (APNs) lets an app that isn't running in the foreground notify the user that it has information for the user.|For push notifications to work, you need to use an app-specific provisioning profile.<br /><br />Follow the steps in the [Apple developer documentation](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/IDEs/Conceptual/AppDistributionGuide/AddingCapabilities/AddingCapabilities.html).|
|Wireless accessory configuration|Enabling wireless accessory configuration adds the External Accessory framework to your project and lets your app set up MFi Wi-Fi accessories.||

### Steps to enable entitlements

1. Enable capabilities in your app:

    a.  In Xcode, go to your app's target, and click **Capabilities**.

    b.  Turn on the appropriate capabilities. For detailed information about each capability and how to determine the correct values, see [Adding Capabilities](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/IDEs/Conceptual/AppDistributionGuide/AddingCapabilities/AddingCapabilities.html) in the iOS Developer Library.

    c.  Note any IDs that you created during the process. These may also be referred to as the `AppIdentifierPrefix` values.

    d.  Build and sign your app to be wrapped.

2. Enable entitlements in your provisioning profile:

    a.  Sign in to the Apple Developer Member Center.

    b.  Create a provisioning profile for your app. For instructions, see [How to Obtain the Prerequisites for the Intune App Wrapping Tool for iOS](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/enterprisemobility/2015/02/25/how-to-obtain-the-prerequisites-for-the-intune-app-wrapping-tool-for-ios/).

    c.  In your provisioning profile, enable the same entitlements that you have in your app. You'll need to supply the same IDs (the `AppIdentifierPrefix` values) that you specified during the development of your app. 

    d.  Finish the provisioning profile wizard and download your file.

3. Ensure that you have satisfied all the prerequisites, and then wrap the app.

### Troubleshoot common errors with entitlements

If the App Wrapping Tool for iOS shows an entitlement error, try the following troubleshooting steps.

|Issue|Cause|Resolution|
|---------|---------|--------------|
|Failed to parse entitlements generated from the input application.|The App Wrapping Tool can't read the entitlements file that was extracted from the app. The entitlements file might be malformed.|Inspect the entitlements file for your app. The following instructions explain how to do so. When inspecting the entitlements file, check for any malformed syntax. The file should be in XML format.|
|Entitlements are missing in the provisioning profile (missing entitlements are listed). Repackage the app with a provisioning profile that has these entitlements.|There's a mismatch between the entitlements enabled in the provisioning profile and the capabilities enabled in the app. This mismatch also applies to the IDs associated with particular capabilities (like app groups and keychain access).|Generally, you can create a new provisioning profile that enables the same capabilities as the app. When IDs between the profile and app don't match, the App Wrapping Tool will replace the IDs if it's able to. If you still get this error after creating a new provisioning profile, you can try  removing entitlements from the app by using the –e parameter (see Using the –e parameter to remove entitlements from an app section).|

### Find the existing entitlements of a signed app

To review the existing entitlements of a signed app and provisioning profile:

1. Find the .ipa file and change its extension to .zip.

2. Expand the .zip file. This will produce a Payload folder containing your .app bundle.

3. Use the codesign tool to check the entitlements on the .app bundle, where `YourApp.app` is the actual name of your .app bundle.:

    ```bash
    codesign -d --entitlements :- "Payload/YourApp.app"
    ```

4. Use the security tool to check the entitlements of the app's embedded provisioning profile, where `YourApp.app` is the actual name of your .app bundle.

    ```bash
    security cms -D -i "Payload/YourApp.app/embedded.mobileprovision"
    ```

### Remove entitlements from an app by using the –e parameter

This command removes any enabled capabilities in the app that aren't in the entitlements file. If you remove capabilities that are being used by the app, it can break your app. An example of where you might remove missing capabilities is in a vendor-produced app that has all capabilities by default.

```bash
./IntuneMAMPackager/Contents/MacOS/IntuneMAMPackager –i /<path of input app>/<app filename> -o /<path to output folder>/<app filename> –p /<path to provisioning profile> –c <SHA1 hash of the certificate> -e
```

## Security and privacy for the App Wrapping Tool

Use the following security and privacy best practices when you use the App Wrapping Tool.

- The signing certificate, provisioning profile, and the line-of-business app you specify must be on the same macOS machine that you use to run the app wrapping tool. If the files are on a UNC path, ensure that these are accessible from the macOS machine. The path must be secured via IPsec or SMB signing.

    The wrapped application imported into the admin center should be on the same computer that you run the tool on. If the file is on a UNC path, ensure that it's accessible on the computer running the admin center. The path must be secured via IPsec or SMB signing.

- The environment where the App Wrapping Tool is downloaded from the GitHub repository needs to be secured via IPsec or SMB signing.

- The app you process must come from a trustworthy source to ensure protection against attacks.

- Ensure that the output folder you specify in the App Wrapping Tool is secured, particularly if it's a remote folder.

- iOS apps that include a file upload dialog box can allow users to circumvent, cut, copy, and paste restrictions applied to the app. For example, a user could use the file upload dialog box to upload a screenshot of the app data.

- When you monitor the documents folder on your device from within a wrapped app, you might see a folder named .msftintuneapplauncher. If you change or delete this file, it might affect the correct functioning of restricted apps.

- Registering custom URL schemes allows specific URLs to redirect into your app. iOS and iPadOS allow multiple apps to register the same custom URL scheme and the OS determines which application is invoked. Refer to the Apple documentation [Defining a custom URL scheme for your app](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/defining-a-custom-url-scheme-for-your-app) for recommendations to help avoid custom URL scheme collisions and security guidelines for handling malformed URLs.
