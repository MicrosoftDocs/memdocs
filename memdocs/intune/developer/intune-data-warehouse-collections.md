## deviceConfigurationProfileDeviceActivities
The **DeviceConfigurationProfileDeviceActivity** entity lists the number of devices in the succeeded, pending, failed, or error state per day. The number reflects the Device configuration profiles assigned to the entity. For example, if a device is in the succeeded state for all its assigned policies, it increments the succeeded counter up one for that day. If a device has two profiles assigned to it, one in the succeeded state and another in an error state, the entity increments the Succeeded counter and place the device in the error state. The entity lists how many devices are in which state on a given day over the last 30 days.

## deviceConfigurationProfileUserActivities 
The **DeviceConfigurationProfileUserActivity** entity lists the number of users in the succeeded, pending, failed, or error state per day. The number reflects the Device configuration profiles assigned to the entity. For example, if a user is in the succeeded state for all their assigned policies, it moves up the succeeded counter by one for that day. If a user has two profiles assigned to them, one in the succeeded state and the other is in an error state, the user in the error state is counted. The **DeviceConfigurationProfileUserActivity** entity lists how many users are in which state on a given day over the last 30 days.

## policyDeviceActivities
The following table lists the number of devices in the succeeded, pending, failed, or error state per day. The number reflects the data per Policy Type profiles. For example, if a device is in the succeeded state for all its assigned policies, it increments the succeeded counter up one for that day. If a device has two profiles assigned to it, one in the succeeded state and another in an error state, the entity increments the Succeeded counter and place the device in the error state. The **policyDeviceActivity** entity lists how many devices are in which state on a given day over the last 30 days.

## policyTypes
The **PolicyType** entity lists types of device configuration profiles, app configuration profiles, and Compliance policies. You can assign the policies with Mobile Device Management (MDM) to a group in your enterprise.

|    Property    |                       Description                      |            Example            |

## policyUserActivities
The following table lists the number of users in the succeeded, pending, failed, or error state per day. The number reflects the data per Policy Type profiles. For example, if a user is in the succeeded state for all their assigned policies, it moves up the succeeded counter by one for that day. If a user has two profiles assigned to them, one in the succeeded state and the other is in an error state, the user in the error state is counted. The **PolicyUserActivity** entity lists how many users are in which state on a given day over the last 30 days.

## users
The **user** entity lists all the Microsoft Entra users with assigned licenses in your enterprise.

The **user** entity collection contains user data. These records include user states during the data collection period, even if the user has been removed. For example, a user may be added to Intune and then removed during the course of the last month. While this user is not present at the time of the report, the user and state are present in the data from the prior month. You could create a report that would show the duration of the user's historic presence in your data.
