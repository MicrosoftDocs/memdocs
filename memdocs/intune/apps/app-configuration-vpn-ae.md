# Use a VPN and per-app VPN policy on Android Enterprise devices in Microsoft Intune

Virtual private networks (VPN) allow users to access organization resources remotely, including from home, hotels, cafes, and more. In Microsoft Intune, you can configure VPN client apps on Android Enterprise devices using an app configuration policy. Then, deploy this policy with its VPN configuration to devices in your organization.

You can also create VPN policies that are used by specific apps. This feature is called per-app VPN. When the app is active, it can connect to the VPN, and access resources through the VPN. When the app isn't active, the VPN isn't used.

This feature applies to:

- Android Enterprise

There are two ways to build the app configuration policy for your VPN client app:

- Configuration designer
- JSON data

This article shows you how to create a per-app VPN and VPN app configuration policy using both options.

> [!NOTE]
> Many of the VPN client configuration parameters are similar. But, each app has its unique keys and options. Consult with your VPN vendor if you have questions.

## Before you begin

- Android doesn't automatically trigger a VPN client connection when an app opens. The VPN connection must be started manually. Or, you can use [always-on VPN](../configuration/vpn-settings-android-enterprise.md) to start the connection.

- The following VPN clients support Intune app configuration policies:

  - Cisco AnyConnect
  - Citrix SSO
  - F5 Access
  - Palo Alto Networks GlobalProtect
  - Pulse Secure
  - SonicWall Mobile Connect

- When you create the VPN policy in Intune, you'll select different keys to configure. These key names vary with the different VPN client apps. So, the key names in your environment may be different than the examples in this article.

- The Configuration designer and JSON data can successfully use certificate-based authentication. If VPN authentication requires client certificates, then create the certificate profiles before you create the VPN policy. The VPN app configuration policies use the values from the certificate profiles.

  Android Enterprise personally-owned work profile devices support SCEP and PKCS certificates. Android Enterprise fully managed, dedicated, and corporate-owned work profile devices only support SCEP certificates. For more information, see [Use certificates for authentication in Microsoft Intune](../protect/certificates-configure.md).

## Per-app VPN overview

When creating and testing per-app VPN, the basic flow includes the following steps:

1. Select the VPN client application. [Before you begin](#before-you-begin) (in this article) lists the supported apps.
2. Get the application package IDs of the apps that will use the VPN connection. [Get the app package ID](#get-the-app-package-id) (in this article) shows you how.
3. If you use certificates to authenticate the VPN connection, then create and deploy the certificate profiles before you deploy the VPN policy. Make sure the certificate profiles deploy successfully. For more information, see [Use certificates for authentication in Microsoft Intune](../protect/certificates-configure.md).
4. Add the [VPN client application](apps-add-android-for-work.md) to Intune, and deploy the app to your users and devices.
5. Create the VPN app configuration policy. Use the app package IDs and certificate information in the policy.
6. Deploy the new VPN policy.
7. Confirm the VPN client app successfully connects to your VPN server.
8. When the app is active, confirm that traffic from your app successfully goes through the VPN.

## Get the app package ID

Get the package ID for each application that will use the VPN. For publicly available applications, you can get the app package ID in the Google Play store. The displayed URL for each application includes the package ID.

In the following example, the package ID of the Microsoft Edge browser app is `com.microsoft.emmx`. The package ID is part of the URL:

:::image type="content" source="./media/app-configuration-vpn-ae/app-configuration-vpn-ae-01.png" alt-text="Get the app package ID in the URL on Google Play store.":::

For Line of Business (LOB) apps, get the package ID from the vendor or application developer.

## Certificates

This article assumes your VPN connection uses certificate-based authentication. It also assumes you successfully deployed all the certificates in the chain needed for clients to successfully authenticate. Typically, this certificate chain includes the client certificate, any intermediate certificates, and the root certificate.

For more information on certificates, see [Use certificates for authentication in Microsoft Intune](../protect/certificates-configure.md).

When your client authentication certificate profile is deployed, it creates a certificate token in the certificate profile. This token is used to create the VPN app configuration policy.

If youâ€™re not familiar with creating app configuration policies, see [Add app configuration policies for managed Android Enterprise devices](app-configuration-policies-use-android.md).

## Use the Configuration Designer

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431).
2. Select **Apps** > **App configuration policies** > **Add** > **Managed devices**.
3. In **Basics**, enter the following properties:

    - **Name**: Enter a descriptive name for the policy. Name your policies so you can easily identify them later. For example, a good policy name is **App config policy: Cisco AnyConnect VPN policy for Android Enterprise work profile devices**.
    - **Description**: Enter a description for the policy. This setting is optional, but recommended.
    - **Platform**: Select **Android Enterprise**.
    - **Profile type**: Your options:
      - **All Profile Types**: This option supports username and password authentication. If you use certificate-based authentication, don't use this option.
      - **Fully Managed, Dedicated, and Corporate-Owned Work Profile Only**: This option supports certificate-based authentication, and username and password authentication.
      - **Personally-Owned Work Profile Only**: This option supports certificate-based authentication, and username and password authentication.
    - **Targeted app**: Select the VPN client app you previously added. In the following example, the Cisco AnyConnect VPN client app is used:

      :::image type="content" source="./media/app-configuration-vpn-ae/app-configuration-vpn-ae-02.png" alt-text="Create an app configuration policy to configure VPN or per-app VPN in Microsoft Intune":::

4. Select **Next**.
5. In **Settings**, enter the following properties:

    - **Configuration settings format**: Select **Use Configuration designer**:

      :::image type="content" source="./media/app-configuration-vpn-ae/app-configuration-vpn-ae-03.png" alt-text="Create an app configuration VPN policy in Microsoft Intune using Configuration Designer - example.":::

    - **Add**: Shows the list of configuration keys. Select all the configuration keys needed for your configuration > **OK**.

      In the following example, we selected a minimal list for AnyConnect VPN, including certificate-based authentication and per-app VPN:
  
      :::image type="content" source="./media/app-configuration-vpn-ae/app-configuration-vpn-ae-04.png" alt-text="Add configuration keys to a VPN app configuration policy in Microsoft Intune using Configuration Designer - example.":::

    - **Configuration value**: Enter the values for the configuration keys you selected. Remember, the key names vary depending on the VPN Client app you're using. In the keys selected in our example:

      - **Per App VPN Allowed Apps**: Enter the application package ID(s) you collected earlier. For example:

        :::image type="content" source="./media/app-configuration-vpn-ae/app-configuration-vpn-ae-06.png" alt-text="Enter the allowed app package IDs to a VPN app configuration policy in Microsoft Intune using the Configuration Designer - example.":::

      - **KeyChain Certificate Alias** (optional): Change the **Value type** from **string** to **certificate**. Select the client certificate profile to use with VPN authentication. For example:

        :::image type="content" source="./media/app-configuration-vpn-ae/app-configuration-vpn-ae-07.png" alt-text="Change the KeyChain client certificate alias in a VPN app configuration policy in Microsoft Intune using the Configuration Designer - example.":::

      - **Protocol**: Select the **SSL** or **IPsec** tunnel protocol of the VPN.
      - **Connection Name**: Enter a user friendly name for the VPN connection. Users see this connection name on their devices. For example, enter `ContosoVPN`.
      - **Host**: Enter the host name URL to the headend router. For example, enter `vpn.contoso.com`.

        :::image type="content" source="./media/app-configuration-vpn-ae/app-configuration-vpn-ae-05.png" alt-text="Protocol, connection name, and host name examples in a VPN app configuration policy in Microsoft Intune using the Configuration Designer":::

6. Select **Next**.
7. In **Assignments**, select the groups to assign the VPN app configuration policy.

    Select **Next**.

8. In **Review + create**, review your settings. When you select **Create**, your changes are saved, and the policy is deployed to your groups. The policy is also shown in the app configuration policies list.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/app-configuration-vpn-ae/app-configuration-vpn-ae-08.png" alt-text="Review the app configuration policy using the Configuration Designer Flow in Microsoft Intune example.":::

## Use JSON

Use this option if you don't have, or don't know all the required VPN settings used in the **Configuration designer**. If you need help, consult your VPN vendor.

### Get the certificate token

In these steps, create a temporary policy. The policy won't be saved. The intent is to copy the certificate token. You'll use this token when creating the VPN policy using JSON (next section).

1. In the [Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431), select **Apps** > **App configuration policies** > **Add** > **Managed devices**.
2. In **Basics**, enter the following properties:

    - **Name**: Enter any name. This policy is temporary, and won't be saved.
    - **Platform**: Select **Android Enterprise**.
    - **Profile type**: Select **Personally-Owned Work Profile Only**.
    - **Targeted app**: Select the VPN client app you previously added.

3. Select **Next**.
4. In **Settings**, enter the following properties:

    - **Configuration settings format**: Select **Use configuration designer**.
    - **Add**: Shows the list of configuration keys. Select any key with a **Value type** of **string**. Select **OK**.

      :::image type="content" source="./media/app-configuration-vpn-ae/app-configuration-vpn-ae-11.png" alt-text="In Configuration designer, select any key with a string value type in Microsoft Intune VPN app configuration policy":::

5. Change the **Value type** from **string** to **certificate**. This step lets you select the correct client certificate profile that authenticates the VPN:

    :::image type="content" source="./media/app-configuration-vpn-ae/app-configuration-vpn-ae-12.png" alt-text="Change the connection name in a VPN app configuration policy in Microsoft Intune example":::

6. Immediately change the **Value type** back to **string**. The **Configuration value** changes to a token `{{cert:GUID}}`:

    :::image type="content" source="./media/app-configuration-vpn-ae/app-configuration-vpn-ae-13.png" alt-text="The configuration value shows the certificate token in a VPN app configuration policy in Microsoft Intune":::

7. Copy and paste this certificate token to another file, such as a text editor.

8. Discard this policy. Don't save it. The only purpose is to copy and paste the certificate token.

### Create the VPN policy using JSON

1. In the [Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431), select **Apps** > **App configuration policies** > **Add** > **Managed devices**.

2. In **Basics**, enter the following properties:

    - **Name**: Enter a descriptive name for the policy. Name your policies so you can easily identify them later. For example, a good policy name is **App config policy: JSON Cisco AnyConnect VPN policy for Android Enterprise work profile devices in entire company**.
    - **Description**: Enter a description for the policy. This setting is optional, but recommended.
    - **Platform**: Select **Android Enterprise**.
    - **Profile type**: Your options:
      - **All profile types**: This option supports username and password authentication. If you use certificate-based authentication, don't use this option.
      - **Fully Managed, Dedicated, and Corporate-Owned work profile only**: This option supports certificate-based authentication, and username and password authentication.
      - **Personally-Owned Work Profile Only**: This option supports certificate-based authentication, and username and password authentication.
    - **Targeted app**: Select the VPN client app you previously added. 

3. Select **Next**.
4. In **Settings**, enter the following properties:

    - **Configuration settings format**: Select **Enter JSON data**. You can edit the JSON directly.
    - **Download JSON template**: Use this option to download, and update the template in any external editor. Be careful with text editors that use **Smart quotes**, as they may create invalid JSON.

    After you enter the values needed for your configuration, remove all settings that have `"STRING_VALUE"` or `STRING_VALUE`.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/app-configuration-vpn-ae/app-configuration-vpn-ae-14.png" alt-text="Example of using the JSON Flow - Edit JSON.":::

5. Select **Next**.
6. In **Assignments**, select the groups to assign the VPN app configuration policy.

    Select **Next**.

7. In **Review + create**, review your settings. When you select **Create**, your changes are saved, and the policy is deployed to your groups. The policy is also shown in the app configuration policies list.
