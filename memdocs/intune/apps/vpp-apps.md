# Manage volume-purchased apps and books with Microsoft Intune

[!INCLUDE [azure_portal](../includes/azure_portal.md)]

## Introduction

Some app stores give you the ability to purchase multiple licenses for an app or books that you want to use in your company. Buying licenses in bulk can help you reduce the administrative overhead of tracking multiple purchased copies of apps and books.

Microsoft Intune helps you manage apps and books that you purchased through such a program. You import license information from the store, and track how many licenses you have used. This process helps to ensure that you don't install more copies of the app or book than you own.

## Which types of apps and books can you manage?

With Intune, you can manage apps and books that you purchased in volume from the iOS store, and manage apps that you purchased from the Microsoft Store for Business. To discover how to manage licensed apps from each store, choose one of the following topics:
