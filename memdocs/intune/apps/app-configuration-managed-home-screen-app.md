# Configure the Microsoft Managed Home Screen app for Android Enterprise

The Managed Home Screen is the application used for corporate-owned Android Enterprise dedicated devices and fully managed user affiliated devices enrolled via Intune and running in multi-app kiosk mode. For these devices, the Managed Home Screen acts as the launcher for other approved apps to run on top of it. The Managed Home Screen provides IT admins the ability to customize their devices and to restrict the capabilities that the end user can access. For even more details, see [How to setup Microsoft Managed Home Screen on Dedicated devices in multi-app kiosk mode](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/intune-customer-success/how-to-setup-microsoft-managed-home-screen-on-dedicated-devices/ba-p/1388060).

## When to configure the Microsoft Managed Home Screen app

First, ensure that your devices are supported. Intune supports the enrollment of Android Enterprise dedicated devices and fully managed devices running OS version 8.0 and above that reliably connect to Google Mobile Services. Similarly, Managed Home Screen supports Android devices running OS version 8.0 and above. 

Typically, if settings are available to you through device configuration profiles (**Devices** > **Manage devices** > **Configuration**), configure the settings there. Doing so will save you time, minimize errors, and will give you a better Intune-support experience. However, some of the Managed Home Screen settings are currently only available via the **App configuration policies** pane in the Intune admin center. Use this document to learn how to configure the different settings either using the configuration designer or a JSON script. Additionally, use this document to learn what Managed Home Screen settings are available using device configuration profiles. You may also see [Device settings](../configuration/device-restrictions-android-for-work.md#device-experience) for a full list of settings available in **Devices** > **Manage devices** > **Configuration** that impact the Managed Home Screen. 

If using App configuration, navigate to the [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431) and select **Apps** > **App configuration policies**. Add a configuration policy for **Managed devices** running **Android** and choose **Managed Home Screen** as the associated app. Select **Configuration settings** to configure the different available Managed Home Screen settings. 

## Choosing a Configuration Settings Format

There are two methods that you can use to define configuration settings for Managed Home Screen:

- **Configuration designer** allows you to configure settings with an easy-to-use UI that lets you toggle features on or off and set values. In this method, there are a few disabled configuration keys with value type `BundleArray`. These configuration keys can only be configured by entering JSON data. 
- **JSON data** allows you to define all possible configuration keys using a JSON script. 

If you add properties with Configuration Designer, you can automatically convert these properties to JSON by selecting **Enter JSON data** from the **Configuration settings format** dropdown.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Managed Home Screen app has been updated at the API level to better adhere with the Google Play Store's requirements. In doing so, there were some changes to how Wi-Fi configuration works from Managed Home Screen. The changes include the following: 
> - Being unable to change (enable or disable) the Wi-Fi connection for the device. Users will be able to switch between networks, but will not be able to turn on/off Wi-Fi.
> - Being unable to automatically connect to a configured Wi-Fi network that requires a password for the first time. The configured network will automatically connect after you enter the password the first time.
> 
> On Android devices running OS 11, when an end-user tries to connect to a network via the Managed Home Screen app, they will get prompted with a consent pop-up. This pop-up comes from the Android platform, and is not specific to the Managed Home Screen app. Additionally, when an end-user tries to connect to a password protected network via the Managed Home Screen app, they will be asked to input the password. Even if the password is correct, the network will only change if the device is not connected to a network. Devices that are already connected to a stable network will not be able connect to a password protected network via the Managed Home Screen app.
> 
> On Android devices running OS 10, when an end-user tries to connect to a network via the Managed Home Screen app, they will get prompted with a consent via notifications. Because of this prompt, users on OS 10 will need to have access to the status bar and notifications in order to complete the consent step. Use the [General settings for fully managed and dedicated devices](../configuration/device-restrictions-android-for-work.md#dedicated-devices) to make status bar and notifications available to your end-users, if appropriate. Additionally, when an end-user tries to connect to a password protected network via the Managed Home Screen app, they will be asked to input the password. Even if the password is correct, the network will only change if the device is not already connected to a stable network.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> End users cannot automatically connect to Enterprise Wi-Fi networks they select from the MHS settings menu, even if that network has been pre-configured using either Intune or another external source. While managed devices can still reliably utilize these networks, end users cannot initialize a connection from within MHS to the preconfigured networks.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For devices running on Android 10+ and using Managed Home Screen, for Bluetooth pairing to successfully work on devices that require a pairing key, admins must enable the following Android system apps:
> - Android System Bluetooth
> - Android System Settings
> - Android System UI
>
> For more information on how to enable Android system apps, go to: [Manage Android Enterprise system apps](apps-ae-system.md#enable-a-system-app-in-intune)

> [!NOTE]
> The virtual home button requires granting overlay permission to MHS. The notification badge functionality requires granting notification permission to MHS.The brightness slider, adaptive brightness toggle, and autorotate toggle require granting write settings permission to MHS. Users will be prompted for permission upon startup of MHS, which requires the use of the Settings application. When possible, it is recommended to use OEMconfig to auto-grant these permissions to prevent possible breakout scenarios from the Settings application.

If set to false, device screen will show screen saver   according to value set in inactive_time_to_show_screen_saver. | ✔️ |

> [!NOTE] 
> Managed Home Screen will start the screensaver whenever the lock screen appears. If the system's lock screen timeout is longer than **Screensaver show time** then the 
> screen saver will show until the lock screen appears. If the system's lock screen timeout is shorter than **inactive time to enable screen saver** the screensaver will appear
> as soon as the device's lock screen appears.

> [!NOTE]
> The screensaver requires granting overlay permission and exact alarm permission (OS 14+) to MHS. Users will be prompted for permission upon startup of MHS, which requires the use of the Settings application.

> [!NOTE]
> Managed Home Screen uses the exact alarm permission to do the following actions:
> - Automatically sign users out after a set time of inactivity on the device
> - Launch a screen saver after a set period of inactivity
> - Automatically relaunch MHS after a certain period of time when a user exits kiosk mode
> 
> For devices running Android 14 and higher, by default, the exact alarm permission will be denied. To make sure critical user functionality is not impacted, end-users will be prompted to grant exact alarm permission upon first launch of Managed Home Screen.

> [!NOTE]
> The automatic sign out feature requires granting overlay permission and exact alarm permission (OS 14+) to MHS. Users will be prompted for permission upon startup of MHS, which requires the use of the Settings application. When possible, it is recommended to use OEMconfig to auto-grant overlay and exact alarm permission to prevent possible breakout scenarios from the Settings application.

## Enter JSON Data

Enter JSON data to configure all available settings for Managed Home Screen, and the settings disabled in **Configuration Designer**.

:::image type="content" alt-text="Screenshot of added JSON data" source="./media/app-configuration-managed-home-screen-app/app-configuration-managed-home-screen-app_03.png":::

In addition to the list of configurable settings listed in the **Configuration Designer** table (above), the following table provides the configuration keys you can only configure via JSON data.

|    Configuration   Key    |    Value   Type    |    Default   Value    |    Description    |
|-|-|-|-|
|    Set allow-listed applications    |    bundleArray    | <img alt="JSON - Example 1" src="./media/app-configuration-managed-home-screen-app/defaultvaluejson01.png" width="300"> |    Allows you to define the set of   apps visible on the home screen from all the apps installed on the   device. You can define the apps by entering the app package name of the apps   that you want to make visible. For example, `com.android.settings` would make settings accessible on the home screen. The apps that you allow-list in this section   should already be installed on the device to be visible on the home   screen.    |
|    Set pinned web links    |    bundleArray    | <img alt="JSON - Example 2" src="./media/app-configuration-managed-home-screen-app/defaultvaluejson02.png" width="300"> |    Allows you to pin websites as   quick launch icons on the home screen. With this configuration, you can define   the URL and add it to the home screen for the end user to launch in the   browser with a single tap. Note: We recommend that you create, assign, and approve [Managed Google Play web links](./apps-add-android-for-work.md#managed-google-play-web-links) to your devices. When you do, they're treated like allow-listed applications.    |
|    Create Managed Folder for grouping   apps    |    bundleArray    | <img alt="JSON - Example 3" src="./media/app-configuration-managed-home-screen-app/defaultvaluejson03.png" width="300"> |    Allows you to create and name   folders and group apps within these folders. End users can't move folders, rename the folders, or move the apps within the folders.   Folders will appear in the order created, and apps within the folders will   appear alphabetically.         Note: all apps that you want to   group into folders must be assigned as required to the device and must have   been added to the Managed Home Screen.     |

## Managed Home Screen debug screen
You can access the Managed Home Screen's debug screen by selecting the **back** button until the debug screen is displayed (select the **back** button 15 times or more). From this debug screen, you can launch the Android Device Policy application, view and upload logs, or temporarily pause kiosk mode to update the device. For more information about pausing kiosk mode, see the **Leave kiosk mode** item in the Android Enterprise [fully managed and dedicated devices settings](../configuration/device-restrictions-android-for-work.md#device-experience). If you would like an easier way to access Managed Home Screen's debug screen, you can enable the **Quick access to debug menu** setting using device configuration policies or you can set the **Enable easy access debug menu** to `True` using application configuration policies.
