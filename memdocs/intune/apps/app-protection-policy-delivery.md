# Understand App Protection Policy delivery timing

Learn the different deployment windows for app protection policies to understand when changes should appear on your end-user devices.

## Delivery timing summary

Application protection policy delivery depends on the license state and Intune service registration for your users.  

|    User State    |    App Protection behavior     |    Retry Interval  (see note)    |    Why does this happen?    |
|-----------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|    Tenant Not   Onboarded    |    Wait for   next retry interval.  App Protection is   not active for the user.    |    24   hours    |    Occurs   when you have not setup your tenant for Intune.    |
|    User Not   Licensed     |    Wait for next   retry interval.  App Protection is not active   for the user.     |    12 hours - However, on Android devices this interval requires Intune APP SDK version 5.6.0 or later. Otherwise for Android devices, the interval is 24 hours.   |    Occurs when you   have not licensed the user for Intune.    |
|    User Not   Assigned App Protection Policies    |    Wait for   next retry interval.  App Protection is   not active for the user.    |    12 hours        |    Occurs when you   have not assigned APP settings to the user.    |
|    User Assigned App Protection Policies but app is not defined in the App Protection Policies   |    Wait for   next retry interval.  App Protection is   not active for the user.    |    12 hours        |    Occurs when you   have not added the app to APP.    |
|    User   Successfully Registered for Intune MAM    |    App   Protection is applied per policy settings.    Updates occur based on retry interval    |    Intune   Service defined based on user load.    Typically 30 mins.     |    Occurs when   the user has successfully registered with the Intune service for MAM   configuration.    |

> [!NOTE]
> Retry intervals may require active app use to occur, meaning the app is launched and in use.  If the retry interval is 24 hours and the user waits 48 hours to launch the app, the Application Protection client will retry at 48 hours.

## Handling network connectivity issues

When user registration fails due to network connectivity issues an accelerated retry interval is used.  The Application Protection client will retry at increasingly longer intervals until the interval reaches 60 minutes or a successful connection is made.  The client will then continue to retry at 60 minute intervals until a successful connection is made. Then, the client will return to the standard retry interval based on the user state.
