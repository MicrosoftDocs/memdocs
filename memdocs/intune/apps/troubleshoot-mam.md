# Troubleshoot mobile application management

This topic provides solutions to common problems that have occurred when using Intune App Protection (also referred to as MAM or mobile application management).

If this information does not solve your problem, see [How to get support for Microsoft Intune](../fundamentals/get-support.md) to find more ways to get help.

## Common IT administrator issues

These are common issues an IT administrator may experience when using Intune app protection policies.

| Issue | Description | Resolution |
| -- | -- | -- |
| Policy not applied to Skype for Business | App protection policy without device enrollment, made in the Azure portal, is not applying to the Skype for Business app on iOS/iPadOS and Android devices. | Skype for Business must be set up for modern authentication.  Please follow instructions in [Enable your tenant for modern authentication](https://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/34339.skype-for-business-online-enable-your-tenant-for-modern-authentication.aspx) to set up modern authentication for Skype. |
| Office app policy not applied | App protection policies are not applying to any [supported Office App](https://www.microsoft.com/cloud-platform/microsoft-intune-partners) for any user. | Confirm that the user is licensed for Intune and the Office apps are targeted by a deployed app protection policy. It can take up to 8 hours for a newly deployed app protection policy to be applied. |
| Admin can't configure app protection policy in Azure portal | IT administrator user is unable to configure app protection policies in Azure portal. | The following user roles have access to the Azure portal: <ul><li>Global administrator, which you can set up in the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com/)</li><li>Owner, which you can set up in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).</li><li>Contributor, which you can set up in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).</li></ul> Refer to [Role-based administration control (RBAC) with Microsoft Intune](../fundamentals/role-based-access-control.md) for help setting up these roles.|
|User accounts missing from app protection policy reports | Admin console reports do not show user accounts to which app protection policy was recently deployed. | If a user is newly targeted by an app protection policy, it can take up to 24 hours for that user to show up in reports as a targeted user. |
| Policy changes not working | Changes and updates to app protection policy can take up to 8 hours to apply. | If applicable, the end-user can log out of the app and log back in to force sync with service. |
| App protection policy not working with DEP | App protection policy is not applying to Apple DEP devices. | Please ensure you are using User Affinity with Apple Device Enrollment Program (DEP). User Affinity is required for any app that requires user authentication under DEP. <br><br>Refer to [Automatically enroll iOS/iPadOS devices with Apple's Device Enrollment Program](../enrollment/device-enrollment-program-enroll-ios.md) for more information on iOS/iPadOS DEP enrollment.|
| Data transfer policy not working with iOS/iPadOS | The **Allow app to transfer data to other apps** and **Allow app to receive data from other apps** policies do not successfully manage data transfer in iOS/iPadOS. | See [How to manage data transfer between iOS/iPadOS apps in Microsoft Intune](data-transfer-between-apps-manage-ios.md). |

## Common end-user issues

Common end-user issues are broken down in the following categories:

* **Normal usage scenarios**: An end-user might experience these scenarios on apps that have an Intune app protection policy. These are not actual issues, but may be perceived as bugs or errors.

* **Normal usage dialogs**: These are usage dialogs an end-user might see in apps that have an Intune app protection policy. These messages and dialogs do **not** indicate an error or bug.

* **Error messages and dialogs**: These are error messages and dialogs an end-user might see on apps that have an Intune app protection policy. These often indicate an error was made by the IT administrator or a bug with Intune app protection.

### Normal usage scenarios

Platform | Scenario | Explanation |
---| --- | --- |
iOS | The end-user can use the iOS/iPadOS share extension to open work or school data in unmanaged apps, even with the data transfer policy set to **Managed apps only** or **No apps.** Doesn't this leak data? | Intune app protection policy cannot control the iOS/iPadOS share extension without managing the device. Therefore, **Intune encrypts "corporate" data before sharing it outside the app**. You can validate this by attempting to open the "corporate" file outside of the managed app. The file should be encrypted and unable to be opened outside the managed app.
iOS | Why is the end-user **prompted to install the Microsoft Authenticator app** | This is needed when App Based Conditional Access is applied, see [Require approved client app](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/app-based-conditional-access).
Android | Why does the end-user **need to install the Company Portal app**, even if I'm using MAM app protection without device enrollment?  | On Android, much of app protection functionality is built into the Company Portal app. **Device enrollment is not required even though the Company Portal app is always required**. For app protection without enrollment, the end-user just needs to have the Company Portal app installed on the device.
iOS/Android | App Protection policy not applied on draft email in the Outlook app | Since Outlook supports both corporate and personal context, it does not enforce MAM on draft email.
iOS/Android | App Protection policy not applied on new documents in WXP (Word,Excel,PowerPoint) | Since WXP supports both corporate and personal context, it does not enforce MAM on new documents until they are saved in an identified corporate location like OneDrive.
iOS/Android | Apps not allowing Save As to Local Storage when policy is enabled | The App behavior for this setting is controlled by the App Developer.
Android | Android has more restrictions than iOS/iPadOS on what "native" apps can access MAM protected content | Android is an open platform and the "native" app association can be changed by the end-user to potentially unsafe apps. Apply [Data transfer policy exceptions](app-protection-policies-exception.md) to exempt specific apps.
Android | Azure Information Protection (AIP) can Save as PDF when Save As is prevented | AIP honors the MAM policy for 'Disable printing' when Save as PDF is used.
iOS | Opening PDF attachments in Outlook app fails with "Action Not Allowed | This can occur if the user has not authenticated to Acrobat Reader for Intune, or has used thumbprint to authenticate to their organization. Open Acrobat Reader beforehand and authenticate using UPN credentials.


### Normal usage dialogs

Platform | Message or dialog | Explanation |
--- | --- | --- |
iOS, Android | **Sign-in**: To protect its data, your organization needs to manage this app. To complete this action, sign in with your work or school account. | The end-user must sign in with their work or school account in order to use this app, which requires an app protection policy. In order for the policy to apply, the user must authenticate against Azure Active Directory.
iOS, Android |**Restart Required**: Your organization is now protecting its data in this app. You need to restart the app to continue. | The app has just received an Intune app protection policy and must restart in order for the policy to apply.
iOS, Android |**Action Not Allowed**: Your organization only allows you to open work or school data in this app. | The IT administrator has set the **Allow app to receive data from other apps** to **Managed apps only**. Therefore, the end-user can only transfer data into this app from other apps that have an app protection policy.
iOS, Android |**Action Not Allowed**: Your organization only allows you to transfer its data to other managed apps. | The IT administrator has set the **Allow app to transfer data to other apps** to **Managed apps only**. Therefore, the end-user can only transfer data out of this app to other apps that have an app protection policy.
iOS, Android |**Wipe Alert**: Your organization has removed its data associated with this app. To continue, restart the app. | The IT administrator has initiated an app wipe using Intune app protection.
Android | **Company Portal required**: To use your work or school account with this app, you must install the Intune Company Portal app. Click "Go to store" to continue. | On Android, much of app protection functionality is built into the Company Portal app. **Device enrollment is not required even though the Company Portal app is always required**. For app protection without enrollment, the end-user just needs to have the Company Portal app installed on the device.
