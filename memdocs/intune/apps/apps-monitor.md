# Monitor app information and assignments with Microsoft Intune

[!INCLUDE [azure_portal](../includes/azure_portal.md)]

Intune provides several ways to monitor the properties of apps that you manage and to manage app assignment status.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431).
2. Select **Apps** > **All apps**.
3. In the list of apps, select an app to monitor. You'll then see the app pane, which includes an overview of the device status and the user status.

> [!NOTE]
> Microsoft Store and Android Store apps that are deployed as **Available** do not report their installation status.
>
> For Managed Google Play apps deployed to Android Enterprise personally-owned work profile devices, you can view the status and version number of the app installed on a device using Intune.
>
> From the **Installed apps** page of the Windows Company Portal or the Company Portal website, end users can view the installation status and details for device-assigned required apps. This functionality is provided in addition to the installation status and details of user-assigned required apps.

## App overview pane

In the app pane, you can review details about the status of an app in your environment.

### Essentials
The **Essentials** section provides the following information about the app if applicable:

 | **App details**            | **Description**                                                      |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Publisher**          | The publisher of the app                                            |

| **Version**            | If applicable, the version number of the app |
| **MAM SDK enabled**    | If applicable, whether the app uses the Intune MAM SDK (**Yes** or **No**)                  |
| **Created**             | The date and time when this revision was created <b>**Note**: This date value is updated when an IT admin changes app metadata, such as changing the app category or app description.                        |
| **Assigned**           | Whether the app has been assigned (**Yes** or **No**)          
| **App package file**   | If applicable, the app package file name            |


### Device and user status graphs
The graphs show the number of apps for the following status:

| **Device status**       | **Description**                                       |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| **Installed**         | The number of apps installed                         |

| **Failed**            | The number of failed installations                   |
| **Install Pending**   | The number of apps that are in the process of being installed |

> [!NOTE]
> Even if the App is targetted to device context and into a device group, the user name will always be reported. You may refer to the corresponded [API Call](/graph/api/intune-apps-mobileappinstallstatus-get). Additionally, the system context may appear as "No user".
