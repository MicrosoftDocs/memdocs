# Get ready for Windows Information Protection in Windows 10/11 

[!INCLUDE [azure_portal](../includes/azure_portal.md)]

Enable Windows Information Protection (WIP) for Windows 10/11 by setting the WIP provider in Microsoft Entra ID. Setting a WIP provider in Microsoft Entra ID allows you to define the enrollment state when creating a new WIP policy with Intune. The enrollment state can be either WIP or mobile device management (MDM).

>[!IMPORTANT]
> Windows Information Protection (WIP) policies without enrollment has been deprecated. You can no longer create WIP policies for unenrolled devices.
