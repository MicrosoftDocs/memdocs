# Add app configuration policies for managed apps without device enrollment

[!INCLUDE [azure_portal](../includes/azure_portal.md)]

You can use app configuration policies with managed apps that support the Intune App SDK, even on devices that are not enrolled. 

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431).
2. Choose the **Apps** > **App configuration policies** > **Add** > **Managed apps**.
3. On the **Basics** page, set the following details:
    - **Name**: The name of the profile that will appear in the Azure portal.
    - **Description**: The  description of the profile that will appear in the Azure portal.
    - **Device enrollment type**: Managed apps is selected.
4. Choose either **Select public apps** or **Select custom apps** to choose the app that you are going to configure. Select the app from the list of apps that you have approved and synchronized with Intune.
5. Click **Next** to display the **Settings** page.
6. The **Settings page** provides options that are displayed based on the app that you're configuring:

    - **General configuration settings** - For each general configuration setting that the app supports, type the **Name** and **Value**. 
 
        Intune App SDK-enabled apps support configurations in key/value pairs. To learn more about which key-value configurations are supported, consult the documentation for each app. Note that you can use tokens that will be dynamically populated with data generated by the application. To delete a general configuration setting, choose the ellipsis (**…**) and select **Delete**. For more information, see [Configuration values for using tokens](app-configuration-policies-managed-app.md#configuration-values-for-using-tokens). 

    - **Outlook configuration settings** - Outlook for iOS and Android offers administrators the ability to customize the default configuration for several in-app settings. For more information, see [Outlook for iOS and Android - General app configuration scenarios](https://docs.microsoft.com/exchange/clients-and-mobile-in-exchange-online/outlook-for-ios-and-android/outlook-for-ios-and-android-configuration-with-microsoft-intune#general-app-configuration-scenarios).
   
    - **S/MIME** - Secure Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (S/MIME) is a specification that allows users to send and receive digitally signed and encrypted emails.
        - **Enable S/MIME** - Specify whether or not S/MIME controls are enabled when composing an email. Default value: **Not configured**.
        - **Allow user to change setting** - Specify if the user is allowed to change the setting. S/MIME must be enabled. Default value: **Yes**.
        
    For information about Outlook app configuration policy settings, see [Deploying Outlook for iOS and Android app configuration settings](https://docs.microsoft.com/exchange/clients-and-mobile-in-exchange-online/outlook-for-ios-and-android/outlook-for-ios-and-android-configuration-with-microsoft-intune).

7. Click **Next** to display the **Assignments** page.
8. Click **Select groups to include**.
9. Select a group in the **Select groups to include** pane and click **Select**.
10. Click **Select groups to exclude** to display the related pane.
11. Choose the groups you want to exclude and then click **Select**.

    >[!NOTE]
    >When adding a group, if any other group has already been included for a given assignment type, it is pre-selected and unchangeable for other include assignment types. Therefore, that group that has been used, cannot be used as an excluded group.

12. Click **Next** to display the **Review + create** page.
13. Click **Create** to add the app configuration policy to Intune.

## Configuration values for using tokens

Intune can generate certain tokens and send them to the managed application. For example, if your app configuration can use an email setting, you can add a dynamic email by using a token. Type the name expected by the app in the **Name** field, and then type `{{mail}}` in the **Value** field.

Intune supports the following token types in the configuration settings. Other custom key/value pairs are not supported.

- \{\{userprincipalname\}\}—for example, John@contoso.com
- \{\{mail\}\}—for example, John@contoso.com
- \{\{partialupn\}\}—for example, John
- \{\{accountid\}\}—for example, fc0dc142-71d8-4b12-bbea-bae2a8514c81
- \{\{userid\}\}—for example, 3ec2c00f-b125-4519-acf0-302ac3761822
- \{\{username\}\}—for example, John Doe
- \{\{PrimarySMTPAddress\}\}—for example, testuser@ad.domain.com

> [!Note]  
> The \{\{ and \}\} characters are used by token types only and must not be used for other purposes.

## Next steps

Continue to [assign](apps-deploy.md) and [monitor](apps-monitor.md) the app as usual.
