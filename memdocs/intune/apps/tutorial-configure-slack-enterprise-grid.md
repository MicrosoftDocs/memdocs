# Tutorial: Configure Slack to use Intune for EMM and app configuration

Slack is a collaboration app that you can use with Microsoft Intune.   

In this tutorial, you will:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> - Set Intune as the Enterprise Mobility Management (EMM) provider on your Slack Enterprise Grid. You'll be able to limit access to your Grid plan's workspaces to Intune managed devices.
> - Create app configuration policies to manage the Slack for EMM app on iOS/iPadOS and the Slack app for Android personally-owned work profile devices.
> - Create Intune device compliance policies to set the conditions Android and iOS/iPadOS devices must meet to be considered compliant.

If you don't have an Intune subscription, [sign up for a free trial account](../fundamentals/free-trial-sign-up.md).

## Prerequisites

You'll need a test tenant with the following subscriptions for this tutorial:

- Microsoft Entra ID P1 or P2 ([free trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F))
- Intune subscription ([free trial](../fundamentals/free-trial-sign-up.md))

You will also need a [Slack Enterprise Grid](https://get.slack.help/hc/articles/360004150931-What-is-Slack-Enterprise-Grid-) plan.

## Configure your Slack Enterprise Grid plan

Turn on EMM for your Slack Enterprise Grid plan by following [Slack's instructions](https://get.slack.help/hc/articles/115002579426-Enable-Enterprise-Mobility-Management-for-your-org#step-2:-turn-on-emm) and [connect Microsoft Entra ID](/azure/active-directory/saas-apps/slack-tutorial) as your Grid plan's identity provider (IDP).

## Sign in to Intune

Sign in to the [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431) as an [Intune administrator](../fundamentals/users-add.md#types-of-administrators). If you have created an Intune Trial subscription, the account you created the subscription with is the Global administrator.

## Set up Slack for EMM on iOS devices

Add the iOS/iPadOS app Slack for EMM to your Intune tenant and create an app configuration policy to enable your organizations' iOS/iPadOS users to access Slack with Intune as an EMM provider.

### Add the iOS/iPadOS Slack for EMM app to Intune

Add Slack for EMM as a managed iOS/iPadOS app in Intune and assign your Slack users. Apps are platform-specific, so you need to add a separate Intune app for your Slack users on Android devices.

1. In [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431), select **Apps** > **All apps** > **Add**.

2. Under **App type**, choose **iOS store app** and click **Select**.

3. Click **Search the App Store**. Enter the search term "Slack for EMM" and select the app. Click **Select** in the **Search the App Store** pane.

4. In the **App information** step, configure any changes as you see fit. Select **Next** to set your app information.

5. In the **Assignments** step, click **Add group** under the **Required** section. Select one or more groups to assign the app to. When complete, click **Next** to continue. 

6. In the **Review + create** step, click **Create** once you have verified the app details. 

### Add an iOS/iPadOS app configuration policy for the Slack for EMM app

Add an app configuration policy for the iOS/iPadOS Slack for EMM app.

> [!NOTE]
> App configuration policies for managed devices are platform-specific, so you need to add a separate policy for your Slack users on Android devices.

1. In [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431), select **Apps** > **App configuration policies** > **Add** > **Managed devices**.

2. For **Name**, enter "Slack app configuration policy test".

3. For **Device enrollment type**, confirm **Managed devices** is set.

4. For **Platform**, select **iOS/iPadOS**.

   > [!NOTE]
   > The `OrgDomain` configuration key provides the ability to enter your organization’s URL domain to help users sign in. 

9. Click **Next**.

10. In the **Assignments** step, click **All Users**. Then, click **Next**.

11. In the **Review + create** step, click **Create** to create the configuration policy.

### (Optional) Create an iOS device compliance policy

Set up an Intune device compliance policy to set the conditions that a device must meet to be considered compliant. For this tutorial, we'll create a device compliance policy for iOS/iPadOS devices. Compliance policies are platform-specific, so you need to create a separate policy for your Slack users on Android devices.

1. In [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431), select **Devices** > **Compliance**, and then select **Create Policy**.

8. In the **Review + create** step, click **Create** to create the compliance policy.

## Launch Slack

With the policies you've just created, any iOS/iPadOS or Android personally-owned work profile devices that attempt to sign in to one of your workspaces will need to be Intune enrolled. To test this scenario, try launching Slack for EMM on an Intune enrolled iOS/iPadOS device or launching Slack on an Intune enrolled Android personally-owned work profile device. 

## Next steps

In this tutorial:

- You set Intune as the Enterprise Mobility Management (EMM) provider on your Slack Enterprise Grid. 
- You created app configuration policies to manage the Slack for EMM app on iOS/iPadOS and the Slack app for Android personally-owned work profile devices.
- You created Intune device compliance policies to set the conditions Android and iOS/iPadOS devices must meet to be considered compliant.

To learn more about app configuration policies, see [App configuration policies for Microsoft Intune](app-configuration-policies-overview.md). To learn more about device compliance policies, see [Set rules on devices to allow access to resources in your organization using Intune](../protect/device-compliance-get-started.md).
