# Manage collaboration experiences using Office for iOS and Android with Microsoft Intune

Office for iOS and Android delivers several key benefits including:

- Combining Word, Excel, and PowerPoint in a way that simplifies the experience with fewer apps to download or switch between. It requires far less phone storage than installing individual apps while maintaining virtually all the capabilities of the existing mobile apps people already know and use.
- Integrating Office Lens technology to unlock the power of the camera with capabilities like converting images into editable Word and Excel documents, scanning PDFs, and capturing whiteboards with automatic digital enhancements to make the content easier to read.
- Adding new functionality for common tasks people often encounter when working on a phoneâ€”things like making quick notes, signing PDFs, scanning QR codes, and transferring files between devices.

The richest and broadest protection capabilities for Microsoft 365 data are available when you subscribe to the Enterprise Mobility + Security suite, which includes Microsoft Intune and Azure Active Directory Premium features, such as conditional access. At a minimum, you will want to deploy a conditional access policy that allows connectivity to Office for iOS and Android from mobile devices and an Intune app protection policy that ensures the collaboration experience is protected.

## Apply Conditional Access
Organizations can use use Azure AD Conditional Access policies to ensure that users can only access work or school content using Office for iOS and Android. To do this, you will need a conditional access policy that targets all potential users. Details on creating this policy can be found in [Require app protection policy for cloud app access with Conditional Access](/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/app-protection-based-conditional-access).

1. Follow "Step 1: Configure an Azure AD Conditional Access policy for Office 365" in [Scenario 1: Office 365 apps require approved apps with app protection policies](/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/app-protection-based-conditional-access#scenario-1-office-365-apps-require-approved-apps-with-app-protection-policies), which allows Office for iOS and Android, but blocks third-party OAuth capable mobile device clients from connecting to Office 365 endpoints.

   >[!NOTE]
   > This policy ensures mobile users can access all Office endpoints using the applicable apps.

## Create Intune app protection policies

App Protection Policies (APP) define which apps are allowed and the actions they can take with your organization's data. The choices available in APP enable organizations to tailor the protection to their specific needs. For some, it may not be obvious which policy settings are required to implement a complete scenario. To help organizations prioritize mobile client endpoint hardening, Microsoft has introduced taxonomy for its APP data protection framework for iOS and Android mobile app management.

The APP data protection framework is organized into three distinct configuration levels, with each level building off the previous level:

- **Enterprise basic data protection** (Level 1) ensures that apps are protected with a PIN and encrypted and performs selective wipe operations. For Android devices, this level validates Android device attestation. This is an entry level configuration that provides similar data protection control in Exchange Online mailbox policies and introduces IT and the user population to APP.
- **Enterprise enhanced data protection** (Level 2) introduces APP data leakage prevention mechanisms and minimum OS requirements. This is the configuration that is applicable to most mobile users accessing work or school data.
- **Enterprise high data protection** (Level 3) introduces advanced data protection mechanisms, enhanced PIN configuration, and APP Mobile Threat Defense. This configuration is desirable for users that are accessing high risk data.

To see the specific recommendations for each configuration level and the minimum apps that must be protected, review [Data protection framework using app protection policies](app-protection-framework.md).

Regardless of whether the device is enrolled in an unified endpoint management (UEM) solution, an Intune app protection policy needs to be created for both iOS and Android apps, using the steps in [How to create and assign app protection policies](app-protection-policies.md). These policies, at a minimum, must meet the following conditions:

1. They include all Microsoft 365 mobile applications, such as Edge, Outlook, OneDrive, Office, or Teams, as this ensures that users can access and manipulate work or school data within any Microsoft app in a secure fashion.

2. They are assigned to all users. This ensures that all users are protected, regardless of whether they use Office for iOS or Android.

3. Determine which framework level meets your requirements. Most organizations should implement the settings defined in **Enterprise enhanced data protection** (Level 2) as that enables data protection and access requirements controls.

For more information on the available settings, see [Android app protection policy settings](app-protection-policy-settings-android.md) and [iOS app protection policy settings](app-protection-policy-settings-ios.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To apply Intune app protection policies against apps on Android devices that are not enrolled in Intune, the user must also install the Intune Company Portal. For more information, see [What to expect when your Android app is managed by app protection policies](../fundamentals/end-user-mam-apps-android.md).

## Utilize app configuration

Office for iOS and Android supports app settings that allow unified endpoint management, like Microsoft Endpoint Manager, administrators to customize the behavior of the app.

App configuration can be delivered either through the mobile device management (MDM) OS channel on enrolled devices ([Managed App Configuration](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/samplecode/sc2279/Introduction/Intro.html) channel for iOS or the [Android in the Enterprise](https://developer.android.com/work/managed-configurations) channel for Android) or through the Intune App Protection Policy (APP) channel. Office for iOS and Android supports the following configuration scenarios:

- Only allow work or school accounts
- General app configuration
- Data protection settings

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For configuration scenarios that require device enrollment on Android, the devices must be enrolled in Android Enterprise and Office for Android must be deployed via the Managed Google Play store. For more information, see [Set up enrollment of Android Enterprise personally-owned work profile devices](../enrollment/android-work-profile-enroll.md) and [Add app configuration policies for managed Android Enterprise devices](app-configuration-policies-use-android.md).

Each configuration scenario highlights its specific requirements. For example, whether the configuration scenario requires device enrollment, and thus works with any UEM provider, or requires Intune App Protection Policies.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> App configuration keys are case sensitive. Use the proper casing to ensure the configuration takes affect.

> [!NOTE]
> With Microsoft Endpoint Manager, app configuration delivered through the MDM OS channel is referred to as a **Managed Devices** App Configuration Policy (ACP); app configuration delivered through the App Protection Policy channel is referred to as a **Managed Apps** App Configuration Policy.

## Only allow work or school accounts

Respecting the data security and compliance policies of our largest and highly regulated customers is a key pillar to the Microsoft 365 value. Some companies have a requirement to capture all communications information within their corporate environment, as well as, ensure the devices are only used for corporate communications. To support these requirements, Office for Android on enrolled devices can be configured to only allow a single corporate account to be provisioned within the app.

You can learn more about configuring the org allowed accounts mode setting here:

- [Android setting](app-configuration-policies-use-android.md#allow-only-configured-organization-accounts-in-multi-identity-apps)

This configuration scenario only works with enrolled devices. However, any UEM provider is supported. If you are not using Microsoft Endpoint Manager, you need to consult with your UEM documentation on how to deploy these configuration keys.

> [!NOTE]
> At this time, only Office for Android supports org allowed accounts mode.

## General app configuration scenarios

Office for iOS and Android offers administrators the ability to customize the default configuration for several in-app settings.  This capability is offered for both enrolled devices via any UEM provider and for devices that are not enrolled when Office for iOS and Android has an Intune App Protection Policy applied.

> [!NOTE]
> If an App Protection Policy is targeted to the users, the recommendation is to deploy the general app configuration settings in a **Managed Apps** enrollment model. This ensures the App Configuration Policy is deployed to both enrolled devices and unenrolled devices. 

Office supports the following settings for configuration:

- Manage the creation of Sticky Notes

### Manage the creation of Sticky Notes

By default, Office for iOS and Android enables users to create Sticky Notes. For users with Exchange Online mailboxes, the notes are synchronized into the user's mailbox. For users with on-premises mailboxes, these notes are only stored on the local device.

|    Key    |    Value    |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|
|    com.microsoft.office.NotesCreationEnabled    |    **true** (default) enables Sticky Notes creation for the work or school account<br>**false** disables Sticky Notes creation for the work or school account    |


## Data protection app configuration scenarios

Office for iOS and Android supports app configuration policies for the following data protection settings when the app is managed by Microsoft Endpoint Manager with an Intune App Protection Policy applied to the work or school account that is signed into the app and the policy settings are delivered only through a managed apps App Configuration Policy:

- Manage file transfers via Transfer Files action
- Manage file transfers via Share Nearby action

These settings can be deployed to the app regardless of device enrollment status.

### Manage file transfers

By default, Office for iOS and Android enables users to share content using a variety of mechanisms:

- If the file is hosted in OneDrive or SharePoint, users can initiate a share request directly within the file.
- Users can transfer files to desktop systems using the **Transfer Files** action.
- Users can share files to nearby mobile devices using the **Share Nearby** action.

The **Transfer Files** and **Share Nearby** actions only work with media, local files, and files that are not protected by an App Protection Policy. 

|    Key    |    Value    |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|
|    com.microsoft.office.ShareNearby.IsAllowed.IntuneMAMOnly    |    **true** (default) enables the Share Nearby feature for the work or school account<br>**false** disables the Share Nearby feature for the work or school account    |
|    com.microsoft.office.TransferFiles.IsAllowed.IntuneMAMOnly    |    **true** (default) enables the Transfer Files feature for the work or school account<br>**false** disables the Transfer Files feature for the work or school account    |

### Deploy app configuration scenarios with Microsoft Endpoint Manager

If you are using Microsoft Endpoint Manager as your mobile app management provider, see [Add app configuration policies for managed apps without device enrollment](app-configuration-policies-managed-app.md) on how to create a  managed apps app configuration policy for the data protection app configuration scenarios. After the configuration is created, you can assign the policy to groups of users.
