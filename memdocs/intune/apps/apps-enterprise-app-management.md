# Microsoft Intune Enterprise Application Management

Microsoft Intune Enterprise App Management enables you to easily discover and deploy applications and keep them up to date from the Enterprise App Catalog. The Enterprise App Catalog is a collection of prepared Microsoft and non-Microsoft applications. These apps are Win32 apps that are [prepared as Win32 apps](../apps/apps-win32-prepare.md) and hosted by Microsoft.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Enterprise App Management is an Intune add-on as part of the Intune suite that is available for trial and purchase. For more information, see [Use Intune Suite add-on capabilities](../fundamentals/intune-add-ons.md).

## Benefits of Enterprise App Management

The Enterprise App Management provides the following benefits:

- **Streamlined app management**: You can save time and reduce complexity by streamlining the app management process. Discover and add apps directly from the Intune console.
- **Stay current with updates**: You're able to keep apps up-to-date by easily creating apps for the new versions of products as they're available in the catalog. Use the **Enterprise App Catalog apps with updates** report.

When you add an Enterprise App Catalog app, Intune prefills the following installation details:

- Commands to install and uninstall the app
- Time required to install the app
- Option to allow app uninstallation by the end user
- Installation and device restart behavior
- Return codes to indicate post-installation behavior
- Whether to install the app for system or user
  
Microsoft Intune prefills the detection rules that devices must meet before the app is installed:

- File size
- File version
- Registry

Also, Intune prefills the requirements that devices must meet before the app is installed:

- Windows OS architecture required
- Minimum OS required

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Microsoft recommends using the pre-populated fields containing specific commands and rules, however you can modify the pre-populated fields if needed.

You can also configure app specific rules used to detect the presence of the Enterprise App Catalog app. You can choose to either manually configure the detection rules or use a custom script to detect the presence of the app before installing the app.

## Self-updating apps

The Enterprise App Catalog includes apps that self update. Intune ensures the app is at least at a target minimum version, and considers the app installed if the detected version of the app is at or above the minimum version. Self-updating apps update on client devices based on the vendor's process. Intune reports the version of the app detected on the device.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Self-updating apps may require that your tenant has network rules configured to allow an update from the app vendor.

## Frequently asked questions (FAQ)

### How can I request to add an application to the Enterprise App Catalog?

We have added a new category to the [Microsoft Feedback Portal](https://feedbackportal.microsoft.com/feedback/forum/ef1d6d38-fd1b-ec11-b6e7-0022481f8472) that allows you to submit application requests, suggest changes, and share any other feedback about Enterprise application management. We recommend you filter the feedback portal under **Categories** by selecting **Enterprise App Management (Intune add-on)** to successfully route your requests and feedback.

To request adding an application to the Enterprise app catalog use the [Microsoft Feedback Portal](https://feedbackportal.microsoft.com/feedback/forum/ef1d6d38-fd1b-ec11-b6e7-0022481f8472). The feedback portal will also give Microsoft the ability to communicate with you on the status of your request and other communication about your request.

Include the following details when requesting to add an application:
- Application publisher
- Application name
- Download URL

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Enterprise application management does not support the addition of applications that are behind a paywall or login screen.

You can also upvote an application previously submitted by someone else. Applications with large numbers of votes receive the most consideration and effort to be added to the catalog. However, priority depends on complexity of the applications mechanics.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Microsoft makes no guarantee, express or implied, with respect to adding a requested app to the Enterprise App Catalog. Once the submission is reviewed using the form provided above, the app may or may not be added to the Enterprise App Catalog. Microsoft does not offer or assume any Service Level Agreement (SLA) or timeline with regard to adding an app to the Enterprise App Catalog.

### Where are the devices downloading the app content from?

Microsoft hosts the applications in Microsoft storage accessible through `*.manage.microsoft.com`. For the full list of network requirements, see [Network endpoints for Microsoft Intune](../fundamentals/intune-endpoints.md?tabs=north-america).  

### Is Microsoft providing security around any of the content provided in the Enterprise App Catalog?

No. Microsoft makes no guarantee, express or implied, with respect to the security and compliance of the applications provided in the Enterprise App Catalog.

### What app installer types are in the Enterprise App Catalog?

The apps currently provided in the Enterprise application catalog are Windows Win32 applications (exe and msi).

### How will Microsoft detect if an application from the Enterprise App Catalog is in use?

At this time, Intune provides no running application detection.

### What is the Service Level Agreement (SLA) for when an app update is available in the catalog?

No SLA is currently available.

### How can working with the applications in Enterprise App Catalog be automated?

Graph API is planned to be available soon.

### Will Enterprise catalog apps automatically update to a new version when a new version is available in the Enterprise app catalog?

Updates are shown in Monitor report under Enterprise App Catalog apps with updates. The updates won't be applied automatically. You still need to go in and create a new app with supersedence relationship.

### Can you get licensed applications from this catalog?

Yes. You can get licensed applications from the Enterprise App Catalog, although you're responsible for purchasing the license from the vendor and distributing it to your organization. Intune doesn't perform a license check on Enterprise App Catalog apps.

### Can Enterprise App Management be purchased standalone?

Yes. Enterprise App Management can be purchased as a standalone SKU or as part of the Microsoft Intune Suite.

### Can Enterprise App Management be leveraged with Microsoft Configuration Manager?

Enterprise App Management is only provided by Microsoft Intune. Configuration Manager doesn't directly support Enterprise App Management apps, however co-managed clients can get Enterprise App Catalog apps when targeted from Microsoft Intune.

### Does Enterprise App Management use **Winget**?

No. Enterprise App Catalog apps are directly installed by the Intune management extension (IME).

### How do I update my Enterprise App Catalog app?

For applications that donâ€™t update themselves, you can view the upgrades that are available for the EAM app via supersedence.

### After several hours, what can I do if my app continues to show that it isn't ready and that the requested content is still being prepared?

If the app content hasn't synced after several hours, delete the app and try again.

### Is there an Intune report available to view details about the Enterprise App Catalog apps for a specific device?

Yes, the Managed Apps report provides a report of apps on a specific device that are currently installed, not installed, or available for install. For the device, the report provides details about the application, version, resolved intent, and installation status. For more information about this report, see [Managed Apps report](../fundamentals/reports.md#managed-apps-report-operational).


## Apps available in the Enterprise App Catalog
