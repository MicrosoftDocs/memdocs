# iOS app protection policy settings
[!INCLUDE [azure_portal](../includes/azure_portal.md)]

This article describes the app protection policy settings for iOS/iPadOS devices. The policy settings that are described can be [configured](app-protection-policies.md) for an app protection policy on the **Settings** pane in the portal when you make a new policy.

There are three categories of policy settings: *Data relocation*, *Access requirements*, and *Conditional launch*. In this article, the term ***policy-managed apps*** refers to apps that are configured with app protection policies.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Intune Managed Browser has been retired. Use [Microsoft Edge](../apps/manage-microsoft-edge.md) for your protected Intune browser experience. 

## Data protection

### Data Transfer
| Setting | How to use | Default value |
|------|----------|-------|
| **Backup Org data to iTunes and iCloud backups** | Select **Block** to prevent this app from backing up work or school data to iTunes and iCloud. Select **Allow** to allow this app to back up of work or school data to iTunes and iCloud. | **Allow**  |
| **Send Org data to other apps** | Specify what apps can receive data from this app: <ul><li>**All apps**: Allow transfer to any app. The receiving app will have the ability to read and edit the data.</li><li>**None**: Do not allow data transfer to any app, including other policy-managed apps. If the user performs a managed open-in function and transfers a document, the data will be encrypted and unreadable.</li><li> **Policy managed apps**: Allow transfer only to other policy-managed apps. <p><p>**Note:** _Users may be able to transfer content via Open-in or Share extensions to unmanaged apps on unenrolled devices or enrolled devices that allow sharing to unmanaged apps. Transferred data is encrypted by Intune and unreadable by unmanaged apps._</li><li> **Policy managed apps with OS sharing**: Only allow data transfer to other policy managed apps, as well as file transfers to other MDM managed apps on enrolled devices. <p><p>**Note:** _The **Policy managed apps with OS sharing** value is applicable to MDM enrolled devices only. If this setting is targeted to a user on an unenrolled device, the behavior of the **Policy managed apps** value applies. Users will be able to transfer unencrypted content via Open-in or Share extensions to any application allowed by the iOS MDM allowOpenFromManagedtoUnmanaged setting, assuming the sending app has the IntuneMAMUPN configured; for more information, see [How to manage data transfer between iOS apps in Microsoft Intune](data-transfer-between-apps-manage-ios.md). See https://developer.apple.com/business/documentation/Configuration-Profile-Reference.pdf for more information on this iOS/iPadOS MDM setting._<p><p></li><li>**Policy managed apps with Open-In/Share filtering**: Allow transfer only to other policy managed apps, and filter OS Open-in/Share dialogs to only display policy managed apps. To configure the filtering of the **Open-In/Share** dialog, it requires both the app(s) acting as the file/document source and the app(s) that can open this file/document to have the Intune SDK for iOS version 8.1.1 or above. <p><p>**Note:** _Users may be able to transfer content via Open-in or Share extensions to unmanaged apps if Intune private data type are supported by the app. Transferred data is encrypted by Intune and unreadable by unmanaged apps._</li></ul><br>In addition, when set to **Policy managed apps** or **None**, the Spotlight search (enables searching data within apps) and Siri shortcuts iOS features are blocked. <p><p>This policy can also apply to iOS/iPadOS Universal Links. General web links are managed by the **Open app links in Intune Managed Browser** policy setting. <p> There are some exempt apps and services to which Intune may allow data transfer by default. In addition, you can create your own exemptions if you need to allow data to transfer to an app that doesn't support Intune APP. See [data transfer exemptions](#data-transfer-exemptions) for more information. | **All apps** |
| <ul>**Select apps to exempt** | This option is available when you select *Policy managed apps* for the previous option.   |   |
| <ul>**Select universal links to exempt** | Specify which iOS/iPadOS [Universal Links](#universal-links) should open in the specified *unmanaged* application instead of the protected browser specified by the **Restrict web content transfer with other apps** setting. You must contact the application developer to determine the correct universal link format for each application.   |   |
| <ul>**Select managed universal links** | Specify which iOS/iPadOS [Universal Links](#universal-links) should open in the specified *managed* application instead of the protected browser specified by the **Restrict web content transfer with other apps** setting. You must contact the application developer to determine the correct universal link format for each application.   |   |
|<ul>**Save copies of org data** | Choose **Block** to disable the use of the Save As option in this app. Choose **Allow** if you want to allow the use of *Save As*. When set to *Block*, you can configure the setting *Allow user to save copies to selected services*. <br><br>**Note:**<ul><li><i>This setting is supported for Microsoft Excel, OneNote, Outlook, PowerPoint, and Word. It can also be supported by third-party and LOB apps.</i></li><li><i>This setting is only configurable when the setting **Send org data to other apps** is set to **Policy managed apps**, **Policy managed apps with OS sharing** or **Policy managed apps with Open-In/Share filtering**.</i></li><li><i>This setting will be "Allow" when the setting **Send org data to other apps** is set to **All apps**. </i></li><li><i>This setting will be "Block" with no allowed service locations when the setting **Send org data to other apps** is set to **None**. </i></li></ul> | **Allow** |  
| <ul><ul>**Allow user to save copies to selected services** | Users can save to the selected services (OneDrive for Business, SharePoint, and Local Storage). All other services are blocked. OneDrive for Business: you can save files to OneDrive for Business and SharePoint Online. SharePoint: you can save files to on-premises SharePoint. Local Storage: you can save files to local storage.| **0 selected**  |
|<ul>**Transfer telecommunication data to** | Typically, when a user selects a hyperlinked phone number in an app, a dialer app will open with the phone number prepopulated and ready to call. For this setting, choose how to handle this type of content transfer when it is initiated from a policy-managed app:<ul><li>**None, do not transfer this data between apps**: Do not transfer communication data when a phone number is detected.</li><li>**A specific dialer app**: Allow a specific dialer app to initiate contact when a phone number is detected.</li><li>**Any dialer app**: Allow any dialer app to be used to initiate contact when a phone number is detected.</li></ul> <p>**Note**: *This setting requires Intune SDK 12.7.0 and later. If your apps rely on dialer functionality and are not using the correct Intune SDK version, as a workaround, consider adding "tel;telprompt" as a data transfer exemption. Once the apps support the correct Intune SDK version, the exemption can be removed.*| **Any dialer app** |  
|<ul><ul>**Dialer App URL Scheme** | When a specific dialer app has been selected, you must provide the dialer app URL scheme that is used to launch the dialer app on iOS devices. For more information, see Apple's documentation about [Phone Links](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/featuredarticles/iPhoneURLScheme_Reference/PhoneLinks/PhoneLinks.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40007899-CH6-SW1). | **Blank** |
| **Receive data from other apps** | Specify what apps can transfer data to this app: <ul><li>**All apps**: Allow data transfer from any app.</li><li>**None**: Do not allow data transfer from any app, including other policy-managed apps.</li><li>**Policy managed apps**: Allow transfer only from other policy-managed apps.</li><li>**All apps with incoming Org data**: Allow data transfer from any app. Treat all incoming data without a user identity as data from your organization. The data will be marked with the MDM enrolled user's identity as defined by the `IntuneMAMUPN` setting.<p><p>**Note:** _The **All apps with incoming Org data** value is applicable to MDM enrolled devices only. If this setting is targeted to a user on an unenrolled device, the behavior of the **Any apps** value applies._</li></ul> Multi-identity MAM enabled applications will attempt to switch to an unmanaged account when receiving unmanaged data if this setting is configured to **None** or **Policy managed apps**. If there is no unmanaged account signed into the app or the app is unable to switch, the incoming data will be blocked.<br><br> | **All apps** |
| <ul>**Open data into Org documents** | Select **Block** to disable the use of the *Open* option or other options to share data between accounts in this app. Select **Allow** if you want to allow the use of *Open*. <br><br>When set to **Block** you can configure the **Allow user to open data from selected services** to specific which services are allowed for Org data locations.<br><br>**Note:**<ul><li><i>This setting is only configurable when the setting **Receive data from other apps** is set to **Policy managed apps**.</i></li><li><i>This setting will be "Allow" when the setting **Receive data from other apps** is set to **All apps** or **All apps with incoming Org data**. </i></li><li><i>This setting will be "Block" with no allowed service locations when the setting **Receive data from other apps** is set to **None**.</i></li><li><i>The following apps support this setting:</i><ul><li><i>OneDrive 11.45.3 or later.</i></li><li><i>Outlook for iOS 4.60.0 or later.</i></li><li><i>Teams for iOS 3.17.0 or later.</i></li></ul></li></ul> | **Allow** |
| <ul><ul>**Allow users to open data from selected services** | Select the application storage services that users can open data from. All other services are blocked. Selecting no services will prevent users from opening data from external locations.<br><br>Supported services:<ul><li>OneDrive for Business</li><li>SharePoint Online</li><li>Camera</li></ul> **Note:** Camera does not include Photos or Photo Gallery access. | **All selected**  |
| **Restrict cut, copy and paste between other apps** | Specify when cut, copy, and paste actions can be used with this app. Select from: <ul><li>**Blocked**:  Don't allow cut, copy, and paste actions between this app and any other app.</li><li>**Policy managed apps**: Allow cut, copy, and paste actions between this app and other policy-managed apps.</li><li>**Policy managed with paste in**: Allow cut or copy between this app and other policy-managed apps. Allow data from any app to be pasted into this app.</li><li>**Any app**: No restrictions for cut, copy, and paste to and from this app.</ul> | **Any app** |
| <ul>**Cut and copy character limit for any app** | Specify the number of characters that may be cut or copied from Org data and accounts.  This will allow sharing of the specified number of characters to any application, regardless of the **Restrict cut, copy, and paste with other apps** setting.<p>Default Value = 0<p>**Note**: *Requires app to have Intune SDK version 9.0.14 or later.*  | **0** |
| **Third party keyboards** | Choose **Block** to prevent the use of third-party keyboards in managed applications.<p>When this setting is enabled, the user receives a one-time message stating that the use of third-party keyboards is blocked. This message appears the first time a user interacts with organizational data that requires the use of a keyboard. Only the standard iOS/iPadOS keyboard is available while using managed applications, and all other keyboard options are disabled. This setting will affect both the organization and personal accounts of multi-identity applications. This setting does not affect the use of third-party keyboards in unmanaged applications.<p>**Note:** This feature requires the app to use Intune SDK version 12.0.16 or later. Apps with SDK versions from 8.0.14 to, and including, 12.0.15, will not have this feature correctly apply for multi-identity apps. For more details, see [Known issue: Third party keyboards are not blocked in iOS/iPadOS for personal accounts](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Intune-Customer-Success/Updated-Known-issue-Third-party-keyboards-are-not-blocked-in-iOS/ba-p/339486). | **Allow** |

### Encryption
| Setting | How to use | Default value |
|------|----------|-------|
| **Encrypt Org data** | Choose Require to enable encryption of work or school data in this app.  Intune enforces iOS/iPadOS device-level encryption to protect app data  while the device is locked. In addition, applications may optionally encrypt app data using Intune APP SDK encryption. Intune APP SDK uses iOS/iPadOS cryptography methods to apply 256-bit AES encryption to app data. <br><br> When you enable this setting, the user may be required to set up and use a device PIN to access their device. If there's no device PIN and encryption is required, the user is prompted to set a PIN with the message "Your organization has required you to first enable a device PIN to access this app." <br><br> Go to the [official Apple documentation](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202739) to see which iOS/iPadOS encryption modules are FIPS 140-2 validated. | **Require**  |


### Functionality
| Setting | How to use | Default value |
|------|----------|-------|
|  **Sync policy managed app data with native apps** | Choose **Block** to prevent the policy managed apps from saving data to the native Contacts app on the device. If you choose **Allow**, the app can save data to the native Contacts app on the device, when those features are enabled within the policy managed app. <br><br>When you perform a selective wipe to remove work, or school data from the app, contacts data synced directly from the app to the native Contacts app are removed. Any contacts data synced from the native Contacts app to another external source can't be wiped. Currently, this applies only to Outlook for iOS app; for more information, see [Deploying Outlook for iOS and Android app configuration settings](/exchange/clients-and-mobile-in-exchange-online/outlook-for-ios-and-android/outlook-for-ios-and-android-configuration-with-microsoft-intune).   | **Allow**  |
| **Printing Org data** | Select **Block** to prevent the app from printing work or school data. If you leave this setting to **Allow**, the default value, users will be able to export and print all Org data.  | **Allow**  |
| **Restrict web content transfer with other apps** | Specify how web content (http/https links) are opened from policy-managed applications. Choose from: <ul><li>**Any app**: Allow web links in any app.</li><li>**Intune Managed Browser**: Allow web content to open only in the Intune Managed Browser. This browser is a policy-managed browser.</li><li>**Microsoft Edge**: Allow web content to open only in the Microsoft Edge. This browser is a policy-managed browser.</li><li>**Unmanaged browser**: Allow web content to open only in the unmanaged browser defined by **Unmanaged browser protocol** setting. The web content will be unmanaged in the target browser.<br>**Note**: Requires app to have Intune SDK version 11.0.9 or later.</li></ul> If you're using Intune to manage your devices, see [Manage Internet access using managed browser policies with Microsoft Intune](manage-microsoft-edge.md).<br><br>If a policy-managed browser is required but not installed, your end users will be prompted to install the Microsoft Edge.<p>If a policy-managed browser is required, iOS/iPadOS Universal Links are managed by the **Allow app to transfer data to other apps** policy setting. <p>**Intune device enrollment**<br>If you are using Intune to manage your devices, see Manage Internet access using managed browser policies with Microsoft Intune. <p>**Policy-managed Microsoft Edge**<br>The Microsoft Edge browser for mobile devices (iOS/iPadOS and Android) supports Intune app protection policies. Users who sign in with their corporate Azure AD accounts in the Microsoft Edge browser application will be protected by Intune. The Microsoft Edge browser integrates the Intune SDK and supports all of its data protection policies, with the exception of preventing:<br><ul><li>**Save-as**: The Microsoft Edge browser does not allow a user to add direct, in-app connections to cloud storage providers (such as OneDrive).</li><li>**Contact sync**: The Microsoft Edge browser does not save to native contact lists.</li></ul><br>**Note**: *The Intune SDK cannot determine if a target app is a browser. On iOS/iPadOS devices, no other managed browser apps are allowed.*    | **Not configured**  |
|<ul>**Unmanaged Browser Protocol** | Enter the protocol for a *single* unmanaged browser. Web content (http/https links) from policy managed applications will open in any app that supports this protocol. The web content will be unmanaged in the target browser. <br><br>This feature should only be used if you want to share protected content with a specific browser that is not enabled using Intune app protection policies. You must contact your browser vendor to determine the protocol supported by your desired browser.<br><br>**Note**: *Include only the protocol prefix. If your browser requires links of the form `mybrowser://www.microsoft.com`, enter `mybrowser`.*<br>Links will be translated as:<br><ul><li>`http://www.microsoft.com` > `mybrowser://www.microsoft.com`</li><li>`https://www.microsoft.com` > `mybrowsers://www.microsoft.com`</li></ul> | **Blank**  |
| **Org data notifications** | Specify how Org data is shared via OS notifications for Org accounts. This policy setting will impact the local device and any connected devices such as wearables and smart speakers. Apps may provide additional controls to customize notification behavior or may choose to not honor all values. Select from: <ul><li>**Blocked**: Do not share notifications.</li><ul><li>If not supported by the application, notifications will be allowed.</li></ul><li>**Block org Data**: Do not share Org data in notifications, for example.</li><UL><li>"You have new mail"; "You have a meeting".</li><li>If not supported by the application, notifications will be blocked.</li></ul><li>**Allow**: Shares Org data in the notifications.</li></ul> <p>**Note**: *This setting requires app support: <ul><li>Outlook for iOS 4.34.0 or later</li><li>Teams for iOS 2.0.22 or later.*</ul> | **Allow**   |
> [!NOTE]  
> None of the data protection settings control the Apple managed open-in feature on iOS/iPadOS devices. To use manage Apple open-in, see [Manage data transfer between iOS/iPadOS apps with Microsoft Intune](data-transfer-between-apps-manage-ios.md).

## Data transfer exemptions

There are some exempt apps and platform services that Intune app protection policy may allow data transfer to and from in certain scenarios. This list is subject to change and reflects the services and apps considered useful for secure productivity.

Third party unmanaged apps can be added to the exemptions list which can allow data transfer exceptions. For additional details and examples, see [How to create exceptions to the Intune App Protection Policy (APP) data transfer policy](../apps/app-protection-policies-exception.md). The exempt unmanaged app must be invoked based on iOS URL protocol. For example, when data transfer exemption is added for an unmanaged app, it would still prevent users from cut, copy, and paste operations, if restricted by policy. This type of exemption would also prevent users from using **Open-in** action within a managed app to copy data to exempt app since it is not based on iOS URL protocol. For more information about **Open-in**, see [Use app protection with iOS apps](../apps/data-transfer-between-apps-manage-ios.md#use-open-in-management-to-protect-ios-apps-and-data).

| App/service name(s) | Description |
| ---- | --- |
| <code>skype</code> | Skype |
| <code>app-settings</code> | Device settings |
| <code>itms; itmss; itms-apps; itms-appss; itms-services</code> | App Store |
| <code>calshow</code> | Native Calendar |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> App Protection policies created before June 15, 2020 include *tel* and *telprompt* URL scheme as part of the default data transfer exemptions. These URL schemes allow managed apps to initiate the dialer. The App Protection policy setting **Transfer telecommunication data to** has replaced this functionality. Administrators should remove *tel;telprompt;* from the data transfer exemptions and rely on the App Protection policy setting, provided the managed apps that initiate dialer functionality include the Intune SDK 12.7.0 or later.
> [!IMPORTANT]
> In Intune SDK 14.5.0 or later, including *sms* and *mailto* URL schemes in the data transfer exemptions will also allow sharing of Org data to the MFMessageCompose (for *sms*) and MFMailCompose (for *mailto*) view controllers within policy managed applications.  

## Universal Links

Universal links allow the user to directly launch an application associated with the link instead of a protected browser specified by the **Restrict web content transfer with other apps** setting. You must contact the application developer to determine correct universal link format for each application.

### Exempt Universal Links

By adding Universal Links to *unmanaged* apps, you can launch the specified application. To add the app, you must add the link to the exemption list.

> [!CAUTION]
> The target applications for these Universal Links are unmanaged and adding an exemption may result in data security leaks.

The default app Universal Link exemptions are the following:

| App Universal Link | Description |
|---|---|
| `http://maps.apple.com;` `https://maps.apple.com` | Maps App |
| `http://facetime.apple.com;` `https://facetime.apple.com` | FaceTime App |

If you don't want to allow the default Universal Link exemptions, you can delete them. You can also add Universal Links for third party or LOB apps. The exempted universal links allow for wildcards such as `http://*.sharepoint-df.com/*`.

### Managed Universal Links

By adding Universal Links to *managed* apps, you can launch the specified application securely. To add the app, you must add the link to the managed list. If the target application has an App Protection policy applied, selecting the link will launch the app. If the target application does not have an App Protection policy applied, selecting the link will launch the protected browser.

The default managed Universal Links are the following:

| Managed App Universal Link | Description |
|---|---|
| `http://*.onedrive.com/*;` `https://*.onedrive.com/*;` | OneDrive |
| `http://*.appsplatform.us/*;` `http://*.powerapps.cn/*;` `http://*.powerapps.com/*;` `http://*.powerapps.us/*;` `https://*.powerbi.com/*;` `https://app.powerbi.cn/*;` `https://app.powerbigov.us/*;` `https://app.powerbi.de/*;` | PowerApps |

| `http://*.yammer.com/*;` `https://*.yammer.com/*;` | Yammer |
| `http://*.zoom.us/*;` `https://*.zoom.us/*;` | Zoom |

If you don't want to allow the default managed Universal Links, you can delete them. You can also add Universal Links for third party or LOB apps.

## Access requirements

| Setting | How to use | Default value |
|------|----------|-------|
| **PIN for access** | Select **Require** to require a PIN to use this app. The user is prompted to set up this PIN the first time they run the app in a work or school context. The PIN is applied when working either online or offline.    <br><br> You can configure the PIN strength using the settings available under the **PIN for access** section.   | **Require** |
| <ul> **PIN type** | Set a requirement for either numeric or passcode type PINs before accessing an app that has app protection policies applied. Numeric requirements involve only numbers, while a passcode can be defined with at least 1 alphabetical letter **or** at least 1 special character.  <br><br> **Note:** *To configure passcode type, it requires app to have Intune SDK version 7.1.12 or above. Numeric type has no Intune SDK version restriction. Special characters allowed include the special characters and symbols on the iOS/iPadOS English language keyboard.*  | **Numeric**  |
| <ul> **Simple PIN** | Select **Allow** to allow users to use simple PIN sequences like 1234, 1111, abcd or aaaa. Select **Block** to prevent them from using simple sequences. Simple sequences are checked in 3 character sliding windows. If **Block** is configured, 1235 or 1112 would not be accepted as PIN set by the end user, but 1122 would be allowed. <br><br>**Note**: *If Passcode type PIN is configured, and Allow simple PIN is set to Yes, the user needs at least 1 letter **or** at least 1 special character in their PIN. If Passcode type PIN is configured, and Allow simple PIN is set to No, the user needs at least 1 number **and** 1 letter **and** at least 1 special character in their PIN.*   |**Allow**  |
| <ul> **Select minimum PIN length** | Specify the minimum number of digits in a PIN sequence.  | **4**  |
| <ul> **Touch ID instead of PIN for access (iOS 8+)** | Select **Allow** to allow the user to use [Touch ID](https://support.apple.com/HT201371) instead of a PIN for app access.    | **Allow**  |
|<ul><ul>**Override Touch ID with PIN after timeout**|  To use this setting, select **Require** and then configure an inactivity timeout.  |**Require**  |
| <ul><ul><ul> **Timeout (minutes of inactivity)** |  Specify a time in minutes after which either a passcode or numeric (as configured) PIN will override the use of a fingerprint or face as method of access. This timeout value should be greater than the value specified under 'Recheck the access requirements after (minutes of inactivity)'.  |**30**  |
| <ul><ul>**Face ID instead of PIN for access (iOS 11+)** | Select **Allow** to allow the user to use facial recognition technology to authenticate users on iOS/iPadOS devices. If allowed, Face ID must be used to access the app on a Face ID capable device.    | **Allow**  |
| <ul>**PIN reset after number of days** | Select **Yes** to require users to change their app PIN after a set period of time, in days.  <br><br>When set to *Yes*, you then configure the number of days before the PIN reset is required. |**No**  |  
| <ul><ul> **Number of days** | Configure the number of days before the PIN reset is required.  |**90**  |
| <ul>**App PIN when device PIN is set** | Select **Disable** to disable the app PIN when a device lock is detected on an enrolled device with Company Portal configured.<br><br> **Note:** *Requires app to have Intune SDK version 7.0.1 or above.*  <br><br>On iOS/iPadOS devices, you can let the user prove their identity by using [Touch ID](https://support.apple.com/HT201371) or [Face ID](https://support.apple.com/HT208109) instead of a PIN. Intune uses the [LocalAuthentication](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/localauthentication/) API to authenticate users using Touch ID and Face ID. To learn more about Touch ID and Face ID, see the [iOS Security Guide](https://www.apple.com/business/docs/iOS_Security_Guide.pdf).  <br><br> When the user tries to use this app with their work or school account, they're prompted to provide their fingerprint identity or face identity instead of entering a PIN. When this setting is enabled, the App-switcher preview image will be blurred while using a work or school account. If there is any change to the device's biometric database, Intune prompts the user for a PIN when the next inactivity timeout value is met. Changes to biometric data include the addition or removal of a fingerprint or face for authentication. If the Intune user does not have a PIN set, they are led to set up an Intune PIN.  |  **Enable** |  
| **Work or school account credentials for access** | Select **Require** to require the user to sign in with their work or school account instead of entering a PIN for app access. If you set this to **Require**, and PIN or biometric prompts are turned on, both corporate credentials and either the PIN or biometric prompts are shown.  | **Not required** |
| **Recheck the access requirements after (minutes of inactivity)** | Configure the number of minutes of inactivity that must pass before the app requires the user to again specify the access requirements. <br><br> For example, an admin turns on PIN and Blocks rooted devices in the policy, a user opens an Intune-managed app, must enter a PIN, and must be using the app on a non-rooted device. When using this setting, the user would not have to enter a PIN or undergo another root-detection check on any Intune-managed app for a period of time equal to the configured value.  <br><br>**Note:** *On iOS/iPadOS, the PIN is shared amongst all Intune-managed apps of the **same publisher**. The PIN timer for a specific PIN is reset once the app leaves the foreground on the device. The user wouldn't have to enter a PIN on any Intune-managed app that shares its PIN for the duration of the timeout defined in this setting.

> To learn more about how multiple Intune app protection settings configured in the Access section to the same set of apps and users work on iOS/iPadOS, see [Intune MAM frequently asked questions](mam-faq.yml) and [Selectively wipe data using app protection policy access actions in Intune](app-protection-policies-access-actions.md).

## Conditional launch
Configure conditional launch settings to set sign-in security requirements for your access protection policy. 

By default, several settings are provided with pre-configured values and actions. You can delete some of these, like the *Min OS version*. You can also select additional settings from the **Select one** dropdown. 

| Setting | How to use |  
|---------|------------| 
| **Max OS version** | Specify a maximum iOS/iPadOS operating system to use this app. *Actions* include: <br><ul><li>**Warn** - The user will see a notification if the iOS/iPadOS version on the device doesn't meet the requirement. This notification can be dismissed. </li><li>**Block access** - The user will be blocked from access if the iOS/iPadOS version on the device doesn't meet this requirement.</li><li>**Wipe data** - The user account that is associated with the application is wiped from the device.  </li></ul><br>This entry can appear multiple times, with each instance supporting a different action.<br><br> This policy setting format supports either major.minor, major.minor.build, major.minor.build.revision. <br><br>**Note:** *Requires app to have Intune SDK version 14.4.0 or above.* |
| **Min OS version** | Specify a minimum iOS/iPadOS operating system to use this app. *Actions* include: <br><ul><li>**Warn** - The user will see a notification if the iOS/iPadOS version on the device doesn't meet the requirement. This notification can be dismissed. </li></ul> <ul><li>**Block access** - The user will be blocked from access if the iOS/iPadOS version on the device doesn't meet this requirement.</li></ul> <ul><li>**Wipe data** - The user account that is associated with the application is wiped from the device.  </li></ul> </li></ul>This entry can appear multiple times, with each instance supporting a different action.<br><br> This policy setting format supports either major.minor, major.minor.build, major.minor.build.revision. <br><br>**Note:** *Requires app to have Intune SDK version 7.0.1 or above.* |
| **Max PIN attempts** | Specify the number of tries the user has to successfully enter their PIN before the configured action is taken. If the user fails to successfully enter their PIN after the maximum PIN attempts, the user must reset their pin after successfully logging into their account and completing a multi-factor authentication (MFA) challenge if required. This policy setting format supports a positive whole number. *Actions* include: <br><ul><li>**Reset PIN** - The user must reset their PIN.</li></ul> <ul><li>**Wipe data** - The user account that is associated with the application is wiped from the device.  </li></ul></li></ul> Default value = **5** |
| **Offline grace period** | The number of minutes that policy-managed apps can run offline. Specify the time (in minutes) before the access requirements for the app are rechecked. *Actions* include: <br><ul><li>**Block access (minutes)** - The number of minutes that policy-managed apps can run offline. Specify the time (in minutes) before the access requirements for the app are rechecked. After the configured period expires, the app blocks access to work or school data until network access is available. The Offline grace period timer for blocking access is shared across all apps in the app publisher keychain. This policy-setting format supports a positive whole number.<br><br>Default value = **720** minutes (12 hours) </li></ul> <ul><li>**Wipe data (days)** - After this many days (defined by the admin) of running offline, the app will require the user to connect to the network and reauthenticate. If the user successfully authenticates, they can continue to access their data and the offline interval will reset.  If the user fails to authenticate, the app will perform a selective wipe of the users' account and data.  See [How to wipe only corporate data from Intune-managed apps](apps-selective-wipe.md) for more information on what data is removed with a selective wipe. The Offline grace period timer for wiping data is calculated individually for each app based on last check-in with the Intune service. This policy setting format supports a positive whole number. <br><br> Default value = **90 days** </li></ul>  This entry can appear multiple times, with each instance supporting a different action. |
| **Jailbroken/rooted devices** | There is no value to set for this setting. *Actions* include: <br><ul><li>**Block access** - Prevent this app from running on jailbroken or rooted devices. The user continues to be able to use this app for personal tasks, but must use a different device to access work or school data in this app.</li></ul> <ul><li>**Wipe data**  - The user account that is associated with the application is wiped from the device. </li></ul> |
| **Disabled account** | There is no value to set for this setting. *Actions* include: <br><ul><li>**Block access** - When we have confirmed the user has been disabled in Azure Active Directory, the app blocks access to work or school data.</li></ul> <ul><li>**Wipe data**  - When we have confirmed the user has been disabled in Azure Active Directory, the app will perform a selective wipe of the users' account and data. </li></ul> |
| **Min app version** | Specify a value for the minimum application version value. *Actions* include: <br><ul><li>**Warn** - The user sees a notification if the app version on the device doesn't meet the requirement. This notification can be dismissed.</li></ul> <ul><li>**Block access** - The user is blocked from access if the app version on the device doesn't meet the requirement. </li></ul> <ul><li>**Wipe data** - The user account that is associated with the application is wiped from the device. </li></ul> </li></ul>   As apps often have distinct versioning schemes between them, create a policy with one minimum app version targeting one app (for example, *Outlook version policy*).<br><br> This entry can appear multiple times, with each instance supporting a different action.<br><br> This policy setting format supports either major.minor, major.minor.build, major.minor.build.revision.<br><br> **Note:** *Requires app to have Intune SDK version 7.0.1 or above.*<br><br> Additionally, you can configure **where** your end users can get an updated version of a line-of-business (LOB) app. End users will see this in the **min app version** conditional launch dialog, which will prompt end users to update to a minimum version of the LOB app. On iOS/iPadOS, this feature requires the app to be integrated (or wrapped using the wrapping tool) with the Intune SDK for iOS v. 10.0.7 or above. To configure where an end user should update a LOB app, the app needs a managed [app configuration policy](app-configuration-policies-managed-app.md) sent to it with the key, `com.microsoft.intune.myappstore`. The value sent will define which store the end user will download the app from. If the app is deployed via the Company Portal, the value must be `CompanyPortal`. For any other store, you must enter a complete URL. |
| **Min SDK version** | Specify a minimum value for the Intune SDK version. *Actions* include: <br><ul><li>**Block access** - The user is blocked from access if the app's Intune app protection policy SDK version doesn't meet the requirement. </li></ul><ul><li>**Wipe data** - The user account that is associated with the application is wiped from the device. </li></ul></li></ul>To learn more about the Intune app protection policy SDK, see [Intune App SDK overview](../developer/app-sdk.md). As apps often have distinct Intune SDK version between them, create a policy with one min Intune SDK version targeting one app (for example, *Intune SDK version policy for Outlook*). <br><br> This entry can appear multiple times, with each instance supporting a different action.|
| **Device model(s)** | Specify a semi-colon separated list of model identifier(s). These values are not case sensitive. *Actions* include: <br><ul><li>**Allow specified (Block non-specified)** - Only devices that match the specified device model can use the app. All other device models are blocked. </li></ul> <ul><li>**Allow specified (Wipe non-specified)** - The user account that is associated with the application is wiped from the device.</li></ul> For more information on using this setting, see [Conditional Launch actions](app-protection-policies-access-actions.md#ios-policy-settings). |
| **Max allowed device threat level** | App protection policies can take advantage of the Intune-MTD connector. Specify a maximum threat level acceptable to use this app. Threats are determined by your chosen Mobile Threat Defense (MTD) vendor app on the end user device. Specify either *Secured*, *Low*, *Medium*, or *High*. *Secured* requires no threats on the device and is the most restrictive configurable value, while *High* essentially requires an active Intune-to-MTD connection. *Actions* include: <br><ul><li>**Block access** - The user will be blocked from access if the threat level determined by your chosen Mobile Threat Defense (MTD) vendor app on the end user device doesn't meet this requirement.</li></ul><ul><li>**Wipe data** - The user account that is associated with the application is wiped from the device.</li></ul>**Note:** *Requires app to have Intune SDK version 12.0.15 or above.* <br><br> For more information on using this setting, see [Enable MTD for unenrolled devices](../protect/mtd-enable-unenrolled-devices.md). |
