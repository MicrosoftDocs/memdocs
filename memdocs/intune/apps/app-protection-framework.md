# Data protection framework using app protection policies 

As more organizations implement mobile device strategies for accessing work or school data, protecting against data leakage becomes paramount. Intune's mobile application management solution for protecting against data leakage is App Protection Policies (APP). APP are rules that ensure an organization's data remains safe or contained in a managed app, regardless of whether the device is enrolled. For more information, see [App protection policies overview](app-protection-policy.md).

When configuring App Protection Policies, the number of various settings and options enable organizations to tailor the protection to their specific needs. Due to this flexibility, it may not be obvious which permutation of policy settings are required to implement a complete scenario. To help organizations prioritize client endpoint hardening endeavors, Microsoft has introduced a new taxonomy for [security configurations in Windows 10](https://aka.ms/secconframework), and Intune is leveraging a similar taxonomy for its APP data protection framework for mobile app management.  

The APP data protection configuration framework is organized into three distinct configuration scenarios:

- Level 1 enterprise basic data protection – Microsoft recommends this configuration as the minimum data protection configuration for an enterprise device.

- Level 2 enterprise enhanced data protection – Microsoft recommends this configuration for devices where users access sensitive or confidential information. This configuration is applicable to most mobile users accessing work or school data. Some of the controls may impact user experience.

- Level 3 enterprise high data protection – Microsoft recommends this configuration for devices run by an organization with a larger or more sophisticated security team, or for specific users or groups who are at uniquely high risk (users who handle highly sensitive data where unauthorized disclosure causes considerable material loss to the organization). An organization likely to be targeted by well-funded and sophisticated adversaries should aspire to this configuration.

## APP Data Protection Framework deployment methodology

As with any deployment of new software, features or settings, Microsoft recommends investing in a ring methodology for testing validation prior to deploying the APP data protection framework. Defining deployment rings is generally a one-time event (or at least infrequent), but IT should revisit these groups to ensure that the sequencing is still correct.

Microsoft recommends the following deployment ring approach for the APP data protection framework:

| Deployment ring  | Tenant  | Assessment teams  | Output  | Timeline  |
|--------------------|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Quality Assurance  | Preproduction tenant  | Mobile capability owners, Security, Risk Assessment, Privacy, UX  | Functional scenario validation, draft documentation  | 0-30 days  |
| Preview  | Production tenant  | Mobile capability owners, UX  | End-user scenario validation, user facing documentation  | 7-14 days, post Quality Assurance  |
| Production  | Production tenant  | Mobile capability owners, IT help desk  | N/A  | 7 days to several weeks, post Preview  |

As the above table indicates, all changes to the App Protection Policies should be first performed in a preproduction environment to understand the policy setting implications. Once testing is complete, the changes can be moved into production and applied to a subset of production users, generally, the IT department and other applicable groups. And finally, the rollout can be completed to the rest of the mobile user community. Roll out to production may take a longer amount of time depending on the scale of impact regarding the change. If there's no user impact, the change should roll out quickly, whereas, if the change results in user impact, rollout may need to go slower due to the need to communicate changes to the user population.

When testing changes to an APP, be aware of the [delivery timing](app-protection-policy-delivery.md). The status of APP delivery for a given user can be monitored. For more information, see [How to monitor app protection policies](app-protection-policies-monitor.md).

Individual APP settings for each app can be validated on devices using Microsoft Edge and the URL *about:Intunehelp*. For more information, see [Review client app protection logs](app-protection-policy-settings-log.md) and [Use Microsoft Edge for iOS and Android to access managed app logs](manage-microsoft-edge.md#use-microsoft-edge-for-ios-and-android-to-access-managed-app-logs).

## APP Data Protection Framework settings

The following App Protection Policy settings should be enabled for the applicable apps and assigned to all mobile users. For more information on each policy setting, see [iOS app protection policy settings](app-protection-policy-settings-ios.md) and [Android app protection policy settings](app-protection-policy-settings-android.md).

Microsoft recommends reviewing and categorizing usage scenarios, and then configuring users using the prescriptive guidance for that level. As with any framework, settings within a corresponding level may need to be adjusted based on the needs of the organization as data protection must evaluate the threat environment, risk appetite, and impact to usability.

Administrators can incorporate the below configuration levels within their ring deployment methodology for testing and production use by importing the sample [Intune App Protection Policy Configuration Framework JSON templates](https://github.com/microsoft/Intune-Config-Frameworks/tree/master/AppProtectionPolicies) with [Intune's PowerShell scripts](https://github.com/microsoftgraph/powershell-intune-samples).

> [!NOTE]
> Preview: When using MAM for Windows, see [App protection policy settings for Windows](../apps/app-protection-policy-settings-windows.md).

### Conditional Access Policies

To ensure that only apps supporting App Protection Polices access work or school account data, Microsoft Entra Conditional Access policies are required. These policies are described in [Conditional Access: Require approved client apps or app protection policy](/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/howto-policy-approved-app-or-app-protection).

 See **Require approved client apps or app protection policy with mobile devices** in [Conditional Access: Require approved client apps or app protection policy](/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/howto-policy-approved-app-or-app-protection) for steps to implement the specific policies. Finally, implement the steps in [Block legacy authentication](/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/block-legacy-authentication) to block legacy authentication capable iOS and Android apps.

> [!NOTE]
> These policies leverage the grant controls [Require approved client app](/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/concept-conditional-access-grant#require-approved-client-app) and [Require app protection policy](/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/concept-conditional-access-grant#require-app-protection-policy).

### Apps to include in the App Protection Policies  

For each App Protection Policy, the Core Microsoft Apps group is targeted, which includes the following apps:

- Microsoft Edge
- Excel
- Office
- OneDrive
- OneNote
- Outlook
- PowerPoint
- SharePoint
- Teams
- To Do
- Word

The policies should include other Microsoft apps based on business need, additional third-party public apps that have integrated the Intune SDK used within the organization, as well as line-of-business apps that have integrated the [Intune SDK](../developer/app-sdk.md) (or have been wrapped).

### Level 1 enterprise basic data protection

Level 1 is the minimum data protection configuration for an enterprise mobile device. This configuration replaces the need for basic Exchange Online device access policies by requiring a PIN to access work or school data, encrypting the work or school account data, and providing the capability to selectively wipe the school or work data. However, unlike Exchange Online device access policies, the below App Protection Policy settings apply to all the apps selected in the policy, thereby ensuring data access is protected beyond mobile messaging scenarios.

The policies in level 1 enforce a reasonable data access level while minimizing the impact to users and mirror the default data protection and access requirements settings when creating an App Protection Policy within Microsoft Intune.

| Device conditions  |       Require device lock  |        Low/Warn |         Android  |          This setting ensures that Android devices have a device password that meets the minimum password requirements.                |

#### Level 2 enterprise enhanced data protection

Level 2 is the data protection configuration recommended as a standard for devices where users access more sensitive information. These devices are a natural target in enterprises today. These recommendations don't assume a large staff of highly skilled security practitioners, and therefore should be accessible to most enterprise organizations. This configuration expands upon the configuration in Level 1 by restricting data transfer scenarios and by requiring a minimum operating system version.

The policy settings enforced in level 2 include all the policy settings recommended for level 1 but only lists those settings below that have been added or changed to implement more controls and a more sophisticated configuration than level 1. While these settings may have a slightly higher impact to users or to applications, they enforce a level of data protection more commensurate with the risks facing users with access to sensitive information on mobile devices.

Devices that were upgraded from an older version of Android to Android 8.1 are unlikely to have the hardware-based components necessary for hardware backed attestation. While this setting should be widely supported starting with devices that shipped with Android 8.1, Microsoft strongly recommends testing devices individually before enabling this policy setting broadly.</p>  |

This setting verifies all Intune MAM client responses to the Intune service were sent from a healthy device.  <p> This setting will apply to all devices targeted.  To apply this setting only to Samsung devices, you can use "Managed apps" assignment filters.  For more information on assignment filters, see [Use filters when assigning your apps, policies, and profiles in Microsoft Intune](../fundamentals/filters.md).|

#### Level 3 enterprise high data protection

Level 3 is the data protection configuration recommended as a standard for organizations with large and sophisticated security organizations, or for specific users and groups who will be uniquely targeted by adversaries. Such organizations are typically targeted by well-funded and sophisticated adversaries, and as such merit the additional constraints and controls described. This configuration expands upon the configuration in Level 2 by restricting additional data transfer scenarios, increasing the complexity of the PIN configuration, and adding mobile threat detection.  

The policy settings enforced in level 3 include all the policy settings recommended for level 2 but only lists those settings below that have been added or changed to implement more controls and a more sophisticated configuration than level 2. These policy settings can have a potentially significant impact to users or to applications, enforcing a level of security commensurate with the risks facing targeted organizations.
