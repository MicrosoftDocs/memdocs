| Error   code (Hex) | Error code (Dec) | Error   message/code | Description |
|--------------------|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 0xC7D14FB5 | -942583883 | The   app failed to install.  | This   error message is displayed when Intune cannot determine the root cause of the   Android app installation error. No information was provided by Android during   the failure. This error is returned when the APK download succeeded, but the   app installation failed. This error may occur more commonly due to a bad APK   file that cannot be installed onto the device. A possible cause can be when   Google Play Protect blocks the install of the app due to security concerns.   Another possible cause of this error is when a device does not support the   app. For example, if the app requires API version 21+ and the device   currently has API version 19. Intune returns this error for both DA and KNOX   devices and although there may be a notification that users can click to retry,   if there is an issue with the APK, it will never continue to fail. If the app   is an available app, the notification can be dismissed. However, if the app   is required, it cannot be dismissed. |
| 0xC7D14FBA | -942583878 | The   app installation was canceled because the installation (APK) file was deleted   after download, but before installation.  | The   download of the APK succeeded, but before the user installed the app the file   was removed from the device. This could happen if there was a large time   difference between download and install. For example, the user canceled the   original install, waited, and then clicked the notification to try again.   This error message is returned this for only DA scenarios. KNOX scenarios can   be done silently. We do present a notification to retry so the user can   accept instead of cancel. If the app is an available app, the notification   can be dismissed. However, if the app is required, it cannot be dismissed. |
| 0xC7D14FBB | -942583877 | The   app installation was canceled because the process was restarted during   installation.  | The   device was rebooted during the APK installation process, resulting in a   canceled installation. This error message is returned for both DA and KNOX   devices. Intune presents a notification that users can click to retry. If the   app is an available app, the notification can be dismissed. However, if the   app is required, it cannot be dismissed. |
| 0x87D1041C | -2016345060 | The   application was not detected after installation completed successfully.  | The   user explicitly uninstalled the app. This error is not returned from the   client. It is an error produced when the app was installed at one point, but   then the user uninstalled it. This error should only occur for required   applications. Users can uninstall non-required apps. This error can only   happen in DA. KNOX blocks the uninstall of managed apps. The next sync will   repost the notification on the device for the user to install. The user can   ignore the notification. This error will continue to be reported until the   user installs the app. |
| 0xC7D14FB2 | -942583886 | The   download failed because of an unknown error.  | This   error occurs when the download fails. This error can commonly occur due to   Wi-Fi issues or slow connections. This error is returned for only DA   scenarios. For KNOX scenarios, the user is not prompted to install, this can   be done silently. Intune presents a notification that users can click to   retry. If the app is an available app, the notification can be dismissed.   However, if the app is required, it cannot be dismissed. |
| 0xC7D15078 | -942583688 | The   download failed because of an unknown error. The policy will be retried the   next time the device syncs.  | This   error occurs when the download fails. This error can commonly occur due to   Wi-Fi issues or slow connections. This error is returned for only DA   scenarios. For KNOX scenarios, the user is not prompted to install, this can   be done silently. |
| 0xC7D14FB1 | -942583887 | The   end user canceled the app installation.  | The   user explicitly uninstalled the app. This error is returned when the Android   OS install activity was canceled by the user. The user pressed the cancel   button when the OS install prompt was presented or clicked away from the   prompt. This error is returned for only DA scenarios. For KNOX scenarios, the   user is not prompted to install, this can be done silently. Intune presents a   notification that users can click to retry. If the app is an available app,   the notification can be dismissed. However, if the app is required, it cannot   be dismissed. Ask the user not to cancel the install. |
| 0xC7D15015 | -942583787 | The   file download process was unexpectedly stopped.  | The   OS stopped the download process before it was complete. This error can occur   when the device has low battery or the download is taking too long. This   error is returned for only DA scenarios. For KNOX scenarios, the user is not   prompted to install, this can be done silently. Intune presents a   notification that users can click to retry. If the app is an available app,   the notification can be dismissed. However, if the app is required, it cannot   be dismissed. Ensure the device has a reliable network connection. |
| 0xC7D1507C | -942583684 | The   file download service was unexpectedly stopped. The policy will be retried   the next time the device syncs.  | The   OS ended the download process before it was completed. This error can occur   when the device has low battery or the download is taking too long. This   error is returned for only DA scenarios. For KNOX scenarios, the user is not   prompted to install, this can be done silently. Manually sync the device or   wait for 24 hours and check the status. |
| 0xc7d14fb8 | -942583880 | The   app failed to uninstall.  | This   error is a generic uninstall failure. The OS did not specify why the app   failed to uninstall. Some admin apps cannot simply be uninstalled. Check to   ensure the app can be uninstalled manually and collect the Company Portal   logs if the uninstall fails. |
| 0xc7d14fb7 | -942583881 | The   app installation APK file used for the upgrade does not match the signature   for the current app on the device.  | Android   OS has the limitation of requiring the signing cert for the upgrade version   to be exactly the same as the cert used to sign the existing version. If the   developer cannot use the same cert to sign the new version, you will need to   uninstall the existing app and re-deploy the new app rather than upgrade the   existing app. |
| 0xc7d14fb9 | -942583879 | The   end user canceled the app installation.  | Educate   the user to accept the Intune deployed app and install the app when prompted. |
| 0xc7d14fbc | -942583876 | Uninstall   of the app was canceled because the process was restarted during   installation.  | The   app install process was terminated by the OS or the device was restarted.   Retry the install and collect Company Portal logs if this error occurs again. |
| 0xc7d14fb6 | -942583882 | The   app installation APK file cannot be installed because it was not signed.  | By   default, Android OS requires apps to be signed. Ensure the app is signed   before deployment. |
| 0xC7D14FB1  | -942583887 | The   end user canceled the app installation. | The   user explicitly uninstalled the app. This error is returned when the Android   OS install activity was canceled by the user. The user pressed the cancel   button when the OS install prompt was presented or clicked away from the   prompt. This error is returned for only DA scenarios. For KNOX scenarios, the   user is not prompted to install, this can be done silently. Intune presents a   notification that users can click to retry. If the app is an available app,   the notification can be dismissed. However, if the app is required, it cannot   be dismissed. Ask the user not to cancel the install. |
| 0xC7D14FB9 | -942583879 | The   end user canceled the app installation. (At the accept prompt) | Educate the user to accept the Intune deployed app and install   the app when prompted. |
