# Microsoft Intune protected apps  

The apps listed in this topic are supported partner and Microsoft apps that are commonly used with Microsoft Intune. Intune protected apps are enabled with a rich set of mobile application protection policies. These apps allow you to:

- Restrict copy-and-paste and save-as functions
- Configure web links to open inside the secure Microsoft browser
- Enable multi-identity use and app-level Conditional Access
- Apply data loss prevention policies without managing the user's device
- Enable app protection without requiring enrollment
- Enable app protection on devices managed with 3rd party EMM tools

> [!NOTE]
> For your client line-of-business apps, you can incorporate mobile app management using the [Intune App Software Development Kit](../developer/app-sdk.md) (SDK), or the [App Wrapping Tool for iOS](../developer/app-wrapper-prepare-ios.md) and the [App Wrapping Tool for Android](../developer/app-wrapper-prepare-android.md).
