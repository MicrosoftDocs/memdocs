# Microsoft Intune protected apps  

The apps listed in this topic are supported partner and Microsoft apps that are commonly used with Microsoft Intune. Intune protected apps are enabled with a rich set of mobile application protection policies.

> [!NOTE]
> For your client line-of-business apps, you can incorporate mobile app management using the [Intune App Software Development Kit](../developer/app-sdk.md) (SDK), or the [App Wrapping Tool for iOS](../developer/app-wrapper-prepare-ios.md) and the [App Wrapping Tool for Android](../developer/app-wrapper-prepare-android.md).

The following tables provide details of supported partner and Microsoft apps that are commonly used with Microsoft Intune. These apps support the **core App Protection Policy settings** which are defined as:

- Protecting work or school account data while leaving personal data untouched in apps that support multi-identity
- Restricting data transfer and copy-and-paste functions
- Encrypting work or school account data
- Configuring work or school account web links to open inside a managed browser, like Microsoft Edge
- Enforcing access requirements to access work or school account data
- Enforcing conditional launch behaviors to protect the work or school account data
- Applying data loss prevention policies without managing the user's device
- Enabling app protection without requiring enrollment
- Enabling app protection on devices managed with third-party Unified Endpoint Management solutions

In addition to supporting the core App Protection Policy settings, apps are also capable of supporting **advanced App Protection Policy and App Configuration Policy** settings. These settings require app investment:

- App Configuration Policies can be used by apps to customize app behavior and/or App Protection Policy settings.
- On enrolled devices, managed apps can leverage *org allowed accounts mode* to require sign-in with a specific identity and disable multi-identity functionality.
- The *Sync policy managed app data with native apps* App Protection Policy setting can be utilized by apps to restrict the synchronization of contact or calendar data to the native apps.
- The *Org data notifications* App Protection Policy setting can be utilized by apps to limit the exposure of sensitive data in notifications.
- The *Open data into Org documents* App Protection Policy setting can be utilized by apps to restrict importing data from unmanaged locations.
- The *Save copies of org data* App Protection Policy setting can be utilized by apps to restrict which locations can be used when saving work or school account data.
