# Quiet time policies for iOS/iPadOS and Android apps

[!INCLUDE [azure_portal](../includes/azure_portal.md)]

The global quiet time settings allow you to create policies to schedule quiet time for your end users. These settings automatically mute Microsoft Outlook email and Teams notifications on iOS/iPadOS and Android platforms. These policies can be used to limit end user notifications received after work hours.

## Quiet time policy types

There are three quiet time policy types available. The following table describes each policy type.

|      Policy Type     |      Description     |
|---|---|
|     Date Range    |     Select this option to automatically mute Microsoft Outlook  email and Teams notifications on iOS/iPadOS and Android platforms during the   specified range.    |
|     Days of the week    |     Select this option to automatically mute Microsoft Outlook   email and Teams notifications on iOS/iPadOS and Android platforms during   certain hours or all day on selected days of the week.    |
|     Non-working time     | Select this option to automatically mute Microsoft Teams notifications on iOS/iPadOS and Android platforms when the managed account is in non-working time.<p>**Note**: This setting must only be configured if the tenant has been integrated with the **Working Time API**. For more information on integrating with the **Working Time API**, see [Limit access to Microsoft Teams when frontline workers are off shift](/microsoft-365/frontline/flw-working-time). Configuring this setting without integrating with the Working Time API could result in accounts missing Teams app notifications due to missing working time status for the managed account.      |

8. The **Scope tags** page allows you to optionally add scope tags for the app. For more information, see [Use role-based access control (RBAC) and scope tags for distributed IT](../fundamentals/scope-tags.md).<br>Select **Next** to display the **Assignments** page.
