# What is Microsoft Intune app management?

As an IT admin, you can use Microsoft Intune to manage the client apps that your company's workforce uses. This functionality is in addition to managing devices and protecting data. One of an admin's priorities is to ensure that end users have access to the apps they need to do their work. This goal can be a challenge because:
- There are a wide range of device platforms and app types.
- You might need to manage apps on both company devices and users' personal devices.
- You must ensure that your network and your data remain secure.

Additionally, you might want to assign and manage apps on devices that are not enrolled with Intune.<p>

## Mobile Application Management (MAM) basics

[Intune mobile application management](app-lifecycle.md) refers to the suite of Intune management features that lets you publish, push, configure, secure, monitor, and update mobile apps for your users.

MAM allows you to manage and protects your organization's data within an application. With **MAM without enrollment** (MAM-WE), a work or school-related app that contains sensitive data can be managed on almost any [device](app-management.md#app-management-capabilities-by-platform), including personal devices in **bring-your-own-device** (BYOD) scenarios. Many productivity apps, such as the Microsoft Office apps, can be managed by Intune MAM. See the official list of [Microsoft Intune protected apps](apps-supported-intune-apps.md) available for public use.

Intune MAM supports two configurations:

- **Intune MDM + MAM**: IT administrators can only manage apps using MAM and app protection policies on devices that are enrolled with Intune mobile device management (MDM). To manage apps using MDM + MAM, customers should use Intune in the [Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431).
- **MAM without device enrollment**: MAM without device enrollment, or MAM-WE, allows IT administrators to manage apps using MAM and app protection policies on devices not enrolled with Intune MDM. This means apps can be managed by Intune on devices enrolled with third-party EMM providers. To manage apps using MAM-WE, customers should use Intune in the [Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431). Also, apps can be managed by Intune on devices enrolled with third-party Enterprise Mobility Management (EMM) providers or not enrolled with an MDM at all. For more information about BYOD and Microsoft's EMS, see [Technology decisions for enabling BYOD with Microsoft Enterprise Mobility + Security (EMS)](../fundamentals/byod-technology-decisions.md).

## App management capabilities by platform

Intune offers a range of capabilities to help you get the apps you need on the devices you want to run them on. The following table provides a summary of app management capabilities.

| App Management Capability | Android/Android Enterprise | iOS/iPadOS | macOS | Windows 10 |
|-------------------------- | -------------------------- | ---------- | ----- | ---------- |
| Add and assign   apps to devices and users | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Assign apps to   devices not enrolled with Intune | Yes | Yes | No | No |
| Use app   configuration policies to control the startup behavior of apps | Yes | Yes | No | No |
| Use mobile app   provisioning policies to renew expired apps | No | Yes | No | No |
| Protect company   data in apps with app protection policies | Yes | Yes | No | No <sup>1</sup> |
| Remove only   corporate data from an installed app (app selective wipe) | Yes | Yes | No | Yes |
| Monitor app   assignments | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Assign and   track volume-purchased apps from an app store | No | No | No | Yes |
| Mandatory   install of apps on devices (required) <sup>2</sup> | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Optional   installation on devices from the Company Portal (available installation) | Yes <sup>3</sup> | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Install   shortcut to an app on the web (web link) | Yes <sup>4</sup> | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| In-house   (line-of-business) apps | Yes <sup>5</sup>| Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Apps from a   store | Yes | Yes | No | Yes |

<sup>1</sup> Consider using [Windows Information Protection](../protect/windows-information-protection-configure.md) to protect apps on devices that run Windows 10.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Applies to devices managed by Intune only.<br>
<sup>3</sup> Intune supports available apps from Managed Google Play store on Android Enterprise devices.<br>
<sup>4</sup> Intune does not provide installing a shortcut to an app as a web link on standard Android Enterprise devices. However, Web link support is provided for [multi-app dedicated Android Enterprise devices](../configuration/device-restrictions-android-for-work.md#device-experience).<br> 
<sup>5</sup> LOB for AE are supported, but the apps need to be published privately to Managed Play.

## Get started

You can find most app-related information in the **Apps** workload, which you can access by doing the following:

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431).
3. Select **Apps**.

    ![The Apps workload pane](./media/app-management/apps-workload.png)

The apps workload provides links to access common app information and functionality. 

The top of the App workload navigation menu provide commonly used app details:
- **Overview**: Select this option to view the tenant name, the MDM authority, the tenant location, the account status, app installation status, and app protection policy status.
- **All apps**: Select this option to display a list of all available apps. You can add additional apps from this page. Additionally, you can see the status of each app, as well as whether each app is assigned. For more information, see [Add apps](apps-add.md) and [Assign apps](apps-deploy.md).
- **Monitor apps**
    - **App licenses**: View, assign, and monitor volume-purchased apps from the app stores. For more information, see [iOS volume-purchased program (VPP) apps](vpp-apps-ios.md) and [Microsoft Store for Business volume-purchased apps](windows-store-for-business.md).
    - **Discovered apps**: View apps that were assigned by Intune or installed on a device. For more information, see [Intune discovered apps](app-discovered-apps.md).

- **Policy**:
    - **App protection policies**: Select this option to associate settings with an app and help protect the company data it uses. For example, you might restrict the capabilities of an app to communicate with other apps, or you might require the user to enter a PIN to access a company app. For more information, see [App protection policies](app-protection-policies.md).
    - **App configuration policies**: Select this option to supply settings that might be required when a user runs an app. For more information, see [App configuration policies](app-configuration-policies-use-ios.md), [iOS app configuration policies](app-configuration-policies-use-ios.md), and [Android app configuration policies](app-configuration-policies-overview.md).
    - **iOS app provisioning profiles**: iOS apps include a provisioning profile and code that is signed by a certificate. When the certificate expires, the app can no longer be run. Intune gives you the tools to proactively assign a new provisioning profile policy to devices that have apps that are nearing expiration. For more information, see [iOS app provisioning profiles](app-provisioning-profile-ios.md).
