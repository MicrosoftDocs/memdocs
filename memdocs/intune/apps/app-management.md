# What is Microsoft Intune app management?

Microsoft Intune is a cloud-based service that protects your organization's data by using mobile device management (MDM) and mobile application management (MAM). You can use Intune to protect your organization's data at the app level (MAM) on both company devices and users' personal devices, such as smartphones, tablets, and laptops. Intune provides data protection for apps that have been enhanced to support Intune and deployed using Intune, as well as data protection for devices that have been enrolled in Intune.

The benefits of app management in Microsoft Intune include:
- **Data protection**: Intune helps protect organization (corporate) data by controlling how apps are used and ensuring that sensitive information isn't leaked or shared inappropriately.
- **Wide range of app support**: Intune supports various app types, such as store apps, web apps, and line-of-business (LOB) apps. In addition, Intune supports several platforms, such as iOS/iPadOS and Android. This app support allows organizations to manage a diverse set of applications using Intune.
- **Access control**: Intune enables organizations to manage access to organization resources, enforce compliance policies, and protect sensitive data.
- **App configuration and updates**: Intune allows organizations to manage app settings and updates, ensuring that employees are using the latest and most secure versions of their apps.
- **App management on personal devices**: You can specifically use MAM to assign, protect, and manage apps on devices that aren't enrolled with Intune.

Examples of using app management with Microsoft Intune include:
- Deploying, protecting, and managing apps for specific groups of users within your organization
- Configuring app settings, such as data sharing restrictions, to ensure compliance with corporate policies
- Implementing conditional access policies to control access to apps based on factors like device compliance, location, and user risk
- Automating app updates to keep employees up-to-date with the latest features and security patches

## Mobile Application Management (MAM) basics

[Intune mobile application management](app-lifecycle.md) refers to the suite of Intune management features that lets you publish, push, configure, secure, monitor, and update mobile apps for your users.

MAM allows you to manage and protect your organization's data within an application. Many productivity apps, such as the Microsoft 365 (Office) apps, can be managed by Intune MAM. See the official list of [Microsoft Intune protected apps](apps-supported-intune-apps.md) available for public use.

Intune MAM supports two configurations:

- **Intune MDM + MAM**: IT administrators can manage apps using MAM on devices that are enrolled with Intune mobile device management (MDM). To manage apps using MDM + MAM, customers should use Intune in the [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431).
- **Unenrolled devices with MAM managed applications**: IT administrators can manage org data and accounts in apps using MAM on unenrolled devices or devices enrolled with third-party EMM providers. To manage apps using MAM, customers should use Intune in the [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431). For more information about BYOD and Microsoft's EMS, go to the [Planning guide: Personal devices vs. Organization-owned devices](../fundamentals/intune-planning-guide.md#personal-devices-vs-organization-owned-devices).

<sup>1</sup> Consider using [Windows MAM](../apps/protect-mam-windows.md), or [Microsoft Purview Information Protection](/microsoft-365/compliance/information-protection) and [Microsoft Purview Data Loss Prevention](/microsoft-365/compliance/dlp-learn-about-dlp). Microsoft Purview simplifies the configuration set-up and provides an advanced set of capabilities. <br>
<sup>2</sup> Applies to devices managed by Intune only.<br>
<sup>3</sup> Intune supports available apps from Managed Google Play store on Android Enterprise devices.<br>
<sup>4</sup> Intune doesn't provide installing a shortcut to an app as a web link on standard Android Enterprise devices. However, Web link support is provided for [multi-app dedicated Android Enterprise devices](../configuration/device-restrictions-android-for-work.md#device-experience).<br> 
<sup>5</sup> LOB for AE are supported, but the apps need to be published privately to Managed Google Play.

## Get started

You can find most app-related information in the **Apps** workload, which you can access by doing the following:

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431).
1. Select **Apps**.

    ![The Apps workload pane](./media/app-management/apps-workload.png)

The apps workload provides links to access common app information and functionality.

The top of the App workload navigation menu provides commonly used app details:
- **Overview**: Select this option to view the tenant name, the MDM authority, the tenant location, the account status, app installation status, and app protection policy status.
- **All apps**: Select this option to display a list of all available apps. You can add additional apps from this page. Additionally, you can see the status of each app, as well as whether each app is assigned. For more information, see [Add apps](apps-add.md) and [Assign apps](apps-deploy.md).
- **Monitor**
    - **App licenses**: View, assign, and monitor volume-purchased apps from the app stores. For more information, see [iOS volume-purchased program (VPP) apps](vpp-apps-ios.md).
    - **Discovered apps**: View apps that were assigned by Intune or installed on a device. For more information, see [Intune discovered apps](app-discovered-apps.md).

- **Policy**:
    - **App protection policies**: Select this option to associate settings with an app and help protect the company data it uses. For example, you might restrict the capabilities of an app to communicate with other apps, or you might require the user to enter a PIN to access a company app. For more information, see [App protection policies](app-protection-policies.md).
    - **App configuration policies**: Select this option to supply settings that might be required when a user runs an app. For more information, see [App configuration policies](app-configuration-policies-overview.md), [iOS app configuration policies](app-configuration-policies-use-ios.md), and [Android app configuration policies](app-configuration-policies-use-android.md).
    - **iOS app provisioning profiles**: iOS apps include a provisioning profile and code that is signed by a certificate. When the certificate expires, the app can no longer be run. Intune gives you the tools to proactively assign a new provisioning profile policy to devices that have apps that are nearing expiration. For more information, see [iOS app provisioning profiles](app-provisioning-profile-ios.md).
