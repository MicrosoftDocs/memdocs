# Security Copilot in Microsoft Intune

Microsoft Security Copilot is a cloud-based AI platform that provides a natural language Copilot experience. It can help support security professionals in different scenarios, like incident response, threat hunting, and intelligence gathering. For more information about what it can do, go to [What is Microsoft Security Copilot?](/security-copilot/microsoft-security-copilot)

## Know before you begin

If you're new to Security Copilot, you should familiarize yourself with it by reading these articles:
- [What is Microsoft Security Copilot?](/security-copilot/microsoft-security-copilot)
- [Microsoft Security Copilot experiences](/security-copilot/experiences-security-copilot)
- [Get started with Microsoft Security Copilot](/security-copilot/get-started-security-copilot)
- [Understand authentication in Microsoft Security Copilot](/security-copilot/authentication)
- [Prompting in Microsoft Security Copilot](/security-copilot/prompting-security-copilot)

## Security Copilot integration in Microsoft Intune

If you use [Microsoft Intune](../fundamentals/what-is-intune.md) in the same tenant as Security Copilot, then you can use Security Copilot to get insights about your Intune data.

There are Intune capabilities built into Security Copilot, and you can use prompts to get more information, including:

- Information about your devices, apps, compliance & configuration policies, and policy assignments managed in Intune
- Managed device attributes and hardware details
- Issue with specific devices and compare a working & non-working device

This article shows you how to access your Microsoft Intune data in Security Copilot and includes sample prompts.

## Key features

There are three areas to use Copilot in Intune:

- [Policy and setting management](../copilot/copilot-intune-overview.md#policy-and-setting-management)
- [Device details and troubleshooting](../copilot/copilot-intune-overview.md#device-details-and-troubleshooting)
- [Device query](../copilot/copilot-intune-overview.md#query-with-copilot-in-device-query)

### Security admin focus

Security Copilot has a Security Operations Center (SOC) or security admin focus. So, if you're a SOC analyst or security admin, then you can use Security Copilot to get the security posture of devices that Intune manages.

For example, there's a user or device that is showing signs of malicious intent. Also, you notice some events are happening after the malicious intent, like an unknown device enrolling in Intune. Maybe someone is trying to use stolen credentials to enroll and get access. You need to get more information.

In Security Copilot, you can use the Intune capabilities to get more information, like:

- Ask about a specific device, get all the properties about that device, including the device name, device ID, and device manufacturer.
- Determine when the device is enrolled in Intune.
- Find the primary user of a device
- Determine the type of device, like a laptop or mobile phone.
- Check the compliance status, especially if a device is noncompliant, and why it's noncompliant.

In Microsoft Defender, you can use this information, including the device type, to determine your next steps. For example, you might take different actions based on the type of device (laptop vs. mobile phone vs. tablet). Security Copilot can also give you a link to the device in Microsoft Defender, so you can run any Defender actions.

### What you need to know

- When an admin submits a prompt, Copilot can only access the data that the admin has permissions to, which includes the [RBAC roles](../fundamentals/role-based-access-control.md) and [Intune scope tags](../fundamentals/scope-tags.md) assigned to them.

  If you want your admins to access all your Intune data in Security Copilot, then use the following role in Microsoft Entra ID:

  - Intune Service Administrator (also known as Intune Administrator)

  For more information on roles and authentication, go to:

  - [Roles and authentication in Microsoft Security Copilot](/security-copilot/authentication)
  - [Role based access control (RBAC) in Intune](../fundamentals/role-based-access-control.md)
  - [Use RBAC and scope tags for distributed IT in Intune](../fundamentals/scope-tags.md)

- You can access your Intune data in the [Security Copilot portal](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2247989) and Copilot in the [Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431). For more information on Copilot in Intune vs. Security Copilot, and other common questions, go to the [Microsoft Copilot in Intune FAQ](copilot-intune-faq.md).
