# Create organizational messages  

*Applies to Windows 11*  

Create, edit, and monitor [organizational messages](organizational-messages-overview.md) in the Microsoft Intune admin center. You can send important messages and call-to-actions to employees on Windows 11 devices managed by Microsoft Intune. 

This article describes how to create the following types of organizational messages: 

 * Taskbar messages  
 * Notification area messages  
 * Get Started app messages  

## Before you begin     
Complete these steps before creating a message. 

### Review overview and prerequisites   
Make sure your tenant is set up to support organizational messages.   
1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431).
2. Go to  **Tenant administration** > **Organizational messages**. 
3. Spend some time in the **Overview** tab to learn about messaging options and prerequisites. 

### Confirm license requirements  
Confirm that your tenant has the license required to support organizational messages. This step only has to be done once. You must be assigned the [Organization/Update permission](../fundamentals/create-custom-role.md#custom-role-permissions) or be a global administrator to complete this step.      
1. Go to the **Message** tab.  
2. Review licensing requirements and verify that your tenant meets the requirements. Then select **I confirm that my organization owns the appropriate license and I undestand the Windows device requirements.** 
3. Select **Confirm**.

## Step 2: Schedule a message  

# [Taskbar / Notification area](#tab/taskbar+notification) 
On the **Schedule** page, schedule the delivery of your message.  
1. Configure the delivery time window. Your options:  

   * **First day to show message**: Select when to first show the message. To ensure that delivery begins when you want it to, configure this setting 24 hours before you want the message to appear.   
   * **Last day to show message**:  Select the last day to show the message. This date must be at least 7 days after the start date.   
2. Select **Next: Assignments** to continue to assignment options.   

# [Get Started app](#tab/get-started)  
On the **Schedule** page, schedule the delivery of your message. 

1. Configure the **Message repeat frequency**. Select how often you want the message to reappear after employees dismiss it. The message will initially go away when the employee dismisses it or completes the call-to-action, but will reappear at the frequency you select here. Your options: 
   * **Once a week**
   * **Once every two weeks**
   * **Once a month**  
2. Turn on the **Always on** toggle to make messages visible in the Get Started app.  
3. Select **Next: Assignments** to continue to assignment options.

## Step 3: Add scope tags  
Optionally, add scope tags to control which administrators can see, edit, cancel, or delete messages in Intune. Choose **Select scope tags** to add scope tags to the message. Select **Remove** to delete scope tags from the message. 

For more information about scope tags, see [Use role-based access control (RBAC) and scope tags for distributed IT in Intune](../fundamentals/scope-tags.md). 

>[!NOTE]
> Intune only enforces scope tags and scope groups for messages created in Intune, and for admins with Intune roles.   

## Step 4: Assign message  
Assign the message to Microsoft Entra registered users in your organization. You can assign the message to Microsoft Entra user groups, not Microsoft Entra device groups. If a group includes both users and devices, Intune will only send the message to the users. 

1. To include groups in the assignment, you have two options:    
   * **Add groups**: Select this option to individually choose from a list of Microsoft Entra groups.  
   * **Include all users**: Select the option to assign the message to all Microsoft Entra registered users.  
2. If needed, exclude Microsoft Entra groups from the assignment. Under **Exclude**, select **Add groups** and choose the Microsoft Entra groups to leave out.  
3. Select **Next: Review + Create** to review and finalize your message.  

## Step 5: Review and create message  
Review your message, scheduling details, and assignments before creating your message. When you're ready to send the message, select **Create**. 

Return to **Organizational messages** and select the **Message** tab to view or edit your new message. 

## Edit scheduled message  
You can edit the properties of a message that's in a scheduled state. 

1. Go to **Organizational messages** > **Messages**. 
2. Select the name of the message you want to edit.  
2. A summary of the message opens, and shows the message properties. Next to **Summary**, select **Edit**.  
3. Make changes to the properties. 
4. Select **Save**.  

## Next steps  
* Monitor and track the status and user engagement details for scheduled organizational messages. For more information, see [View reporting details for organizational messages](organizational-messages-reporting.md).  
* [Cancel or delete an organizational message](organizational-messages-cancel.md) that's no longer needed. 
* For frequently asked questions, known issues, and limitations, see [Overview of organizational messages](organizational-messages-overview.md).
