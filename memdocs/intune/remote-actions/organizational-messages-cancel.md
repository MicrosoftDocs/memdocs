# Cancel or delete organizational messages      

*Applies to Windows 11*  

Cancel or delete an organizational message that you no longer need in Microsoft Intune.

## Cancel message  
Cancel an active or scheduled organizational message. Cancelling stops active messages from being sent to additional surfaces and devices. It stops scheduled messages from being sent at all.  

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431).
2. Go to **Tenant administration** > **Organizational messages**.  
2. Select the **Message** tab.  
3. Find your message in the table and scroll to the end of the row.   
3. Select the (**...**) context menu > **Cancel**.   

## Delete message  
Delete an organizational message from Microsoft Intune. Deleted messages are removed from your inventory and are no longer visible in the admin center. You can delete a message anytime, regardless of its status. This action is permanent and can't be undone.  

Intune automatically cancels active messages after you delete them, and stops the delivery of future messages. Messages that were delivered and cached prior to deletion could still appear to device users.   

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431).
2. Go to **Tenant administration** > **Organizational messages**.  
2. Select the **Message** tab.  
3. Find your message in the table and scroll to the end of the row.   
3. Select the (**...**) context menu > **Delete**.   

This action requires the *Organizational Messages/Delete* permission. Be sure to assign the permission to the custom admin roles in your tenant that need it. For more information about adding permissions to custom roles, see [Custom role permissions](../fundamentals/create-custom-role.md#custom-role-permissions).
