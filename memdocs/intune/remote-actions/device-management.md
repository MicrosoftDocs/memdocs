# Use remote actions to manage devices using Microsoft Intune

In Microsoft Intune, you can remotely run and execute commands on devices.

:::image type="content" source="./media/device-management/remote-actions-steps.png" alt-text="Diagram that shows how remote actions and commands work in Microsoft Intune." lightbox="./media/device-management/remote-actions-steps.png":::

For example:

- If a device is lost or stolen, you can reset or wipe the device.
- Your help desk can reset a password, lock the device, or collect diagnostic data.
- You can synchronize devices that haven't checked-in to Intune for a while.
- Do a quick scan or full scan of a device using Microsoft Defender Antivirus.
- And more

Use remote device actions to help you manage your devices remotely, without having to physically touch the device. This feature is available for devices that are enrolled in Intune and devices that are enrolled in other mobile device management (MDM) services.

This feature applies to:

- Android
- iOS/iPadOS
- macOS
- Windows

This article shows you how to see the available remote actions, and lists some of the common remote actions you can run on your devices.

## Prerequisites

- To run remote actions, at a minimum, sign into the [Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431) with an account that has the **Help Desk Operator** role. For more information on the different roles, go to [Role-based access control (RBAC) with Microsoft Intune](../fundamentals/role-based-access-control.md).

- To receive the remote action, the device must be connected to the internet and powered on.

## Get to your devices

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431).
2. Select **Devices**. This view shows detailed information about the individual devices, and what you can do with them, including:

    - **Overview**: Shows a visual snapshot of the enrolled devices, how many devices are using the different platforms, and more.
    - **All devices**: Shows a list of the enrolled devices you manage.

      Use the **Export** feature to create a `.zip`` list of all the devices, in increments of 10,000 (Internet Explorer) or 30,000 (Microsoft Edge, Chrome).

      Select any device to [view more details about that device](device-inventory.md), like hardware details, installed apps, policies, which remote actions are available for the device, and more.

    - **By platform**: View lists of devices by the specific platform.
    - **Enrollment**: Opens the enrollment page and lists the different enrollment options for each platform.
    - **Configuration**, **Compliance**, **Conditional access**: These options let you create new policies and view & update existing policies.
    - **Device cleanup rules**: Automatically removes inactive devices from Intune. For more information, go to [Automatically delete devices with cleanup rules](devices-wipe.md#delete-devices-from-the-intune-admin-center).
    - **Device categories**: Create [device categories](../enrollment/device-group-mapping.md) to help organize devices and build dynamic device groups.
    - **Help and Support** provides a shortcut on troubleshooting tips, requesting support, or checking the status of Intune.
