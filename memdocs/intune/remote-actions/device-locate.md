# Locate lost or stolen iOS/iPadOS devices with Intune

[!INCLUDE [azure_portal](../includes/azure_portal.md)]

To get the location of a lost or stolen iOS/iPadOS device on a map, use the **Locate device** action. The device must be in supervised mode. Before you use this action, be sure the device is in [lost mode](device-lost-mode.md).

## Supported platforms

- iOS/iPadOS 9.3 and later

This feature is not supported for the following systems: 
- Windows
- Windows Phone
- macOS
- Android

## Locate a lost or stolen device

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431).
2. Select **Devices**, and then select **All devices**.
3. From the list of devices you manage, choose an iOS/iPadOS device, and choose **...**. Then choose the **Locate device** remote action.
4. After the device is located, its location is shown in **Locate device**.

## Activate lost mode sound alert on an iOS device

If someone has lost their iOS/iPadOS 9.3 or later device, you can remotely trigger the device to play an alert sound so the user can find it. The device must be in [lost mode](device-lost-mode.md).

In the [Intune in the Azure portal](https://aka.ms/intuneportal), choose **Devices** > **All devices** > select an iOS/iPadOS device > **Overview** > **More** > **Play Lost mode sound (supervise only)**.

The sound will continue to play until the user disables the sound on the device or the device is removed from lost mode.


## Security and privacy information for lost mode and locate device actions
- No device location information is sent to Intune until you turn on this action.
- When you use the locate device action, the latitude and longitude coordinates of the device can be retrieved by using the Graph API.
- The data is stored for 24 hours, then removed. You cannot manually remove the location data.
- Location data is encrypted, both while stored and while being transmitted.
- When you configure lost mode, you can customize a message that appears on the lock screen. In this message, to help the person that finds the device, be sure to include specific details to return the lost device.

## Next steps

To see the status of enabling locate device, open **Devices**, and select **Device actions**.
