# Remotely lock devices with Intune

[!INCLUDE [azure_portal](../includes/azure_portal.md)]

The **Remote lock** device action locks the device. To unlock the device, the device owner enters their passcode. You can remotely lock devices that have a PIN or password set. Devices that don't have a PIN or password can't be remotely locked.

## Supported platforms

**Remote lock** is supported for the following platforms:

- Android
- Android enterprise kiosk devices
- Android enterprise work profile devices
- iOS
- macOS
- Windows 10 Mobile
- Windows Phone 8.1 and later

**Remote lock** isn't supported for:
- Windows 10 desktop

> [!NOTE]
> For macOS devices, you set a 6-digit recovery PIN. When the device is locked, the **Device overview** displays the PIN until another device action is sent.

## Remote lock a device

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431).
3. Select **Devices** > **All devices**.
4. In the list of devices, select a device, and then select the **Remote lock** action.

## Next steps

- To see the status of this action, select **Microsoft Intune** > **Devices** > **Device actions**. 
- For more actions that can help you manage your devices, see [Available actions](device-management.md).
