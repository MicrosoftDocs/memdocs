# Remotely restart devices with Intune


[!INCLUDE [azure_portal](../includes/azure_portal.md)]

The **Restart** device action causes the device you choose to be restarted (within 5 minutes). The device owner isn't automatically notified of the restart, and they might lose work.

## Supported platforms

- Windows - Supported on Windows 8.1 and later
    > [!Note] 
    > Windows attempts to show the user a message with the following text: "Your device administrator has scheduled a reboot." The message is shown when the 5 minute restart counter is started. Restart of Windows devices immediately requires push notifications via Windows Notification Services (WNS). 
    > For more information on WNS, see [Network Endpoint Requirements](../fundamentals/intune-endpoints.md#windows-push-notification-services-wns-dependencies).
- Android Enterprise dedicated devices - Supported on Android 8.0 and later
- Android Enterprise fully managed devices - Supported on Android 8.0 and later
- Android Enterprise corporate-owned with work profile devices - Not supported 
- Android Open Source Project (AOSP) devices - Supported 
- iOS/iPadOS - Supported

    > [!Note]  
    > This command requires a supervised device and the **Device Lock** access right. The device restarts immediately. Passcode-locked iOS/iPadOS devices don't rejoin a Wi-Fi network after restart. After restart, the device might not be able to communicate with the server.
- macOS - Supported
- Android Enterprise personally owned work profile devices - Not supported
