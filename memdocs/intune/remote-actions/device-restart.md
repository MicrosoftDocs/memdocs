# Remotely restart devices with Intune


[!INCLUDE [azure_portal](../includes/azure_portal.md)]

The **Restart** device action causes the device you choose to be restarted (within 5 minutes). The device owner isn't automatically notified of the restart, and they might lose work.

## Supported platforms

- Windows - Supported on Windows 8.1 and later
- Windows Phone - Supported on Windows Phone 8.1 and later
- Android kiosk devices - Supported on Android 7.0 and later
- iOS/iPadOS - Supported

    > [!Note]  
    > This command requires a supervised device and the **Device Lock** access right. The device restarts immediately. Passcode-locked iOS/iPadOS devices don't rejoin a Wi-Fi network after restart. After restart, the device might not be able to communicate with the server.
- macOS - Not supported
- Android and Android work profile devices - Not supported

## Restart a device

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431).
3. Select **Devices** > **All devices**.
4. In the list of devices that you manage, select a device > **Restart** > **Yes**.

## Next steps

- To see the status of the **Restart** device action, select **Devices** > **Device actions**.
