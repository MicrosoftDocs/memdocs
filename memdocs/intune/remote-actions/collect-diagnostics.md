# Collect diagnostics from an Intune managed device

The **Collect diagnostics** remote action lets you collect and download managed device logs without interrupting the user. Only nonuser locations and file types are accessed.

> [!NOTE]
>  Intune App Protection logs are available to download from the diagnostics tab in the **Troubleshooting** pane. However, M365 remote application logs are only available to their specific support engineers.
> 
> The data is stored in Microsoft support systems and isn't subject to Intune data management policies or protections. Some applications might collect and store data using systems other than Intune.

## Collect diagnostics for Microsoft 365 remote applications

The Microsoft 365 remote application diagnostics allows Intune admins to request Intune app protection logs and Microsoft 365 application logs (where applicable) directly from the Intune console. Admins can find this report in the [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431) by selecting **Troubleshooting + support** > **Troubleshoot** > *select a user* > **Summary** > *App protection**. This feature is exclusive to applications that are under Intune app protection management. If supported, the application specific logs are gathered and stored within dedicated storage solutions for each application. 

### Collect diagnostics from a M365 Application

To use the *Collect diagnostics* action:

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431)
2. Navigate to **Troubleshooting + support** > **Troubleshoot** > *select a user*.
3. On the **Summary** page, select **App Protection** >  **Checked-in**.
4. Find the application to collect diagnostics on and use the **"..."** option to select **Collect diagnostics**.
5. When prompted, select **Yes**.

To check status of the *Collect diagnostics* action:

1. On the "App Protection" summary, select **refresh**.
2. Find the application you want the status for and select the hyperlink in the Diagnostic Status column.

To download diagnostics:

1. Navigate to **Troubleshooting + support** > **Troubleshoot** > *select a user*.
2. On the **Summary** page, select the **Diagnostics** page and download the diagnostics.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For Android devices, if the Company Portal isn't signed in by the user, logs will not be available for download in the Intune portal. Diagnostic uploads exceeding 50 diagnostics or 4MB in diagnostic data cannot be downloaded directly from the Intune portal. For access to larger diagnostic uploads, reach out to [Microsoft Intune support](/mem/get-support). 

Diagnostics take approximately 30 minutes to be delivered from an end user's device. The user may be required to close and reopen the app if prompted for a pin when opening the app for the diagnostics request to prompt.

## Collect diagnostics from a Windows device

<!--1895390-->
The **Collect diagnostics** remote action can also be configured to automatically collect and upload Windows devices logs upon an Autopilot failure on a device. When an Autopilot failure occurs, logs are processed on the failed device and then automatically captured and uploaded to Intune. A device can automatically capture one set of logs per day.

The diagnostic collection is stored for 28 days and then deleted. Each device can have up to 10 collections stored at one time.

*Collect diagnostics* is also available as a [Bulk device action](../remote-actions/bulk-device-actions.md) that collects diagnostic logs from up to 25 Windows devices at a time.

> [!NOTE]
> Microsoft personnel may access device diagnostics to assist in troubleshooting and resolving incidents.

### Requirements for Windows devices

The *Collect diagnostics* remote action is supported for:

- Intune or co-managed devices
- Windows 10 version 1909 and later
- Windows 11
- Microsoft HoloLens 2 2004 and later
- Global Admins, Intune Admins, or a role with **Collect diagnostics** (under **Remote tasks**) and **Read** (under **Device compliance policies**) permissions
- Corporate-owned devices
- Devices that are online and able to communicate with the service during diagnostics

> [!NOTE]
> For diagnostics to be able to upload successfully from the client, make sure that the URL for your region is not blocked on the network:
> - `Europe - lgmsapeweu.blob.core.windows.net`
> - `Americas - lgmsapewus2.blob.core.windows.net`
> - `East Asia - lgmsapesea.blob.core.windows.net`
> - `Australia - lgmsapeaus.blob.core.windows.net`
> - `India - lgmsapeind.blob.core.windows.net`


### Collect diagnostics

To use the *Collect diagnostics* action:

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431)
2. Navigate to **Devices** > **By platform** > **Windows** > select a supported device.
3. On the device’s **Overview** page, select **…** >  **Collect diagnostics** > **Yes**. A pending notification appears on the device’s **Overview** page.
4. To see the status of the action, select **Device diagnostics monitor**.
5. After the  action completes, select **Download** in the row for the action > **Yes**.
6. The data zip file is added to your download tray and you can save it to your computer.

### Diagnostics collection on Autopilot failure
<!--1895390-->

 For Autopilot diagnostics collection, no additional action is required. Autopilot diagnostics are automatically captured when devices experience a failure as long as the Autopilot automatic capture diagnostic feature is enabled.

To view the diagnostics collected after an Autopilot failure:

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431)
2. Navigate to **Devices** > **By platform** > **Windows**.
3. Select a device.
4. Select **Diagnostics** > **Download**.
5. The data zip file is added to your download tray and you can save it to your computer.

### Data collected

<!--1895390-->
While there's no intent to collect personal data, diagnostics may include user identifiable information such as user or device name.

If you've installed [KB5011543](https://support.microsoft.com/topic/march-22-2022-kb5011543-os-builds-19042-1620-19043-1620-and-19044-1620-preview-4fe2d1c0-720f-47fe-9523-75339bc107a1) on Windows 10 or [KB5011563](https://support.microsoft.com/topic/march-28-2022-kb5011563-os-build-22000-593-preview-40df54c9-b5a9-42e5-ae1c-9a33ff91ca91) on Windows 11, the format of the zip file will be simpler including:

- A flattened structure where the logs collected are named to match the data collected
- When multiple files are collected a folder is created.  

This list below is the same order as the diagnostic zip.  Each collection contains the following data:

### Known issues with device diagnostics

Currently there are the two main issues that may cause device diagnostics to fail:

1. A timeout may occur on devices without patches [KB4601315](https://support.microsoft.com/topic/february-9-2021-kb4601315-os-build-18363-1377-bdd71d2f-6729-e22a-3150-64324e4ab954) or [KB4601319](https://support.microsoft.com/topic/february-9-2021-kb4601319-os-builds-19041-804-and-19042-804-87fc8417-4a81-0ebb-5baa-40cfab2fbfde).  These patches contain a fix to the DiagnosticLog CSP that prevents timeout during upload.  After the update installs, make sure to reboot your device.
2. The device wasn't able to receive the device action within a 24-hour window. If the device is offline or turned off, it may cause a failure.
