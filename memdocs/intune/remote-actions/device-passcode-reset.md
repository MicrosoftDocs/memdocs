# Reset or remove a device passcode in Intune

This document discusses both device level passcode reset and work profile passcode reset on Android enterprise (formerly called Android for Work, or AfW) devices. It's important to note this distinction as requirements for each can vary. A device level passcode reset resets the passcode for the entire device. A work profile passcode reset resets the passcode only for the user's work profile on Android enterprise devices.

## Supported platforms for device level passcode reset

| Platform | Supported? |
| ---- | ---- |
| Android devices on version 6.x or earlier | Yes |
| Android Enterprise devices enrolled as Device Owner | Yes |
| iOS/iPadOS devices | Yes |
| iOS/iPadOS devices enrolled with User Enrollment | No |
| Android Enterprise personally-owned/corporate-owned devices enrolled with a work profile | No |
| Android devices on version 7.0 or later | No |
| macOS | No |
| Windows | No |
| Android Open Source Project (AOSP) Corporate-owned, user-associated devices | Yes |
| Android Open Source Project (AOSP) Corporate-owned, userless devices | Yes |

For Android devices, device level passcode reset is only supported on devices running 6.x or earlier, or on Android enterprise devices running in Kiosk mode. This restriction is because Google removed support for resetting an Android 7 device's passcode/password from within a Device Administrator granted app and applies to all MDM vendors.

## Supported platforms for Android enterprise work profile passcode reset

| Platform | Supported? |
| ---- | ---- |
| Android enterprise devices enrolled with a work profile and running version 8.0 and later | Yes |
| Android enterprise corporate-owned devices with a work profile | Yes |
| Android enterprise devices enrolled with a work profile and running version 7.x and earlier | No |
| Android devices running version 7.x and earlier | No |

To create a new work profile passcode, use the Reset Passcode action. This action prompts a passcode reset and creates a new, temporary passcode for the work profile only.

## Reset a passcode

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431) with any of the following roles: Microsoft Entra Global Admin, Microsoft Entra Intune Service Admin (also known as Intune Administrator), Helpdesk Operator, or Role Administrator.
2. Select **Devices**, and then select **All devices**.
3. From the list of devices you manage, select a device, and choose **Reset passcode**.

> [!NOTE]
> To successfully reset a passcode for the Work Profile of an Android device you must configure the device passcode within device restrictions. Any attempts to reset the passcode without configuration will fail.


## Reset Android work profile and Device Owner passcodes

Supported Android Enterprise personally-owned and corporate-owned work profile devices enrolled with a work profile receive a new managed profile unlock password or a managed profile challenge for the end user.

For Android Enterprise personally-owned work profile devices running version 8.x or later, end users get notified to activate their reset passcode right after enrollment completes. The notification is displayed if a work profile password is required and set. After their passcode is entered, the notification is dismissed.

After the reset passcode is selected from the admin center, a temporary passcode is presented to the admin. This passcode is provided for the following devices when running version 8.x or later:

- Android Enterprise device owner
- Android Enterprise personally-owned work profile
- Android Enterprise corporate-owned work profile

The temporary passcode must be entered on the device. The temporary passcode for the device will be displayed in the admin center for seven days.

## Remove iOS/iPadOS passcodes

Instead of being reset, passcodes are removed from iOS/iPadOS devices. If there's a passcode compliance policy set, the device will prompt the user to set a new passcode in Settings.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If the Remove passcode action failed, it's possible that the wrong unlock token is stored in Intune and the device will need to be wiped in order to regain access to it. 

## Troubleshooting remote lock failures

If the remote lock action failed, validate that the following have been correctly configured:

- If the remote lock action failed on an Android (AOSP) device, confirm that you have a device passcode policy assigned to the device. If the device does not have a device passcode assigned, the remote lock action will not succeed.

## Next steps

To see the status of the action you just took, in **Devices**, select **Device actions**.
