# Use Fresh Start to reset Windows 10 and 11 devices with Intune

The **Fresh Start** device action removes any apps that are installed on a PC running Windows 10, version 1709 or later and Windows 11. Fresh Start helps remove pre-installed (OEM) apps that are typically installed with a new PC.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431) and select **Devices** > **All devices**.
2. From the list of devices you manage, choose a Windows 10 desktop device.
3. Click **Fresh Start**.
4. Select **Retain user data on this device** to:
   * Keep the device Microsoft Entra joined
   * Device is enrolled into mobile device management again when a Microsoft Entra ID enabled user signs into the device.
   * Keep the contents of the device user's Home folder, and remove apps and settings

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > If you do not retain user data, the device will be restored to the default OOBE (out-of-box experience) completed state retaining the built in administrator account.
   > BYOD devices will be unenrolled from Microsoft Entra ID and mobile device management.
   > Microsoft Entra joined devices will be enrolled into mobile device management again when a Microsoft Entra ID enabled user signs into the device.

5. Click **OK**.
6. To see the status of this action, go back to **Devices** and click **Device actions**.  
7. The device will be restored to the initial sign-in screen.
