# Remove apps and configurations from devices

**Remove apps and configuration** is a single device action used to uninstall applications or remove a configuration item from a device. With this new device action, Intune can temporarily remove applications and configuration from a single device. When ready, you can initiate a **Restore** action to return the removed item to the device. Removed items are automatically restored to devices in 8-24 hours in cases where an admin does not initiate a **Restore** action to ensure that devices remain consistent with assignment intents.  

This action aims to resolve the issues that customers face outside of Intune and swiftly bring back end-user efficiency.
