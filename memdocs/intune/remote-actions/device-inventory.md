# See device details in Intune

The **Devices** feature provides more details about the devices you manage, including their hardware and the apps installed.

This article shows you how to view all your devices, and their properties in the Microsoft Intune admin center.

## View the device details

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431).
2. Select **Devices** > **All devices** > select one of your listed devices to open its details:

   - **Overview** shows the device name, and lists some key properties of the device, like whether it's a personal or corporate device, serial number, primary user, and more. You can perform the following actions on the device (depending on the device platform):
      - [Retire](devices-wipe.md#retire)
      - [Wipe](devices-wipe.md#wipe)
      - [Delete](devices-wipe.md#delete-devices-from-the-intune-admin-center)

      - [Rename device](device-rename.md)
      - [New Remote Assistance Session](./teamviewer-support.md)
   - Use **Properties** to assign a [device category you create](../enrollment/device-group-mapping.md), and change ownership of the device to a personal device, or a corporate device.
   - **Hardware** includes many details about the device, like the device ID, operating system and version, storage space, and more details.
   - **Discovered apps** lists all the apps that Intune found installed on the device, and the app versions. For more information, see [Intune discovered apps](../apps/app-discovered-apps.md).
   - **Device compliance** lists all assigned compliance policies, and if the device is compliant or not compliant.
   - **Device configuration** shows all device configuration policies assigned to the device, and if the policy succeeded or failed.
   - **App configuration**
   - **Recovery keys** shows available BitLocker keys found for the device
   - **Managed apps** lists all the managed apps that Intune configured and has deployed to the device.

 > [!NOTE]
 > 
 > - For Windows 10 devices that are registered with [Windows Autopilot service](/autopilot/add-devices), Enrolled date displays the time when devices were registered with Autopilot instead of the time when they were enrolled.
 > - For Android Enterprise corporate-owned work profile devices, reporting for phone number is not supported. For Android Enterprise fully managed and dedicated devices, reporting for phone number is supported; however, certain SIM cards will not write the data and therefore the phone number won't get reported in those cases.
 > - For multi-SIM iOS/iPadOS devices, Intune has no control over which SIM data is assigned to the Service Subscription slots on the device for the ICCID, IMEI, MEID, and Phone number values. Intune only reports the first available values received from the device in the following order:
   > - CT Subscription Slot One
     > - CT Subscription Slot Two
       >  - Top-level ICCID, IMEI, MEID, and Phone number properties (deprecated)
