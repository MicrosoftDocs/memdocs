   - **Overview** shows the device name, and lists some key properties of the device, like whether it's a personal or corporate device, serial number, primary user, and more. You can do the following on the device:

      - [New Remote Assistance Session](https://docs.microsoft.com/mem/intune/remote-actions/teamviewer-support)
   - Use **Properties** to assign a [device category you create](../enrollment/device-group-mapping.md), and change ownership of the device to a personal device, or a corporate device.
   - **Hardware** includes many details about the device, like the device ID, operating system and version, storage space, and more details.
   - **Discovered apps** lists all the apps that Intune found installed on the device, and the app versions. For more information, see [Intune discovered apps](../apps/app-discovered-apps.md).
