# Remotely shut down devices using Intune

With the **Shut down** device action you can remotely power off devices. When you remotely shut down the device, no warning will be given to the end user.

## Supported platforms

 - iOS/iPadOS 10.3 and later
 - macOS 10.13 and later

> [!NOTE]
> This command requires a supervised iOS/iPadOS device and the device shuts down immediately.  Supervision is not required for macOS devices. iOS/iPadOS devices that are Passcode-locked will not rejoin a Wi-Fi network after restarting. After restarting, the device might not be able to communicate with the server.

## Shut down an iOS/iPadOS device

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431).
2. Select **Devices** > **All devices**.
3. In the list of devices that you manage, select a device > **Shut down (supervised only)** > **Yes**.
