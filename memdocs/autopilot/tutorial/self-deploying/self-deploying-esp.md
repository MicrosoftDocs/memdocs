# Self-deploying mode: Configure and assign the Enrollment Status Page (ESP)

Autopilot self-deploying mode steps:
- Step 1: [Set up Windows automatic Intune enrollment](self-deploying-automatic-enrollment.md)
- Step 2: [Register devices as Autopilot devices](self-deploying-register-device.md)
- Step 3: [Create a device group](self-deploying-device-group.md)
> [!div class="checklist"]
> **Step 4: Configure and assign Autopilot Enrollment Status Page (ESP)**
- Step 5: [Create and assign Autopilot profile](self-deploying-autopilot-profile.md)

For an overview of the Windows Autopilot self-deploying mode workflow, see [Windows Autopilot self-deploying overview](self-deploying-workflow.md)

> [!NOTE]
>
> If you've already configured and assigned an ESP from another Autopilot scenario and want to keep the same settings for the ESP for the self-deploying mode scenario, you can skip this step and move on to [Step 5: Create and assign Autopilot profile](self-deploying-autopilot-profile.md).
