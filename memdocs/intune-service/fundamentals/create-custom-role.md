# Create a custom role in Intune

You can create a custom Intune role that includes any permissions required for a specific job function. For example, if an IT department group manages applications, policies, and configuration profiles, you can add all those permissions together in one custom role. After creating a custom role, you can [assign](assign-role.md) it to any users that need those permissions.

To create, edit, or assign roles, your account must have one of the following permissions in Microsoft Entra ID.

- Global Administrator
- Intune Service Administrator

For more information, see [Role-based access control (RBAC) with Microsoft Intune](role-based-access-control.md).

## To create a custom role

1. In the [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431), choose **Tenant administration** > **Roles** > **All roles** > **Create**.

2. On the **Basics** page, enter a name and description for the new role, then choose **Next**.

3. On the **Permissions** page, choose the permissions you want to use with this role.

4. On the **Scope (Tags)** page, choose the tags for this role. When this role is assigned to a user, that user can access resources that also have these tags. Choose **Next**.

5. On the **Review + create** page, when you're done, choose **Create**. The new role is displayed in the list on the **Intune roles - All roles** page.

## Copy a role

You can also copy an existing role.

1. In the [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431), choose **Tenant administration** > **Roles** > **All roles** > select the checkbox for a role in the list > **Duplicate**.

2. On the **Basics** page, enter a name. Make sure to use a unique name.

3. All the permissions and scope tags from the original role are already selected. You can later change the duplicate role's **Name**, **Description**, **Permissions**, and **Scope (Tags)**.

4. After you make all the changes that you want, choose **Next** to get to the **Review + create** page. Select **Create**.

## Custom role permissions

> [!NOTE]
> You can view and manage VPP apps with only the **Mobile apps** permission assigned. Previously, the **Managed apps** permission was required to view and manage VPP apps. This change doesn't apply to Intune for Education tenants who still need to assign the **Managed apps** permission.

The following permissions are available when creating custom roles.
