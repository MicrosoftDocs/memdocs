# Android app protection policy settings in Microsoft Intune
This article describes the app protection policy settings for Android devices. The policy settings that are described can be [configured](app-protection-policies.md) for an app protection policy on the **Settings** pane in the portal.
There are three categories of policy settings: data protection settings, access requirements, and conditional launch. In this article, the term *policy-managed apps* refers to apps that are configured with app protection policies.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Intune Company Portal is required on the device to receive App Protection Policies for Android devices.
>
> The Intune Managed Browser has been retired. Use [Microsoft Edge](../apps/manage-microsoft-edge.md) for your protected Intune browser experience. 

## Data protection

### Encryption
|Setting |How to use |Default value |
|:------|:------|:------|
|**Encrypt org data** |Choose **Require** to enable encryption of work or school data in this app. Intune uses a wolfSSL, 256-bit AES encryption scheme along with the Android Keystore system to securely encrypt app data. Data is encrypted synchronously during file I/O tasks. Content on the device storage is always encrypted and can only be opened by apps that support Intune's app protection policies and have policy assigned. New files will be encrypted with 256-bit keys. Existing 128-bit encrypted files will undergo a migration attempt to 256-bit keys, but the process isn't guaranteed. Files encrypted with 128-bit keys will remain readable. <br><br> The encryption method is FIPS 140-2 validated; for more information, see [wolfCrypt FIPS 140-2 and FIPS 140-3](https://www.wolfssl.com/license/fips/). |**Require**|
|<ul><b>**Encrypt org data on enrolled devices** |Select **Require** to enforce encrypting org data with Intune app layer encryption on all devices. Select **Not required** to not enforce encrypting org data with Intune app layer encryption on enrolled devices.|**Require** |


### Functionality
|Setting |How to use |Default value |
|:------|:------|:------|
|  **Sync policy managed app data with native apps or add-ins** | Choose Block to prevent policy managed apps from saving data to the device's native apps (Contacts, Calendar and widgets) and to prevent the use of add-ins within the policy managed apps. If not supported by the application, saving data to native apps and using add-ins will be allowed.  <br><br>If you choose Allow, the policy managed app can save data to the native apps or use add-ins, if those features are supported and enabled within the policy managed app.<br><br>Applications may provide additional controls to customize the data sync behavior to specific native apps or not honor this control. <br><br>**Note**: When you perform a selective wipe to remove work, or school data from the app, data synced directly from the policy managed app to the native app is removed. Any data synced from the native app to another external source won't be wiped. <br><br>**Note**: *The following apps support this feature: <ul><li>Outlook for Android see [Deploying Outlook for iOS and Android app configuration settings](/exchange/clients-and-mobile-in-exchange-online/outlook-for-ios-and-android/outlook-for-ios-and-android-configuration-with-microsoft-intune)</li>*</ul>   |**Allow** |
|**Printing Org data** |Choose **Block** to prevent the app from printing work or school data. If you leave this setting to **Allow**, the default value, users will be able to export and print all Org data. |**Allow** |
|**Restrict web content transfer with other apps** |Specify how web content (http/https links) is opened from policy-managed applications. Choose from: <ul><li>**Any app**: Allow web links in any app.</li><li>**Intune Managed Browser**: Allow web content to open only in the Intune Managed Browser. This browser is a policy-managed browser.</li><li>**Microsoft Edge**: Allow web content to open only in the Microsoft Edge.

## Access requirements

|Setting |How to use |
|:------ |:------|
|**PIN for access** |Select **Require** to require a PIN to use this app. The user is prompted to set up this PIN the first time they run the app in a work or school context. <br><br> Default value = **Require**<br><br> You can configure the PIN strength using the settings available under the PIN for access section.<br><br> **Note:** End-users that are allowed to access the app can reset the app PIN. This setting may not be visible in some cases on Android devices. Android devices have a maximum limitation of four available shortcuts. When the maximum has been reached, the end user must remove any personalized shortcuts (or access the shortcut from a different managed app view) to view the reset APP PIN shortcut. Alternatively, the end user could pin the shortcut to their homepage.
|<ol><br>**PIN type** |Set a requirement for either numeric or passcode type PINs before accessing an app that has app protection policies applied. Numeric requirements involve only numbers, while a passcode can be defined with at least 1 alphabetical letter **or** at least 1 special character. <br><br> Default value = **Numeric**<br><br> **Note:** Special characters allowed include the special characters and symbols on the Android English language keyboard.  |
|<ul><b> **Simple PIN** |Select **Allow** to allow users to use simple PIN sequences like *1234*, *1111*, *abcd* or *aaaa*. Select **Blocks** to prevent them from using simple sequences. Simple sequences are checked in 3 character sliding windows. If **Block** is configured, 1235 or 1112 wouldn't be accepted as PIN set by the end user, but 1122 would be allowed. <br><br>Default value = **Allow** <br><br>**Note:** If Passcode type PIN is configured, and Simple PIN is set to Allow, the user needs at least one letter **or** at least one special character in their PIN. If Passcode type PIN is configured, and Simple PIN is set to Block, the user needs at least one number **and** one letter **and** at least one special character in their PIN. </li> |
|<ul><b> **Select minimum PIN length** |Specify the minimum number of digits in a PIN sequence. <br><br>Default value = **4** |
|<ul><b>**Biometrics instead of PIN for access** |Select **Allow** to allow the user to use biometrics to authenticate users on Android devices. If allowed, biometrics is used to access the app on Android 10 or higher devices.    |
|<ul><b>**Override biometric with PIN after timeout** |To use this setting, select **Require** and then configure an inactivity timeout. <br><br>Default value = **Require** |
|<ul><b><ul><b> **Timeout (minutes of inactivity)** |Specify a time in minutes after which either a passcode or numeric (as configured) PIN will override the use of a biometric. This timeout value should be greater than the value specified under 'Recheck the access requirements after (minutes of inactivity)'.<br><br>Default value = **30** |
|<ul><b> **Class 3 biometrics (Android 9.0+)** | Select **Require** to require the user to sign in with class 3 biometrics. For more information on class 3 biometrics, see [Biometrics](https://source.android.com/docs/security/biometric) in Google's documentation.  |
|<ul><b> **Override biometrics with PIN after biometric updates** | Select **Require** to override the use of biometrics with PIN when a change in biometrics is detected.<p><p>**NOTE:**<br>This setting only takes effect once a biometric has been used to access the app. Depending on the Android device manufacturer, not all forms of biometrics may be supported for cryptographic operations. Currently, cryptographic operations are supported for any biometric (e.g., fingerprint, iris, or face) on the device that meets or exceeds the requirements for Class 3 biometrics, as defined in the Android documentation. See the `BIOMETRIC_STRONG` constant of the [BiometricManager.Authenticators](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/biometrics/BiometricManager.Authenticators#BIOMETRIC_STRONG) interface and the `authenticate` method of the [BiometricPrompt](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/biometrics/BiometricPrompt#authenticate(android.hardware.biometrics.BiometricPrompt.CryptoObject,%20android.os.CancellationSignal,%20java.util.concurrent.Executor,%20android.hardware.biometrics.BiometricPrompt.AuthenticationCallback)) class. You may need to contact your device manufacturer to understand the device-specific limitations.  |
|<ul><b>**PIN reset after number of days** |Select **Yes** to require users to change their app PIN after a set period of time, in days.  <br><br>When set to *Yes*, you then configure the number of days before the PIN reset is required. <br><br> Default value = **No**  |
|<ul><b><ul><b> **Number of days** |Configure the number of days before the PIN reset is required. <br><br> Default value = **90**  |
|<ul><b>**Select number of previous PIN values to maintain** |This setting specifies the number of previous PINs that Intune will maintain. Any new PINs must be different from those that Intune is maintaining. <br><br> Default value = **0** |
|<ul><b>**App PIN when device PIN is set** |Select **Not required** to disable the app PIN when a device lock is detected on an enrolled device with Company Portal configured. <br><br> Default value = **Require**. |
|**Work or school account credentials for access** |Choose **Require** to require the user to sign in with their work or school account instead of entering a PIN for app access. When set to **Require**, and PIN or biometric prompts are turned on, both corporate credentials and either the PIN or biometric prompts are shown. <br><br>Default value = **Not required** |
|**Recheck the access requirements after (minutes of inactivity)** |Configure the following setting: <ul><li>**Timeout**: This is the number of minutes before the access requirements (defined earlier in the policy) are rechecked. For example, an admin turns on PIN and Blocks rooted devices in the policy, a user opens an Intune-managed app, must enter a PIN, and must be using the app on a non-rooted device. When using this setting, the user won't have to enter a PIN or undergo another root-detection check on any Intune-managed app for a period of time equal to the configured value.  <br><br>This policy setting format supports a positive whole number. <br><br> Default value = **30 minutes** <br><br> **Note:** On Android, the PIN is shared with all Intune-managed apps. The PIN timer is reset once the app leaves the foreground on the device. The user won't have to enter a PIN on any Intune-managed app that shares its PIN for the duration of the timeout defined in this setting. <br><br></li> |

> [!NOTE]  
> To learn more about how multiple Intune app protection settings configured in the Access section to the same set of apps and users work on Android, see [Intune MAM frequently asked questions](mam-faq.yml) and [Selectively wipe data using app protection policy access actions in Intune](app-protection-policies-access-actions.md).

## Conditional launch
Configure conditional launch settings to set sign-in security requirements for your app protection policy. 

By default, several settings are provided with pre-configured values and actions. You can delete some settings, like the *Min OS version*. You can also select additional settings from the **Select one** dropdown. 

### App conditions

|Setting |How to use |
|:----|:-----|
|**Max PIN attempts** |Specify the number of tries the user has to successfully enter their PIN before the configured action is taken. If the user fails to successfully enter their PIN after the maximum PIN attempts, the user must reset their pin after successfully logging into their account and completing a Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) challenge if required. This policy setting format supports a positive whole number.<p>*Actions* include: <br><ul><li>**Reset PIN** - The user must reset their PIN.</li><li>**Wipe data** - The user account that is associated with the application is wiped from the device.</li></ul>Default value = **5** |
|**Offline grace period** |The number of minutes that managed apps can run offline. Specify the time (in minutes) before the access requirements for the app are rechecked.<p>*Actions* include: <br><ul><li>**Block access (minutes)** - The number of minutes that managed apps can run offline. Specify the time (in minutes) before the access requirements for the app are rechecked. After this period expires, the app requires user authentication to Microsoft Entra ID so that the app can continue to run. <br><br>This policy setting format supports a positive whole number. <br><br>Default value = **1440** minutes (24 hours) <br><br><b>Note:</b> Configuring the Offline grace period timer for blocking access to be less than the default value may result in more frequent user interruptions as policy is refreshed. Choosing a value of less than 30 mins isn't recommended as it may result in user interruptions at each application launch or resume.</li><li>**Wipe data (days)** - After this many days (defined by the admin) of running offline, the app will require the user to connect to the network and reauthenticate. If the user successfully authenticates, they can continue to access their data and the offline interval will reset.  If the user fails to authenticate, the app will perform a selective wipe of the user's account and data. For more information, see [How to wipe only corporate data from Intune-managed apps](apps-selective-wipe.md). This policy setting format supports a positive whole number. <br><br> Default value = **90 days** </li></ul> This entry can appear multiple times, with each instance supporting a different action. |
|**Min app version** |Specify a value for the minimum application version value.<p>*Actions* include: <br><ul><li>**Warn** - The user sees a notification if the app version on the device doesn't meet the requirement. This notification can be dismissed.</li><li>**Block access** - The user is blocked from access if the app version on the device doesn't meet the requirement. </li><li>**Wipe data** - The user account that is associated with the application is wiped from the device. </li></ul> </li></ul> As apps often have distinct versioning schemes between them, create a policy with one minimum app version targeting one app (for example, *Outlook version policy*).<br><br> This entry can appear multiple times, with each instance supporting a different action.<br><br> This policy setting format supports either major.minor, major.minor.build, major.minor.build.revision.<br><br> Additionally, you can configure **where** your end users can get an updated version of a line-of-business (LOB) app. End users will see this in the **min app version** conditional launch dialog, which will prompt end users to update to a minimum version of the LOB app. On Android, this feature uses the Company Portal. To configure where an end user should update a LOB app, the app needs a managed [app configuration policy](app-configuration-policies-managed-app.md) sent to it with the key, `com.microsoft.intune.myappstore`. The value sent will define which store the end user will download the app from. If the app is deployed via the Company Portal, the value must be `CompanyPortal`. For any other store, you must enter a complete URL. |
|**Disabled account** |There's no value to set for this setting.<p>*Actions* include: <br><ul><li>**Block access** - The user is blocked from access because their account has been disabled.</li><li>**Wipe data** - The user account that is associated with the application is wiped from the device.</li></ul> |
|**Non-working time** |There's no value to set for this setting.<p>*Actions* include: <br><ul><li>**Block access** - The user is blocked from access because the user account that is associated with the application is in non-working time.</li><li>**Warn** - The user sees a notification if the user account that is associated with the application is in non-working time.

|**Device manufacturer(s)** |Specify a semicolon separated list of manufacturer(s). These values aren't case sensitive. *Actions* include: <br><ul><li>**Allow specified (Block non-specified)** - Only devices that match the specified manufacturer can use the app. All other devices are blocked. </li></ul> <ul><li>**Allow specified (Wipe non-specified)** - The user account that is associated with the application is wiped from the device. </li></ul> For more information on using this setting, see [Conditional Launch actions](app-protection-policies-access-actions.md#android-policy-settings). |
|**Play integrity verdict** |App protection policies support some of Google Play Integrity APIs. This setting in particular configures [Google's Play Integrity](https://developer.android.com/google/play/integrity) check on end user devices to validate the integrity of those devices. Specify either **Basic integrity** or **Basic integrity and device integrity**. <p>**Basic integrity** tells you about the general integrity of the device. Rooted devices, emulators, virtual devices, and devices with signs of tampering fail basic integrity. **Basic integrity & certified devices** tells you about the compatibility of the device with Google's services. Only unmodified devices that have been certified by Google can pass this check.<p>If you select **Play integrity verdict** as required for conditional launch, you can specify that a strong integrity check is used as the evaluation type. The presence of a strong integrity check as the evaluation type will indicate greater integrity of a device. Devices that don't support strong integrity checks will be blocked by the MAM policy if they're targeted with this setting. The strong integrity check provides a more robust root detection in response to newer types of rooting tools and methods that can't always be reliably detected by a software only solution. Within APP, hardware attestation will be enabled by setting **Play integrity verdict evaluation type** to **Check strong integrity** once **Play integrity verdict** is configured, and **Required SafetyNet evaluation type** to **strong integrity check** once **Device integrity check** is configured. Hardware backed attestation leverages a hardware-based component which shipped with devices installed with Android 8.1 and later. Devices that were upgraded from an older version of Android to Android 8.1 are unlikely to have the hardware-based components necessary for hardware backed attestation. While this setting should be widely supported starting with devices that shipped with Android 8.1, Microsoft strongly recommends testing devices individually before enabling this policy setting broadly.<p>**Important:** Devices that don't support this evaluation type will be blocked or wiped based on the Device integrity check action. Organizations that would like to use this functionality will need to ensure users have supported devices. For more information on Google’s recommended devices, see [Android Enterprise Recommended requirements](https://www.android.com/enterprise/recommended/requirements/).<p>*Actions* include: <br><ul><li>**Warn** - The user sees a notification if the device doesn't meet Google's device integrity check based on the value configured. This notification can be dismissed. </li></ul><ul><li>**Block access** - The user is blocked from access if the device doesn't meet Google's device integrity check based on the value configured. </li></ul> <ul><li>**Wipe data** - The user account that is associated with the application is wiped from the device. </li></ul> </li></ul> For commonly asked questions related to this setting, see [Frequently asked questions about MAM and app protection](mam-faq.yml). |
|**Require threat scan on apps** |App protection policies support some of Google Play Protect's APIs. This setting in particular ensures that Google's Verify Apps scan is turned on for end user devices. If configured, the end user will be blocked from access until they turn on Google's app scanning on their Android device. *Actions* include: <br><ul><li>**Warn** - The user sees a notification if Google's Verify Apps scan on the device isn't turned on. This notification can be dismissed. </li></ul><ul><li>**Block access** - The user is blocked from access if Google's Verify Apps scan on the device isn't turned on. </li></ul></li></ul> Results from Google's Verify Apps scan are surfaced in the **Potentially Harmful Apps** report in the console. |
|**Required SafetyNet evaluation type** | Hardware backed attestation enhances the existing SafetyNet attestation service check. You can set the value to **Hardware-backed key** after setting **SafteyNet device attestation**. |
|**Require device lock** |This setting determines whether the Android device has a device PIN that meets the minimum password requirement. The App protection policy can take action if the device lock doesn’t meet the minimum password requirement.<p><p>**Values** include:<br><ul><li>**Low Complexity**</li><li>**Medium Complexity**</li><li>**High Complexity**</li></ul><p>This complexity value is targeted to Android 12+. For devices operating on Android 11 and earlier, setting a complexity value of low, medium, or high will default to the expected behavior for **Low Complexity**. For more information, see Google's developer documentation [getPasswordComplexity](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/admin/DevicePolicyManager#getPasswordComplexity%28%29), [PASSWORD_COMPLEXITY_LOW](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/admin/DevicePolicyManager#PASSWORD_COMPLEXITY_LOW), [PASSWORD_COMPLEXITY_MEDIUM](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/admin/DevicePolicyManager#PASSWORD_COMPLEXITY_MEDIUM), and [PASSWORD_COMPLEXITY_HIGH](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/admin/DevicePolicyManager#PASSWORD_COMPLEXITY_HIGH).<p>**Actions** include:<br><ul><li>**Warn** - The user sees a notification if the device lock doesn’t meet the minimum password requirement. The notification can be dismissed.</li><li>**Block access** - The user will be blocked from access if the device lock doesn’t meet the minimum password requirement.</li></ul><ul><li>**Wipe data** - The user account that is associated with the application is wiped from the device if the device lock doesn’t meet the minimum password requirement.</li></ul> |
|**Min Company Portal version** |By using the **Min Company Portal version**, you can specify a specific minimum defined version of the Company Portal that is enforced on an end user device. This conditional launch setting allows you to set values to **Block access**, **Wipe data**, and **Warn** as possible actions when each value isn't met. The possible formats for this value follow the pattern *[Major].[Minor]*, *[Major].[Minor].[Build]*, or *[Major].[Minor].[Build].[Revision]*. Given that some end users may not prefer a forced update of apps on the spot, the 'warn' option may be ideal when configuring this setting. The Google Play Store does a good job of only sending the delta bytes for app updates, but this can still be a large amount of data that the user may not want to utilize if they are on data at the time of the update. Forcing an update and thereby downloading an updated app could result in unexpected data charges at the time of the update. For more information, see [Android policy settings](app-protection-policies-access-actions.md#android-policy-settings). |
|**Max Company Portal version age (days)** |You can set a maximum number of days as the age of the Company Portal (CP) version for Android devices. This setting ensures that end users are within a certain range of CP releases (in days). The value must be between 0 and 365 days. When the setting for the devices isn't met, the action for this setting is triggered. Actions include **Block access**, **Wipe data**, or **Warn**. For related information, see [Android policy settings](app-protection-policies-access-actions.md#android-policy-settings). **Note:** The age of the Company Portal build is determined by [Google Play](https://developer.android.com/reference/com/google/android/play/core/appupdate/AppUpdateInfo#clientVersionStalenessDays) on the end user device. |
|**Samsung Knox device attestation** | Specify if the Samsung Knox device attestation check is required. Only unmodified devices that have been verified by Samsung can pass this check. For the list of supported devices, see [samsungknox.com](https://www.samsungknox.com/en/knox-platform/supported-devices/knox-device-attestation).<br><br>By using this setting, Microsoft Intune will also verify communication from the Company Portal to the Intune Service was sent from a healthy device. <br><br>*Actions* include: <br><ul><li>**Warn** - The user sees a notification if the device doesn't meet Samsung Knox device attestation check. This notification can be dismissed.</li><li>**Block access** - The user account is blocked from access if the device doesn't meet Samsung's Knox device attestation check.</li><li>**Wipe data** - The user account that is associated with the application is wiped from the device.</li></ul><p>**Note:** The user must accept the Samsung Knox terms before the device attestation check can be performed.  If the user doesn't accept the Samsung Knox terms, the specified action will occur.<p>**Note:** This setting will apply to all devices targeted.  To apply this setting only to Samsung devices, you can use "Managed apps" assignment filters.  For more information on assignment filters, see [Use filters when assigning your apps, policies, and profiles in Microsoft Intune](../fundamentals/filters.md).|
|**Max allowed device threat level** |App protection policies can take advantage of the Intune-MTD connector. Specify a maximum threat level acceptable to use this app. Threats are determined by your chosen Mobile Threat Defense (MTD) vendor app on the end user device. Specify either *Secured*, *Low*, *Medium*, or *High*. *Secured* requires no threats on the device and is the most restrictive configurable value, while *High* essentially requires an active Intune-to-MTD connection.<p>*Actions* include: <br><ul><li>**Block access** - The user will be blocked from access if the threat level determined by your chosen Mobile Threat Defense (MTD) vendor app on the end user device doesn't meet this requirement.</li><li>**Wipe data** - The user account that is associated with the application is wiped from the device.</li></ul>For more information on using this setting, see [Enable the Mobile Threat Defense connector in Intune for unenrolled devices](../protect/mtd-enable-unenrolled-devices.md).</li></ul> |
|**Primary MTD service** |If you have configured multiple Intune-MTD connectors, specify the primary MTD vendor app that should be used on the end user device.<p><p>**Values** include:<br><ul><li>**Microsoft Defender for Endpoint** - if the MTD connector is configured, specify Microsoft Defender for Endpoint will provide the device threat level information.</li><li>**Mobile Threat Defense (Non-Microsoft)** - if the MTD connector is configured, specify the non-Microsoft MTD will provide the device threat level information.</li></ul><p>You must configure the setting “Max allowed device threat level” to use this setting. <p> There are no **Actions** for this setting.|
