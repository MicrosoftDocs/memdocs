# Quick Start Guide for Lite Touch Installation

Microsoft Deployment Toolkit (MDT) 2013 provides technology for deploying Windows operating systems, and Microsoft Office. This guide helps you quickly evaluate MDT 2013 by providing condensed, step-by-step instructions for using it to install the Windows 8.1 operating system through Lite Touch Installation (LTI) using bootable media (DVD or USB flash drive). This guide demonstrates how to perform the New Computer deployment scenario using an MDT 2013 deployment share. The New Computer deployment scenario covers the deployment of Windows 8.1 to a new computer. This scenario assumes that there is no user data or profile to preserve.

> [!NOTE]
>
> In this document, *Windows* applies to the Windows 8.1, Windows 8, Windows 7, Windows Server® 2012 R2, Windows Server 2012, and Windows Server 2008 R2 operating systems unless otherwise noted. MDT does not support ARM processor-based versions of Windows. Similarly, *MDT* refers to MDT 2013 unless otherwise stated.

 After using this guide to evaluate MDT, review the rest of the MDT guidance to learn more about the technology's advanced features.

## Prerequisites

To deploy operating systems and applications using MDT, the environment must meet the following software and computer configuration prerequisites.

### Required Software

To complete this guide, the following software is required:

- Windows 8.1

   If you decide to complete this guide on an operating system other than Windows 8.1, MDT requires the following elements:

  - Microsoft .NET Framework version 3.5 with Service Pack 1

  - Windows PowerShell™ version 2.0

    Windows 8.1 includes these features.

- Windows Assessment and Deployment Kit (Windows ADK) for Windows 8.1

- Networking services, including Domain Name System and Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol

> [!NOTE]
>
> The Task Sequencer used in MDT deployments requires that the Create Global Object right be assigned to credentials used to access and run the Deployment Workbench and the deployment process. This right is normally available to accounts with Administrator-level permissions (unless explicitly removed). Also, the Specialized Security - Limited Functionality (SSLF) security profile removes the Create Global Object right and should not be applied to computers being deployed using MDT until the MDT process is complete.

### Computer Configuration

To complete this guide, set up the computers listed in the following table. These computers can be either physical computers or virtual machines (VMs) with the system resources designated.

|**Computer name**|**Description**|
|-|-|
|WDG-MDT-01|This computer runs MDT and Windows 8.1 and is installed in a domain named *mdt2013.corp.woodgrovebank.com* with a network basic input/output system (NetBIOS) name of *MDT2013*. The system resources of the computer are:<br><br> -   Processor running at 1.4 gigahertz (GHz) or faster.<br>-   1 gigabyte (GB) or greater physical memory.<br>-   One disk partition that has 16 GB or more available disk space that will become the drive C partition.<br>-   One CD-ROM or DVD-ROM drive that will be assigned the drive letter D.|
|WDG-REF-01|This is the reference computer and runs no current operating system. The system resources of the computer are:<br><br> -   Processor running at 1.4 GHz or faster.<br>-   1 GB or more of physical memory.<br>-   16 GB or more of available disk space.|

   |**Summary**|Select **Next**.|
   |**Progress**|The progress for importing the operating system is displayed.|
   |**Confirmation**|Select **Finish**.|

   The Import Operating System Wizard finishes. Windows 8.1 is added to the list of operating systems in the details pane and copied to the *deployment_share*\Operating Systems\\*operating_system* folder (where *deployment_share* is the shared network folder you created earlier in the process and *operating_system* is the name of the operating system you added to the deployment share).

###  <a name="AddDriverstoDeployShare"></a> Step 3-3: Add Device Drivers to the Deployment Share

After you have added Windows 8.1 to the Deployment Workbench, add any device drivers required for the reference computer (WDG-REF-01) and the target computer (WDG-CLI-01). These device drivers will be added to Windows PE and deployed with Windows 8.1. Add the device drivers in the Out-of-box Drivers node in the Deployment Workbench by using the New Driver Wizard, which copies the device driver files to the deployment share in Out-of-Box Drivers\\*device_driver* (where *device_driver* is the name of the device driver you added to the deployment share).

> [!NOTE]
>
> If the device drivers for the reference computer (WDG-REF-01) and the target computer (WDG-CLI-01) are included with Windows 8.1, skip this step and proceed with the following step.

 **To add the device drivers for the reference and target computers to the distribution share**

1. Select **Start**, and then point to **All Programs**. Point to **Microsoft Deployment Toolkit**, and then select **Deployment Workbench**.

2. In the Deployment Workbench console tree, go to Deployment Workbench/Deployment Shares/MDT Deployment Share (C:\DeploymentShare$)/Out-of-Box Drivers.

   |**Summary**|Select **Next**.|
   |Progress|The progress for importing the device drivers is displayed.|
   |**Confirmation**|Select **Finish**.|

   The Import Driver Wizard finishes. The device drivers are added to the list of operating systems in the details pane and are copied to the *deployment_share*\Out-of-box Drivers folder (where *deployment_share* is the deployment share you created earlier in the process).

###  <a name="CreateTaskSequence"></a> Step 3-4: Create a Task Sequence for the Reference Computer

Create MDT task sequences in the Task Sequences node in the Deployment Workbench using the New Task Sequence Wizard. MDT includes the Standard Client Task Sequence template, which you can use to deploy the target operating system to the reference computer (WDG-REF-01).

 **To create a task sequence for deploying the reference computer**

1. Select **Start**, and then point to **All Programs**. Point to **Microsoft Deployment Toolkit**, and then select **Deployment Workbench**.

   The Import Task Sequence Wizard finishes, and the **Deploy Windows 8.1 to Reference Computer** task sequence is added to the list of task sequences.

###  <a name="EnableLTIDeployMonitor"></a> Step 3-5: Enable LTI Deployment Process Monitoring

Prior to deploying the reference computer (WDG-REF-01) with the LTI bootable media you created earlier in the process, enable monitoring of the LTI deployment process. You monitor the LTI deployment process in the Monitoring node in the deployment share. You enable monitoring on the **Monitoring** tab on the deployment share properties sheet. Later in the process, you will monitor the LTI deployment process.

 **To enable monitoring of the LTI deployment process**

1. Select **Start**, and then point to **All Programs**. Point to **Microsoft Deployment Toolkit**, and then select **Deployment Workbench**.

2. In the Deployment Workbench console tree, go to Deployment Workbench/Deployment Shares.

3. In the details pane, select **MDT Deployment Share (C:\DeploymentShare$)**.

4. In the Actions pane, select **Properties**

     The **MDT Deployment Share (C:\DeploymentShare$) Properties** dialog box opens.

5. In the **MDT Deployment Share (C:\DeploymentShare$) Properties** dialog box, on the **Monitoring** tab, select the **Enable monitoring for this deployment share** check box, and then select **Apply**.

6. In the **MDT Deployment Share (C:\DeploymentShare$) Properties** dialog box, on the **Rules** tab, notice that the **EventService** property has been added to the CustomSettings.ini file, and then select **OK**.

7. Close all open windows and dialog boxes.

###  <a name="UpdateDeployShare"></a> Step 3-6: Update the Deployment Share

After configuring the deployment share, update it. Updating the deployment share updates all the MDT configuration files and generates a customized version of Windows PE. You use the customized version of Windows PE to start the reference computer and initiate LTI deployment.

 **To update the deployment share in the Deployment Workbench**

1. Select **Start**, and then point to **All Programs**. Point to **Microsoft Deployment Toolkit**, and then select **Deployment Workbench**.

2. In the Deployment Workbench console tree, go to Deployment Workbench/Deployment Shares.

3. In the details pane, select **MDT Deployment Share (C:\DeploymentShare$)**.

4. In the Actions pane, select **Update Deployment Share**.

    The Update Deployment Share Wizard starts.

5. Complete the Update Deployment Share Wizard using the following information. Accept the default values unless otherwise specified.

   |**On this wizard page**|**Do this**|
   |-|-|
   |**Options**|Select **Next**.|
   |**Summary**|Select **Next**.|
   |**Progress**|The progress for updating the deployment share is displayed.|
   |**Confirmation**|Select **Finish**.|

   The Deployment Workbench starts updating the MDT Deployment Share (C:\DeploymentShare$) deployment share. The Deployment Workbench also creates the LiteTouchPE_x64.iso and LiteTouchPE_x64.wim files (for 64-bit target computers) or LiteTouchPE_x86.iso and LiteTouchPE_x86.wim files (for 32-bit target computers) in the *deployment_share*\Boot folder (where *deployment_share* is the network shared folder used as the deployment share).

## Step 4: Deploy Windows 8.1 and Capture an Image of the Reference Computer

After creating the task sequence to deploy Windows 8.1 to the reference computer, initiate operating system deployment and image capture by starting the reference computer with the LTI bootable media.

 Deploy Windows 8.1 and capture an image of the reference computer by:

- Creating the LTI bootable media as described in [Step 4-1: Create the LTI Bootable Media](#CreateLTIBootable)

- Starting the reference computer with the LTI bootable media and monitoring the LTI deployment process as described in [Step 4-2: Start the Reference Computer with the LTI Bootable Media](#StartRefCompwithLTIBootable)

###  <a name="CreateLTIBootable"></a> Step 4-1: Create the LTI Bootable Media

You need to provide a method for starting the computer with the customized version of Windows PE you created when you updated the deployment share. The Deployment Workbench creates the LiteTouchPE_x64.iso and LiteTouchPE_x64.wim files (for 64-bit target computers) or LiteTouchPE_x86.iso and LiteTouchPE_x86.wim files (for 32-bit target computers) in the *deployment_share*\Boot folder (where *deployment_share* is the network shared folder used as the deployment share). Create the appropriate LTI bootable media from one of these images.

 **To create the LTI bootable media**

1. In Windows Explorer, go to C:\DeploymentShare$\Boot.

2. Based on the type of computer used for the reference computer (WDG-REF-01), perform one of the following tasks:

    - If the reference computer is a physical computer, create a physical CD or DVD of the LiteTouchPE_x64.iso or LiteTouchPE_x86.iso file.

    - If the reference computer is a VM, start the VM directly from the LiteTouchPE_x64.iso or LiteTouchPE_x86.iso file or from a CD or DVD of the International Standard Organization (ISO) files.

###  <a name="StartRefCompwithLTIBootable"></a> Step 4-2: Start the Reference Computer with the LTI Bootable Media

Start the reference computer (WDG-REF-01) with the LTI bootable media you created earlier in the process. The LTI bootable media starts Windows PE on the reference computer and initiates deployment. At the end of the MDT deployment process, Windows 8.1 is deployed on the reference computer.

> [!NOTE]
>
> You can use a 32-bit boot image to deploy both 32-bit and 64-bit operating systems; however, a 64-bit boot image can only be used to deploy 64-bit operating systems.

 You could also initiate the process by starting the target computer from Windows Deployment Services. For more information, see the section, "Preparing Windows Deployment Services", in the MDT document, *Using the Microsoft Deployment Toolkit*.

 **To start the reference computer with the LTI bootable media**

1. Start WDG-REF-01 with the LTI bootable media you created earlier in the process.

    Windows PE starts, and then the Windows Deployment Wizard starts.

2. Complete the Windows Deployment Wizard using the following information. Accept the default values unless otherwise specified.

    Windows 8.1 is now installed on the reference computer, and the captured Windows Imaging Format (WIM) file of the reference computer (WIN7_REFERENCE.wim) is stored in the *deployment_share*\Captures folder (where *deployment_share* is the shared folder used as the deployment share).If errors or warnings occur, consult the MDT document *Troubleshooting Reference*.

## Step 5: Configure MDT to Deploy Windows 8.1 to the Target Computer

When you have captured an image of the reference computer (MDT-REF-01), deploy it to the target computer (MDT-CLI-01). You import the captured image into the Deployment Workbench using the Import Operating System Wizard. Then, you create a task sequence to deploy the captured image to the target computer.

 Configure MDT to deploy Windows 8.1 to the target computer by:

- Adding the captured image of the reference computer to the Deployment Workbench as described in [Step 5-1: Add the Captured Image of the Reference Computer to the Deployment Workbench](#AddCapturedImagetoDeployWB)

- Creating a task sequence for the target computer as described in [Step 5-2: Create a Task Sequence for the Target Computer](#CreateTaskSequenceforTarget)

###  <a name="AddCapturedImagetoDeployWB"></a> Step 5-1: Add the Captured Image of the Reference Computer to the Deployment Workbench

To deploy the captured image of the reference computer to the target computer, add the captured image to the list of operating systems in the Operating Systems node in the Deployment Workbench. The Import Operating System Wizard copies the operating system files to the *deployment_share*\Operating Systems\\*operating_system* folder (where *deployment_share* is the deployment share folder created earlier in the process and *operating_system* is the name of the operating system added to the deployment share).

 **To add the captured image of the reference computer to the Deployment Workbench**

1. Select **Start**, and then point to **All Programs**. Point to **Microsoft Deployment Toolkit**, and then select **Deployment Workbench**.

2. In the Deployment Workbench console tree, go to Deployment Workbench/Deployment Shares/MDT Deployment Share (C:\DeploymentShare$)/Operating Systems.

3. In the Actions pane, select **Import Operating system**.

     The Import Operating System Wizard starts.

4. Complete the Import Operating System Wizard using the information in the following table.

    |**On this wizard page**|**Do this**|
    |-|-|
    |**OS Type**|Select **Custom image file**, and then select **Next**.|
    |**Image**|In **Source file**, type **C:\DeploymentShare$\Captures\WIN8_REFERENCE.wim**, and then select **Next**.|
    |**Setup**|Select **Next**.|
    |**Destination**|Select **Next**.|
    |**Summary**|Select **Next**.|
    |**Progress**|The progress for importing the operating system is displayed.|
    |**Confirmation**|Select **Finish**.|

     The Import Operating System Wizard finishes. The captured image of the reference computer (WDG-REF-01) operating system is added to the list of operating systems in the details pane and is copied to the *deployment_share*\Operating Systems\\*operating_system* folder (where *deployment_share* is the deployment share folder created earlier in the process and *operating_system* is the name of the operating system added to the deployment share).

5. Close all open windows and dialog boxes.

###  <a name="CreateTaskSequenceforTarget"></a> Step 5-2: Create a Task Sequence for the Target Computer

Create an MDT task sequence for the target computer in the Task Sequences node in the Deployment Workbench using the New Task Sequence Wizard. This task sequence is used to deploy the captured image of the reference computer to the target computer.

 **To create a task sequence for deploying the captured image to the target computer**

1. Select **Start**, and then point to **All Programs**. Point **to Microsoft Deployment Toolkit**, and then select **Deployment Workbench**.

2. In the Deployment Workbench console tree, go to Deployment Workbench/Deployment Shares/MDT Deployment Share (C:DeploymentShare$)/Task Sequences.

3. In the Actions pane, select **New Task Sequence**.

    The New Task Sequence Wizard starts.

4. Complete the New Task Sequence Wizard using the following information. Accept the default values unless otherwise specified.

## Step 6: Deploy the Captured Image of the Reference Computer to the Target Computer

When you have captured an image of the reference computer and created and configured the appropriate task sequence, deploy the captured image. Configure MDT to provide all the necessary configuration settings for deployment to the target computer. After initiating the deployment process, the image of the reference computer running Windows 8.1 is automatically deployed to the target computer and configured with the settings defined.

 Deploy the captured image of the reference computer to the target computer by:

- Starting the target computer with the LTI bootable media and monitor the LTI deployment process as described in [Step 6-1: Start the Target Computer with the LTI Bootable Media](#StartTargetwithLTIBootable)

###  <a name="StartTargetwithLTIBootable"></a> Step 6-1: Start the Target Computer with the LTI Bootable Media

Start the target computer (WDG-CLI-01) with the LTI bootable media you created earlier in the process. This CD starts Windows PE on the target computer and initiates deployment. At the end of the process, Windows 8.1 is deployed on the target computer.

> [!NOTE]
