# Quick Start Guide for Microsoft System Center 2012 R2 Configuration Manager

Microsoft Deployment Toolkit (MDT) 2013 provides technology for deploying Windows operating systems, and Microsoft Office. This quick start guide helps you quickly evaluate MDT 2013 by providing condensed, step-by-step instructions for using it to install the Windows 8.1 operating system with Microsoft System Center 2012 R2 Configuration Manager. This quick start guide demonstrates how to perform the New Computer deployment scenario, which covers the deployment of Windows 8.1 to a new computer. This scenario assumes that there is no user data or profile to preserve.

> [!NOTE]
>
> In this document, *Windows* applies to the Windows 8.1, Windows 8, Windows 7, Windows ServerÂ® 2012 R2, Windows Server 2012, and Windows Server 2008 R2 operating systems unless otherwise noted. MDT does not support ARM processor-based versions of Windows. Similarly, *MDT* refers to MDT 2013 unless otherwise stated.

 After using this guide to evaluate MDT, review the rest of the MDT guidance to learn more about the technology's advanced features.

## Prerequisites

Zero Touch Installation installations using Configuration Manager have the following prerequisites.

### Required Software

To complete this guide, the following software is required:

- Windows Server 2008 R2

- Microsoft SQL Server 2008 R2

- SQL Server 2008 R2 Service Pack 1 (SP1)

- SQL Server 2008 R2 SP1 Cumulative Update 6 (CU6)

- Windows 8.1

- System Center 2012 R2 Configuration Manager

- Microsoft .NET Framework version 3.5 with SP1

- Windows PowerShell version 2.0

- Windows Preinstallation Environment (Windows PE), which is included in Configuration Manager

- Networking services, including Domain Name System (DNS) and Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)

- Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)

  See the [Supported Configurations for Configuration Manager](/previous-versions/system-center/system-center-2012-R2/gg682077(v=technet.10)) for additional software combinations that can be used for installing Configuration Manager.

> [!NOTE]
>
> The Task Sequencer used in MDT deployments requires that the Create Global Object right be assigned to credentials used to access and run the Deployment Workbench and the deployment process. This right is normally available to accounts with Administrator-level permissions (unless explicitly removed). Also, the Specialized Security - Limited Functionality (SSLF) security profile removes the Create Global Object right and should not be applied to computers deployed using MDT.

### Computer Configuration

To complete this guide, set up the computers listed in the following table. These computers can be either physical computers or virtual machines (VMs) with the system resources designated.

|**Computer**|**Description and system resources**|

Also, you can extend the schema after you have installed Configuration Manager. For more information about how to extend the Active Directory schema for Configuration Manager, see the section, "Extend the Active Directory Schema," in the Configuration Manager Documentation Library, which is installed with Configuration Manager.

 After extending the Active Directory schema, install Configuration Manager. The configuration of WDG-MDT-01 supports Configuration Manager for this sample. The configuration of computers in the production network may vary. To find out more about the prerequisites for installing Configuration Manager, see [Supported Configurations for Configuration Manager](/previous-versions/system-center/system-center-2012-R2/gg682077(v=technet.10)).

##  <a name="PrepareMDTEnvironment"></a> Step 2: Prepare the MDT Environment

The first step in the deployment process is to prepare the MDT environment. When this step is complete, you can create the reference computer and deploy a captured image of it to the target computer (WDG-CLI-01) using Configuration Manager integration with MDT.

 Prepare the MDT environment by:

- Installing MDT as described in [Step 2-1: Install MDT](#InstallMDT)

- Enabling Configuration Manager console integration by running the Configure ConfigMgr Integration script as described in [Step 2-2: Enable Configuration Manager Console Integration](#EnableConfigManagerConsole)

###  <a name="InstallMDT"></a> Step 2-1: Install MDT

To install MDT, complete the following steps:

1. In Windows Explorer, go to E:\Source$\MDT_2013.

2. Double-click **MicrosoftDeploymentToolkit2013_x64.msi** (for 64-bit operating systems) or **MicrosoftDeploymentToolkit2013_x86.msi** (for 32-bit operating systems), and then select **Install**.

    The Microsoft Deployment Toolkit 2013 Setup Wizard starts.

3. Complete the Microsoft Deployment Toolkit 2013 Setup Wizard using the information in  the following table.  Accept the default values unless otherwise specified.

   |**Completing the Microsoft Deployment Toolkit 2013 Setup Wizard**|Select **Finish**.|

   The Microsoft Deployment Toolkit 2013 Setup Wizard finishes, and MDT is installed on WDG-MDT-01.

###  <a name="EnableConfigManagerConsole"></a> Step 2-2: Enable Configuration Manager Console Integration

Before you can use the Configuration Manager integration features of MDT, run the Configure ConfigMgr Integration script. This script copies the appropriate integration files to the folder in which Configuration Manager is installed. The script also adds Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) classes for the new MDT custom actions. The classes are added by compiling a new Managed Object Format (.mof) file that contains the new class definitions.

 **To enable Configuration Manager console integration**

> [!NOTE]
>
> Ensure that the Configuration Manager console is closed while performing these steps.

1. Select **Start**, and then point to **All Programs**. Point to **Microsoft Deployment Toolkit**, and then select **Configure ConfigMgr Integration**.

    The Configure ConfigMgr Integration Wizard starts.

2. Complete the Configure ConfigMgr Integration Wizard using the information in the following table. Accept the default values unless otherwise specified.

   |**On this wizard page**|**Do this**|
   |-|-|
   |**Options**|1. Verify that the **Install the MDT console extensions for System Center 2012 R2 Configuration Manager** check box is selected.<br>2. Verify that the **Add the MDT task sequence actions to a System Center 2012 R2 Configuration Manager server** check box is selected.<br>3. In **Site server name**, verify that the value is **WDG-MDT-01.mdt2013.corp.woodgrovebank.com**.<br>4. In **Site code**, verify that the value is **NYC**.<br>5. Select **Next**.|
   |**Confirmation**|Select **Finish**.|

   The Configure ConfigMgr Integration Wizard finishes, and MDT is integrated with Configuration Manager.

## Step 3: Create and Configure a Task Sequence to Create a Reference Computer

When you have prepared the MDT environment, create the reference computer. The reference computer is the template for deploying new images to the target computers. Configure this computer (WDG-REF-01) exactly as you will configure the target computers. You will then capture an image of the reference computer and deploy the image to the target computers.

 Create the reference computer, WDG-REF-01, by:

- Creating an MDT task sequence to deploy Windows 8.1 to the reference computer as described in [Step 3-1: Create an MDT Task Sequence for Deploying the Reference Computer](#CreateMDTTaskSequence)

- Selecting the distribution points for the new packages and images that the Create MDT Task Sequence Wizard creates as described in [Step 3-2: Select the Distribution Points for the New Packages and Images](#SelectDistroPoints)

- Adding the necessary device drivers to a new drive package and to the appropriate boot images as described in [Step 3-3: Add the Necessary Device Drivers](#AddDeviceDrivers)

- Enable monitoring of the MDT deployment process as described in [Step 3-4: Enable MDT Deployment Process Monitoring](#EnableMDTDeployProcess)

- Configuring the MDT configuration files for the reference computerâspecifically, the CustomSettings.ini fileâas described in [Step 3-5: Customize the MDT Configuration Files for the Reference Computer](#CustomizeMDTConfigFiles)

- Updating the Configuration Manager distribution points for the Custom Settings Files package as described in [Step 3-6: Update the Distribution Points for the Custom Settings Files Package](#UpdateDistroPoint)

- Customizing the task sequence for the reference computer as described in [Step 3-7: Customize the Task Sequence for the Reference Computer](#CustomizeTaskSequence)

###  <a name="CreateMDTTaskSequence"></a> Step 3-1: Create an MDT Task Sequence for Deploying the Reference Computer

Use the Create MDT Task Sequence Wizard in the Configuration Manager console to create task sequences in Configuration Manager that are integrated with MDT. MDT includes the Standard Client Task Sequence template, which you can use to deploy the reference computer.

 The Create MDT Task Sequence Wizard substitutes the packages and images selected for the placeholders in the task sequence templates. After completing the wizard, the new task sequence references the appropriate packages and images.

> [!NOTE]
>
> Always use the Create MDT Task Sequence Wizard to create task sequences based on the MDT task sequence templates. Although you can manually import the task sequence templates, Microsoft does not recommend this process.

#### To create a task sequence for deploying the reference computer

1. Select **Start**, point to **All Programs**, and then point to **Microsoft System Center 2012**. Point to **Configuration Manager**, and then select **Configuration Manager Console**.

2. In the Configuration Manager console, in the navigation pane, select **Software Library**.

###  <a name="CustomizeMDTConfigFiles"></a> Step 3-5: Customize the MDT Configuration Files for the Reference Computer

When the MDT task sequence has been created, customize the MDT configuration files that provide the configuration settings for deploying Windows 8.1 to the target computer. Specifically, customize the CustomSettings.ini file.

 When the CustomSettings.ini file customization is finished, save the updated files to the source folder for the MDT Reference Computer Custom Settings package created earlier in the process (E:\Packages$\CustomSettings_Reference). Then, add the **DoCapture** and **EventService** properties and corresponding values to the CustomSettings.ini file so that the MDT deployment process captures an image of the reference computer (WDG-REF-01) after deploying Windows 8.1.

#### To customize the MDT configuration files for the reference computer

1. In Windows Explorer, go to E:\Packages$\CustomSettings_Reference, and then double-click **CustomSettings.ini**.

2. Open Microsoft Notepad, and then add the following lines to the end of the CustomSettings.ini file:

    ```ini
    DoCapture=YES
    EventService=http://WDG-MDT-01:9800
    ```

    Example of CustomSettings.ini file after adding the DoCapture property:

    ```ini
    [Settings]
    Priority=Default
    Properties=MyCustomProperty

    [Default]
    OSInstall=Y
    SkipCapture=YES
    SkipAdminPassword=NO
    SkipProductKey=YES
    DoCapture=YES
    EventService=http://WDG-MDT-01:9800
    ```

3. In Notepad, save the file, and then exit Notepad.

###  <a name="UpdateDistroPoint"></a> Step 3-6: Update the Distribution Points for the Custom Settings Files Package

When the source folder has been updated for the MDT Reference Computer Custom Settings package in Configuration Manager, update the distribution points for the MDT Reference Computer Custom Settings Files package. Updating the distribution points copies the updated version of the CustomSettings.ini file to the deployment shares specified in the package.

 **To update the distribution points for the Custom Settings package**

1. Select **Start**, point to **All Programs**, and then point to **Microsoft System Center 2012**. Point to **Configuration Manager**, and then select **Configuration Manager Console**.

2. In the Configuration Manager console, in the navigation pane, select **Software Library**.

   Configuration Manager starts updating the distribution points with the latest versions of the CustomSettings.ini file. This process could take several minutes. Check the status of the package until the **Last Update** value of the package status has been updated to a recent date and time.

###  <a name="CustomizeTaskSequence"></a> Step 3-7: Customize the Task Sequence for the Reference Computer

For most deployments, the **Windows 8.1 Reference Deployment** task sequence created earlier in the process performs all the necessary steps without modification. In this sample, modify the task sequence to set the password for the local Administrator account to a known value. By default, the task sequence sets the password for the local Administrator account to a random value. Further customization of the task sequence may be required depending on the environment.

 **To customize the Windows 8.1 Reference Deployment task sequence**

1. Select **Start**, point to **All Programs**, and then point to **Microsoft System Center 2012**. Point to **Configuration Manager**, and then select **Configuration Manager Console**.

2. In the Configuration Manager console, in the navigation pane, select **Software Library**.

3. In the Software Library workspace, go to Overview/Operating Systems/Task Sequences.

4. In the preview pane, select **Windows 8.1 Reference Deployment**.

5. On the Ribbon, on the **Home** tab, in the **Task Sequence** group, select **Edit**.

   The wizard creates the CM2012_TS_Boot_Media.iso file in the WDG-MDT-01Capture$ shared folder.

6. If WDG-REF-01 is a physical computer, create a CD or DVD of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) file. If WDG-REF-01 is a VM, start the VM directly from the ISO file.

   For more information on creating the task sequence bootable media disk, see the section, "How to Create Bootable Media," in the Configuration manager Documentation Library, which is installed with Configuration Manager.

###  <a name="StartRefCompwithTaskSeqBootMedia"></a> Step 4-5: Start the Reference Computer with the Task Sequence Bootable Media

Start the reference computer (WDG-REF-01) with the task sequence bootable media disk created earlier in the process. This medium starts Windows PE on the reference computer and initiates the MDT process. At the end of the MDT process, Windows 8.1 is deployed on the reference computer and an image of the reference computer is saved to \WDG-MDT-01\Capture$\WDG-REF-01.wim.

> [!NOTE]
>
> You can also initiate the MDT process by starting the target computer from Windows Deployment Services.

#### To start the reference computer with the task sequence bootable media

   VMName             : WDG-REF-01
   ComputerIdentities : {}
   ```

4. Close the Windows PowerShell console.

   If any problems occur during the deployment, consult the MDT document *Troubleshooting Reference*. When completed, a captured image of the reference computer should exist in \\\WDG-MDT-01\Capture$\WDG-REF-01.wim.

## Step 5: Create and Configure a Task Sequence to Deploy the Target Computer

After the task sequence to deploy the reference computer (WDG-REF-01) finishes, a captured image of the reference computer is stored in \\\WDG-MDT-01\Capture$\WDG-REF-01.wim. Now, create a task sequence that will deploy the captured image of the reference computer to the target computer (WDG-CLI-01). When this step is complete, you can deploy the captured image of the reference computer to the target computer.

 Create and configure a task sequence to deploy the target computer by:

- Importing the .wim file captured in the previous step into Configuration Manager using the Add Operating System Image Wizard as described in [Step 5-1: Import the Captured .wim File into Configuration Manager](#ImportCapturedwimFile)

- Using the Create MDT Task Sequence Wizard to create an MDT task sequence template to deploy the captured image of the reference computer to the target computer as described in [Step 5-2: Create an MDT Task Sequence to Deploy the Captured Image](#CreateMDTTaskSeqDeployCapturedImage)

- Selecting the distribution points for the new packages and images that the Create MDT Task Sequence Wizard creates as described in [Step 5-3: Select the Distribution Points for the New Packages and Images](#SelectDistroPointsNewPackagesImages)

- Customizing the MDT configuration files for the target computerâspecifically, the CustomSettings.ini fileâas described in [Step 5-4: Customize the MDT Configuration Files](#CustomizetheMDTConfigFiles)

- Updating the Configuration Manager distribution points for the Custom Settings package as described in [Step 5-5: Update the Distribution Points for the Custom Settings Package](#UpdateDistroPointsforCustomSettings)

- Customizing the task sequence for the target computer as described in [Step 5-6: Customize the Task Sequence for the Target Computer](#CustomizeTaskSequenceTargetComputer)

###  <a name="ImportCapturedwimFile"></a> Step 5-1: Import the Captured .wim File into Configuration Manager

After the image of the reference computer (WDG-REF-01) is captured in to the .wim file, import the captured .wim file into Configuration Manager. Import the captured .wim file into the Operating System Images node using the Add Operating System Image Wizard.

 The captured .wim contains two images, one for each partition on the reference computer. Identify which of the images has the captured Windows 8.1 operating system by checking the image description containing *Windows 8.1*. You will use the image index when you create the task sequence for deploying the captured image to the target computer.

 **To import the captured .wim file into Configuration Manager**

1. Select **Start**, point to **All Programs**, and then point to **Microsoft System Center 2012**. Point to **Configuration Manager**, and then select **Configuration Manager Console**.

2. In the Configuration Manager console, in the navigation pane, select **Software Library**.

3. In the Software Library workspace, go to Overview/Operating Systems/Operating System Images.

4. On the Ribbon, in the **Create** group, select **Add Operating System Image**.

     The Add Operating System Image Wizard starts.

5. Complete the Add Operating System Image Wizard using the following information. Accept the default values unless otherwise specified.

    |**On this wizard page**|**Do this**|
    |-|-|
    |**On this wizard page**|**Do this**|
    |**Data Source**|In **Path**, type **\\\WDG-MDT-01\Capture$\WDG-REF-01.wim**, and then select **Next**.|
    |**General**|1. In **Name**, type **Windows 8.1 Reference Image**.<br><br> 1. In **Version**, type **1.00**.<br><br> 1. In **Comments**, type **Windows 8.1 captured image of reference computer (WDG-REF-01) used to deploy to target computers**, and then select **Next**.|
    |**Summary**|1. Review the information in the **Details** box  that you provided while completing the previous wizard pages.<br>2. Select **Next**.|
    |**Progress**|The progress for importing the operating system image is displayed.|
    |**Completion**|Select **Close**.|

6. In the preview pane, select **Windows 8.1 Reference Image**.

7. In the preview pane, select the **Details** tab.

     The list of operating system partitions captured in the .wim is displayed. The image index that contains Windows 8.1 is the image index you will specify later during the Create MDT Task Sequence Wizard.

8. Record the image index that contains Windows 8.1.

    > [!TIP]
    >
    > For the purposes of this example, image index 2 should have the Windows 8.1 operating system.

###  <a name="CreateMDTTaskSeqDeployCapturedImage"></a> Step 5-2: Create an MDT Task Sequence to Deploy the Captured Image

After the image is captured, create a task sequence to deploy the captured image of the reference computer (WDG-REF-01) to the target computer (WDG-CLI-01). Most of the packages needed for this task sequence were created earlier in the process. However, you must create a new MDT Custom Settings package that has the proper configuration settings for the target computer and creates an operating system image of the captured image of the reference computer.

#### To create a task sequence template to deploy the captured image to the target computer

1. Select **Start**, point to **All Programs**, and then point to **Microsoft System Center 2012**. Point to **Configuration Manager**, and then select **Configuration Manager Console**.

2. In the Configuration Manager console, in the navigation pane, select **Software Library**.

3. In the Software Library workspace, go to Overview/Operating Systems/Task Sequences.

4. On the Ribbon, on the **Home** tab, in the **Task Sequences** group, select **Create MDT Task Sequence**.

    The Create MDT Task Sequence Wizard starts.

5. Complete the Create MDT Task Sequence Wizard using the following information. Accept the default values unless otherwise specified.

###  <a name="CustomizetheMDTConfigFiles"></a> Step 5-4: Customize the MDT Configuration Files

When the task sequence for the target computer has been created, customize the MDT configuration files that provide the configuration settings for deploying Windows 8.1 to the target computerâspecifically, CustomSettings.ini.

 When the CustomSettings.ini file has been customized, save the updated files to the source folder for the MDT Custom Settings package created earlier in the process (E:\Packages$\CustomSettings_Target).

#### To customize the MDT configuration files for the target computer

1. In Windows Explorer, go to E:\Packages$\CustomSettings_Target folder, and then double-click **CustomSettings.ini**.

2. Open Notepad, and then add the following lines to the CustomSettings.ini file:

    ```ini
    EventService=http://WDG-MDT-01:9800
    ```

     This setting will configure monitoring of the target computer deployment.

    > [!NOTE]
    >
    > Make any other changes that are required by your environment.

     **Example of the edited CustomSettings.ini File:**

    ```ini
    [Settings]
    Priority=Default
    Properties=MyCustomProperty

    [Default]
    OSInstall=Y
    SkipCapture=YES
    SkipAdminPassword=NO
    SkipProductKey=YES
    EventService=http://WDG-MDT-01:9800

    ```

3. Save the file, and then close Notepad.

###  <a name="UpdateDistroPointsforCustomSettings"></a> Step 5-5: Update the Distribution Points for the Custom Settings Package

When the source folder has been updated for the MDT Target Computer Custom Settings package in Configuration Manager, update the distribution points for the MDT Target Computer Custom Settings package. Updating the distribution points copies the updated version of the CustomSettings.ini file to the deployment shares specified in the package.

#### To update the distribution points for the Custom Settings package

1. Select **Start**, point to **All Programs**, and then point to **Microsoft System Center 2012**. Point to **Configuration Manager**, and then select **Configuration Manager Console**.

2. In the Configuration Manager console, in the navigation pane, select **Software Library**.

3. In the Software Library workspace, go to Overview/Application Management/Packages.

4. In the preview pane, select **MDT Target Computer Custom Settings**.

5. On the Ribbon, on the **Home** tab, in the **Deployment** group, select **Update Distribution Points**.

     The **Configuration Manager** dialog box opens, notifying you that you are going to update the package on all distribution points.

6. In the **Configuration Manager** dialog box, select **OK**.

7. Close all open windows and dialog boxes.

###  <a name="CustomizeTaskSequenceTargetComputer"></a> Step 5-6: Customize the Task Sequence for the Target Computer

For most deployments, the Windows 8.1 Target Deployment task sequence created earlier in the process performs all the necessary steps without modification. In this sample, modify the task sequence template to set the password for the local Administrator account to a known value. (By default, the task sequence sets the password for the local Administrator account to a random value.) The task sequence may require further customization depending on the environment.

#### To customize the Windows 8.1 Target Deployment task sequence

1. Select **Start**, point to **All Programs**, and then point to **Microsoft System Center 2012**. Point to **Configuration Manager**, and then select **Configuration Manager Console**.

2. In the Configuration Manager console, in the navigation pane, select **Software Library**.

3. In the Software Library workspace, go to Overview/Operating Systems/Task Sequences.

4. In the preview pane, select **Windows 8.1 Reference Deployment**.

5. On the Ribbon, on the **Home** tab, in the **Task Sequence** group, select **Edit**.

    The **Windows 8.1 Reference Deployment Task Sequence Editor** dialog box opens.

6. In the **Windows 8.1 Reference Deployment Task Sequence Editor** dialog box, go to PostInstall/Apply Windows Settings.

7. On the **Properties** tab, select **Enable the account and specify the local administrator password**.

8. On the **Properties** tab, in **Password** and **Confirm Password**, type **P@ssw0rd**, and then select **Apply**.

10. Close all open windows and dialog boxes.


## Step 6: Deploy the Captured Image of the Reference Computer to the Target Computer

When you have captured the image of the reference computer and created and configured the task sequence, deploy the captured image. Configure MDT to provide all the necessary configuration settings to deploy to the target computer. After initiating the deployment process, the image of the reference computer running Windows 8.1 is automatically deployed to the target computer and configured with the settings defined.

 Deploy the captured image by:

- Adding the target computer to the Configuration Manager site database as described in [Step 6-1: Add the Target Computer to the Configuration Manager Site Database](#AddTargetComptoConfigManager)

- Creating a computer collection that includes the target computer as described in [Step 6-2: Create a Computer Collection That Includes the Target Computer](#CreateComputerCollectionIncludesTarget)

- Deploying the task sequence created earlier in the process as described in [Step 6-3: Deploy the Target Computer Task Sequence](#DeployTargetComputerTaskSequence)

- Starting the target computer with the task sequence bootable media as described in [Step 6-4: Start the Target Computer with the Task Sequence Bootable Media](#StartTargetComputerTaskSequenceMedia)

###  <a name="AddTargetComptoConfigManager"></a> Step 6-1: Add the Target Computer to the Configuration Manager Site Database

To deploy an operating system without stand-alone media to a new computer that Configuration Manager does not currently manage, add the new computer to the Configuration Manager site database prior to initiating the operating system deployment process. Configuration Manager can automatically discover computers on the network that have a Windows operating system installed; however, if the computer has no operating system installed, use the Import Computer Information Wizard to import the new computer information.

#### To add the target computer to the Configuration Manager site database

1. Select **Start**, point to **All Programs**, and then point to **Microsoft System Center 2012**. Point to **Configuration Manager**, and then select **Configuration Manager Console**.

2. In the Configuration Manager console, in the navigation pane, select **Assets and Compliance**.

3. In the Assets and Compliance workspace, go to Overview/Devices.

4. On the Ribbon, on the **Home** tab, in the **Create** group, select **Import Computer Information**.

    The Import Computer Information Wizard starts.

5. Complete the Import Computer Information Wizard using the following information. Accept the default values unless otherwise specified.
