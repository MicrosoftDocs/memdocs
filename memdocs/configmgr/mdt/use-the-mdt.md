# Using the Microsoft Deployment Toolkit  
 Microsoft® Deployment Toolkit (MDT) 2013 allows you to automate the deployment of computers in your organization. This document provides guidance on how to plan, build, and deploy Windows® operating systems and applications using MDT 2013.  

> [!NOTE]
>  In this document, *Windows* applies to the Windows 8.1, Windows 8, Windows 7, Windows Server® 2012 R2, Windows Server 2012, and Windows Server 2008 R2 unless otherwise noted. MDT does not support ARM processor–based versions of Windows. Similarly, *MDT* refers to MDT 2013 unless otherwise stated.  

 MDT performs deployments by using the Lite Touch Installation (LTI), Zero Touch Installation (ZTI), and User-Driven Installation (UDI) deployment methods. Only MDT is used in LTI deployments, while ZTI and UDI deployments are performed using MDT with Microsoft System Center 2012 R2 Configuration Manager.  

 This document covers these deployment methods and shows how to customize the deployment process for an organization. In addition to this document, Table 1 lists other documents that will help you perform deployments using MDT in your organization.

##  <a name="PlanningMdtDeployments"></a> Planning MDT Deployments  
 The planning process helps you prepare for deployments in a production environment. The process starts with conceptual designs, which are proven and refined in a test environment. The result of the planning process is a set of design documents that you can use to build an MDT deployment infrastructure and perform automated operating system and application deployments in a production environment.  

###  <a name="OverviewoftheMDTDeploymentProcess"></a> Overview of the MDT Deployment Process  
 The purpose of MDT is to help automate the deployment of Windows operating systems and applications to desktop, portable, and server computers in the environment. At a high level, MDT automates the deployment process by configuring the unattended Setup files for Windows and packaging the necessary files into a consolidated image file that you then deploy to reference and target computers.  

 Figure 1 illustrates the high-level LTI, ZTI, and UDI deployment processes.  

 ![Figure 1 illustrates the high-level LTI, ZTI, and UDI deployment processes.](media/MDTDevToolkit1.jpg)

 **Figure 1. High-level deployment process**  

 The high-level LTI, ZTI, and UDI deployment process is as follows:  

1.  Collect the files necessary to perform an MDT deployment, including:  

    -   Windows operating system source files or images  

    -   Windows operating system language packs  

    -   Device drivers for reference and target computers  

2.  Create the system images, configuration settings, and task sequences to be used in deploying Windows and applications to the reference computers.  

3.  Deploy the system images to the reference computer and capture an image of the reference computer.  

4.  Create the configuration settings and task sequences that will deploy the captured images of the reference computers to the target computers.  

5.  Deploy the captured images of the reference computers to the target computers.  

###  <a name="PlanningChecklist"></a> Planning Checklist  
  Table 3 provides a planning checklist in the form of a list of questions that you can use to help in the planning process. For each question, use the information provided in the **Overview** column to help find answers based on your organization's requirements.  

#### Table 3. Planning Checklist  

|Question|Overview|  
|--------------|--------------|  
|Where will you store your distribution files?|Files for the operating system and applications are stored in deployment shares for LTI and distribution points for ZTI and UDI. These files can require many gigabytes of space. Some organizations might need multiple deployment shares or distribution points for different regional offices.For more information, see [Estimating MDT Storage Requirements](#EstimatingMDTStorageRequirements).|  
|Will you deploy across the network, with removable media, or both? Will you use multicast deployments?|If you are deploying across the network, verify that there is sufficient bandwidth between the deployment shares, distribution points, and the target computers, and provide regional distribution points.For more information, see [Choosing a Deployment Method](#ChoosingaDeploymentMethod) and [Evaluating Network Requirements](#EvaluatingNetworkRequirements).|

###  <a name="EstimatingMDTStorageRequirements"></a> Estimating MDT Storage Requirements  
 LTI deployments store the system images, applications, and other files in deployment shares. ZTI and UDI deployments store these files on Configuration Manager distribution points. To determine your storage needs, estimate storage requirements for:  

-   Computers running MDT as described in [Estimate Storage Requirements for Computers Running MDT](#EstimateStorageRequirementsforComputersRunningMDT)  

-   Each MDT deployment share as described in [Estimate Storage Requirements for MDT Deployment Shares](#EstimateStorageRequirementsforMDTDeploymentShares)  

-   Each Configuration Manager distribution point as described in [Estimate Storage Requirements for Configuration Manager Distribution Points](#EstimateStorageRequirementsforConfigurationManagerDistributionPoints)  

-   User state migration data as described in [Estimate Storage Requirements for User State Migration Data](#EstimateStorageRequirementsforUserStateMigrationData)  

-   Backing up existing computers prior to deployment for Refresh Computer deployment scenario as described in [Estimate Storage Requirements for Target Computer Backup](#EstimateStorageRequirementsforTargetComputerBackup)  

####  <a name="EstimateStorageRequirementsforComputersRunningMDT"></a> Estimate Storage Requirements for Computers Running MDT  
 The computer running MDT has the following storage requirements:  

-   At least 4 gigabytes (GB) of free space is required on the drive containing the %TEMP% folder if you will create a media images. Otherwise, 1 GB of free space is required on the drive containing the %TEMP% folder.  

-   Free space of 1 GB is required on the drive containing the MDT program files.  

####  <a name="EstimateStorageRequirementsforMDTDeploymentShares"></a> Estimate Storage Requirements for MDT Deployment Shares  
 Ensure that sufficient space is available for storing the operating system images, language packs, and device drivers used in the Deployment Workbench. You store these images in the MDT deployment shares created in the Deployment Workbench.  

 Determine the storage requirements for each of the following items in the deployment share:  

- Windows operating system  

- Operating system language pack  

- Device drivers  

- Applications  

  Determine the size of each image and the number of images required in the deployment. Create a unique image for each:  

- **Version of the Windows operating system to be deployed.** A separate image is required for each version of Windows, such as Windows 8.1, Windows 7, Windows Server 2012 R2, or Windows Server 2008 R2.  

- **Edition of the Windows operating system to be deployed.** A separate image is required for each edition of Windows, such as Tablet PC, Ultimate, Business, Enterprise, or Datacenter.  

- **Processor type.** A separate image is required for 32-bit and 64-bit versions of Windows.  

####  <a name="EstimateStorageRequirementsforConfigurationManagerDistributionPoints"></a> Estimate Storage Requirements for Configuration Manager Distribution Points  
 Estimate the storage requirements for Configuration Manager distribution points using the same calculations described in [Estimate Storage Requirements for MDT Deployment Shares](#EstimateStorageRequirementsforMDTDeploymentShares). If the images are distributed to multiple distribution points, the storage requirements apply to each distribution point.  

 For more information about planning Configuration Manager distribution points, see the section, "Distribution Point," in the section, "Planning Configuration Manager Site Systems for Operating System Deployments," in the Configuration Manager Documentation Library, which is installed with Configuration Manager.  

####  <a name="EstimateStorageRequirementsforUserStateMigrationData"></a> Estimate Storage Requirements for User State Migration Data  
 Estimate the amount of storage required for user state migration data that the Windows User State Migration Tool (USMT) saved during the deployment process by:  

-   Determining whether to store the user state migration data locally on the target computers or network shared folders as described in [Determine Where to Store User State Migration Data](#DetermineWheretoStoreUserStateMigrationData)  

-   Determining the storage requirements for the user state migration data as described in [Determine Storage Requirements for User State Migration Data](#DetermineStorageRequirementsforUserStateMigrationData)  

#####  <a name="DetermineWheretoStoreUserStateMigrationData"></a> Determine Where to Store User State Migration Data  
 After determining the storage requirements for the user state migration data, determine where to store the data. Store user state migration data in these locations:  

- On the local computer to reduce the time to deploy Windows as well as network utilization (recommended)  

  > [!NOTE]
  >  This option can be used only in a Refresh Computer scenario.  

- On a shared folder located on a local server to provide a consistent method of storing user state migration data or when local storage is not available.  

  If user state migration data will be stored locally on the target computers, designate a shared folder in which the deploy process can store the data. By default, the process attempts to store user state data on the local hard disk for the Replace Computer and Refresh Computer scenarios. However, you can override this behavior with configuration settings in CustomSettings.ini. In the event that there is insufficient disk space for the user state data and new image, the deployment scripts attempt to store the information in a shared folder. Providing the shared folder as an alternate storage location makes the deployment process more reliable.  

  Create a share on a server designated during the planning process for holding the USMT store files. MDT uses values found in CustomSettings.ini to locate the user state store folder.  

#####  <a name="DetermineStorageRequirementsforUserStateMigrationData"></a> Determine Storage Requirements for User State Migration Data  
 For planning purposes, complete the following tasks to estimate the user state migration storage requirements:  

- Run Scanstate.exe in the USMT with the **/p** option to estimate the size of the user state migration data. By using the **/p** option, you can estimate the disk space requirements without actually performing the migration.  

- View the size of the contents of the folders in the user profile. Randomly sample targeted computers to determine a typical amount of storage required to back up the user state migration. Keep in mind that there may be several profiles (user name folders) on each target computer, so include each profile to be migrated.  

  Calculate the total capacity required by multiplying the average size of the user state migration data by the number of days to retain the data, and then multiplying that result by the number of users to be migrated during the retention period. For example, if the average user state migration size is 3 GB, data must be stored for five days, 100 users are being migrated each day, and the total storage requirement is 1,500 GB (3 GB × 5 days × 100 users per day).  

####  <a name="EstimateStorageRequirementsforTargetComputerBackup"></a> Estimate Storage Requirements for Target Computer Backup  
 As an optional step in the deployment process for the Refresh Computer scenario, you can perform a backup of a target computer before deploying the target operating system.  

 You perform the backup process in MDT by using the Imagex.exe tool. The backup process creates an image of the disk volume on which the user state migration data is stored. The purpose of this backup is for recovery of user state migration data, not to restore the target computer from the image.  

 The storage requirements are a function of the average size of the target computer hard disks, the number of target computers deployed each day, and the length of time you want to retain the backup. For example, if the average target computer hard disk contains 80 GB of data, you are deploying 100 computers per day, and you want to retain the data for one week, the storage requirements for backups are 56 terabytes (TB), or 80 GB × 100 × 7.  

> [!NOTE]
>  By default, the MDT backup process does not back up multiple partitions. If you need to back up multiple partitions, modify the MDT deployment process or use an alternative backup method.  

###  <a name="PlanningforApplicationDeployment"></a> Planning for Application Deployment  
 Applications can be deployed as a part of the operating system image or after the operating system is deployed to the target computer. In preparation for deployment, perform these tasks:  

-   **Create an application portfolio.** Application portfolios include a list of applications and the compatibility status of each application. You can create this application portfolio by using software-inventory software such as the Application Compatibility Toolkit (ACT), the Asset and Compliance feature in Configuration Manager.  

-   **Identify any dependencies between applications.** Applications may have dependencies on other applications. For example, an application may rely on Microsoft Office Excel® 2007. Identify these dependencies, and include the dependent software in the deployment plans.  

-   **Determine whether to deploy applications with the operating system image or afterwards.** You can deploy applications as part of the operating system image or after the operating system is deployed to the target computer. If the application is deployed after the operating system is deployed, you can use any software-deployment software, such as MDT, Group Policy Software Installation, the Application Management feature in Configuration Manager.  

-   **Determine the appropriate method for running applications.** You can install and run applications on the local computer or deploy them dynamically in a virtualized application environment, such as App-V.  

-   **Identify the users approved to install applications.** Determine whether users will install their applications or if the applications need to be installed by deployment technicians. Ensure that the user installing the application has the appropriate rights and permissions.  

-   **Identify applications that require a restart of the operating system.** Applications that require a restart of the operating system after installation require additional configuration. For more information, see [Configure the Computer to Restart After Application Installation](#ConfiguretheComputertoRestartAfterApplicationInstallation).  

###  <a name="DefiningOperatingSystemComponentsandSettings"></a> Defining Operating System Components and Settings  
 As part of establishing a standardized configuration, determine which operating system components to include and the settings for these components. This determination includes optional components in all operating systems, server roles in Windows Server operating systems, and components to include in Windows Preinstallation Environment (Windows PE). For example, you may decide to remove unnecessary Windows operating system components from desktop and portable computer deployments to reduce the security footprint of those computers.  

 For each operating system image, determine the:  

- <strong>Operating system components.</strong>Select the components required for the applications and user roles performed on the target computers. Install only the components that are required to help reduce the attack surface of the target computer and the image size.  

- **Server roles.** Select the server roles required for the server computers. Install only the server roles that are required to help reduce the attack surface of the target computer and the image size.  

- **Windows PE components.** These components include Microsoft ActiveX® Data Objects (ADO) support, fonts, and the necessary drivers and packages. You can select the components for 32-bit and 64-bit versions of Windows PE.  

- **Configuration settings.** Identify the configuration settings for components included in the images. Select configuration settings that meet the business and security requirements of the organization. For more information about target computer security, see [Planning Target Computer Security](#PlanningTargetComputerSecurity).  

###  <a name="ChoosingaDeploymentMethod"></a> Choosing a Deployment Method  
 Typically, target computers have high-speed, persistent connections to the deployment infrastructure. However, some target computers may connect to an intranet remotely or not at all. MDT includes the following methods for deploying operating systems and applications using LTI based on the network connectivity:  

-   **Deployment share.** This method uses a network shared folder in which all the deployment files reside. The target computer starts Windows PE, and then connects to the deployment share to perform the deployment. Select this method when the target computers have high-speed, persistent connections to the deployment infrastructure.  

-   **Media.** This method creates an image that you can use to perform deployments from removable media, such as DVDs or USB flash drives (UFDs). You use Windows PE to start the computer from the media. Select this method when the target computers may be remotely connected or may not have connectivity at all.  

###  <a name="EvaluatingNetworkRequirements"></a> Evaluating Network Requirements  
 Because of the size of the images being distributed to the target computers (500 megabytes [MB] to 4 GB), computers must have a high-speed, persistent connection to the servers used in the deployment process. These servers need to be on adjacent subnets to the target computers to ensure high-speed connectivity to the computers.  

> [!NOTE]
>  Network-based deployments using MDT are not supported for wireless networks. Use media-based deployments for computers connected by wireless networks or networks with slow or unreliable connectivity.  

 If the organization cannot provide sufficient network capacity to deploy images, software, and migration data to computers, perform one of the following actions:  

- Temporarily place the appropriate servers (for example, servers hosting the various shared folders or the server running Windows Deployment Services) closer to the target computers for the duration of the migration.  

- Temporarily move the target computers to a staging area where the computers can be deployed, and then return them to their original location.  

- Store user state migration data locally on the target computers.  

- Perform automated deployments locally using media deployments in LTI.  

  In addition to network capacity, you must enable the appropriate network protocols and traffic. For example, if you want to initiate LTI, ZTI, or UDI deployment using Windows Deployment Services and multicast deployment, you must enable multicast traffic between the MDT infrastructure and target computers.  

###  <a name="UsingReferenceComputersinMDTDeployments"></a> Using Reference Computers in MDT Deployments  
 The MDT deployment process uses the reference computer as a baseline for the configuration of target computers when the deployment process is complete. You configure the reference computer to comply with the business, technical, and security requirements of the organization. After configuring the reference computer, capture an image of the reference computer that you can then deploy to the target computers.  

 Only in rare circumstances will you be able to deploy the images from the Windows distribution media unmodified to the reference and target computers. Instead, create customized images that include the Windows operating system, language, packs, applications, device drivers, software updates, and other software.  

 The MDT deployment process allows for the creation of customized images that are first deployed to a reference computer, then captured from the reference computer, and finally deployed to target computers. MDT manages the customization of images so that you can create them with less effort and higher levels of automation. For example, the Deployment Workbench in MDT can automatically inject the appropriate device drivers into images.  

 VMs work well when creating a reference image for Windows because the historical HAL issues are no longer applicable.  

> [!NOTE]
>  VMs typically do not have the same performance as physical computers, so creating the reference images may take longer.  

###  <a name="ChoosingThickThinorHybridImages"></a> Choosing Thick, Thin, or Hybrid Images  
 As part of the planning process, determine the types of images that you will create. The types of images you can create fall into these categories:  

-   **Thick images.** Thick images are monolithic images that contain core applications, language packs, and other files. Part of the image-development process is installing core applications and language packs on the reference computer before capturing the disk image.  

-   **Thin images.** Thin images contain few if any core applications or language packs, as these components are installed separately from the disk image, which typically takes more network transfer time at the computer.  

-   **Hybrid images.** Hybrid images mix thin and thick image strategies by installing applications and language packs from a network shared folder. Hybrid images have most of the advantages of thin images, but they are not as complex to develop and do not require a software-distribution infrastructure. They do require longer installation times, however, which can raise initial deployment costs.  

Table 4 lists the advantages and disadvantages of the thick, thin, and hybrid images types.  

#### Table 4. Advantages and Disadvantages of Thick, Thin, and Hybrid Images  

|Method|Advantage|Disadvantage|  
|------------|---------------|------------------|  
|Thick|- Can be simpler to deploy, because all applications and language packs are in the image.<br /><br /> - Reduced initial complexity, because advanced scripting is not typically required.<br /><br /> - Applications and language packs are available immediately after deployment is complete.<br /><br /> - Does not require software-distribution software, such as the Application Management feature in Configuration Manager.|- Requires more storage for each image.<br /><br /> - Requires more time to download over network connections than thin or hybrid images.<br /><br /> - Requires an increased image maintenance effort, because any updates to operating systems, device drivers, applications, or language packs requires the creation of a new image.|  
|Thin|- Requires less storage for each image.<br /><br /> - Requires less time than thick images to download over network connections.<br /><br /> -Reduced image maintenance effort, because the image contains fewer components.|- Can be more complex to createinitially, because additional steps are required during image creation.<br /><br /> - Potential for increased complexity, because advanced scripting may be required.<br /><br /> - Applications and languages are not immediately available after image deployment is complete.|  
|Hybrid|- Requires less storage than thick images for each image.<br /><br /> - Requires less time to than thick a thick image to download over network connections.<br /><br /> - Reduced image maintenance effort, because the image contains fewer components.<br /><br /> - Does not require separate software-distribution software.|- Can be more complex than a thick image (but not than a thin image) to create, because additional steps are required during image creation.<br /><br /> - Potential for increased complexity, because advanced scripting (though not as advanced as in thin images) may be required.<br /><br /> - pplications and languages are not immediately available after image deployment is complete.|  

 The costs associated with building, maintaining, and deploying disk images includes:  

- **Development costs.** Development costs include creating a well-engineered image to lower future support costs and improve security and reliability. Higher levels of automation reduce development costs.  

- **Test costs.** These costs include the time and labor involved in testing the standard image and the applications that might reside inside it in addition to applications applied after deployment. Test costs also include the development time required to stabilize disk images.  

- **Storage costs.** Storage costs include storing the distribution points, disk images, migration data, and backup images. Storage costs can be significant depending on the number of disk images, the number of computers in each deployment run, and so on.  

- **Network costs.** Network costs include moving disk images to distribution points and to computers. The disk-imaging technologies that Microsoft provides do not support multicasting, so network costs scale linearly with the number of distribution points you must replicate and the number of computers in the deployment project.  

  As the size of image files increases, costs increase. Large images have more updating, testing, distribution, network, and storage costs associated with them. Even if only a small portion of the image is updated, the entire image must be redistributed.  

###  <a name="IdentifyingDeploymentScenarios"></a> Identifying Deployment Scenarios  
 Table 5 lists the deployment scenarios and provides a brief description of each.  

#### Table 5. Deployment Scenarios  

|**Scenario** |**Description** |**Migrates user state** |**Uses existing target computer** |**Preserves file system** |  
|------------------|---------------------|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------|-------------------------------|  
|New Computer|A new installation of a Windows operating system is deployed to a new computer.|No|No|No|  
|Refresh Computer|A computer is refreshed, including computers that must be re-imaged for image standardization or to address a problem.|Yes|Yes|No|  
|Replace Computer|One computer replaces another computer. The existing user state migration data is saved from the original computer. Then, a new installation of Windows is deployed to a new computer. Finally, the user state data is restored to the new computer.|Yes|No|No|  

 MDT does not support in-place upgrade deployments. You can perform:  

- An in-place upgrade manually by running Setup.exe from the original Windows media  

  > [!NOTE]
  >  To perform an in-place upgrade manually by running Setup.exe from the original Windows media, use the original install.wim file. Custom .wim files are not supported for in-place upgrades.  

- The Refresh Computer scenario as an alternative for deploying a new operating system and applications on the target computer  

  As part of the Replace Computer deployment scenario, wipe the disk partitions of the original computer. The standard format as performed by Windows operating systems does not perform a secure wipe of the disk as defined by U.S. Department of Defense standard 5520.22M. If required, perform secure wipes of hard disks in target computers using tools provided by non-Microsoft vendors.  

###  <a name="PlanningforBitLockerDriveEncryption"></a> Planning for BitLocker Drive Encryption  
 BitLocker is included in Windows so include planning decisions for BitLocker in your environment. One BitLocker decision you must make is the storage of the recovery keys. You can store BitLocker recovery keys in:  

- `A local folder.` Select this option to store the recovery key on UFDs, which each user manages.  

- **A network folder.** Select this option to centrally store the recovery keys in a network shared folder, which network administrators manage.  

- **Active Directory® Domain Services (AD DS).** Select this option to store the recovery keys in AD DS, which Active Directory administrators manage.  

  Also, elect the methods users will employ to start their computers after BitLocker is enabled. Users can start their computers using one of the following methods:  

- **Trusted Platform Module (TPM) version 1.2 or later.** TPM is a cryptographic hardware chip installed on the target computer. If the target computer does not support TPM, a UFD or PIN must be used to start the computer. This is the preferred method if the target computer supports TPM.

  >  You can provide a PIN that users can enter in conjunction with TPM, or you can use a UFD to strengthen the security when starting a computer.  

- **UFD.** In this method, the required encryption keys are stored on a UFD, which must be present in the computer when the computer starts. This is the preferred method if the target computer does not support TPM.

###  <a name="EvaluatingTargetComputerReadiness"></a> Evaluating Target Computer Readiness  
 As part of the planning process, evaluate target computer readiness for the deployment of the target operating system, device drivers, applications, and other components. Evaluate target computer readiness using automated hardware and software inventory tools, such as Configuration Manager or the Microsoft Assessment and Planning (MAP) Toolkit.  

 Evaluate target computer readiness for deployment by:  

-   Verifying target computer readiness for running the MDT scripts as described in [Verify Target Computer Readiness for Running MDT Scripts](#VerifyTargetComputerReadinessforRunningMDTScripts)  

-   Verifying that target computers have adequate software and hardware system resources as described in [Verify Adequate Target Computer Resources](#VerifyAdequateTargetComputerResources)  

-   Identifying the differences in the deployment process between 32-bit and 64-bit computers as described in [Identify Differences in 64-bit and 32-bit Deployments](#IdentifyDifferencesin64-bitand32-bitDeployments)  

###  <a name="VerifyTargetComputerReadinessforRunningMDTScripts"></a> Verify Target Computer Readiness for Running MDT Scripts  
 Before running the rest of the MDT scripts, run ZTIPrereq.vbs to ensure that the target computer meets the requirements for running the remaining MDT scripts. Script prerequisites include:  

-   Windows Script Host (WSH) version 5.6 or later installed and running  

-   Microsoft XML Core Services (MSXML) version 3.0 (any service pack level) installed and running  

    > [!NOTE]
    >  The version of MSXML must be version 3.0. MSXML versions 4.0 and 6.0 are not compatible with the MDT scripts.  

###  <a name="VerifyAdequateTargetComputerResources"></a> Verify Adequate Target Computer Resources  
 After ZTIPrereq.vbs determines that the computer meets the requirements for running the remaining scripts, ZTIValidate.wsf determines whether the target computer has the appropriate software and hardware system resources to deploy the target operating system. These requirements include:  

- The target computer has WSH 5.6 or later installed  

- In any scenario except New Computer (which does not migrate user data), the existing operating system must be a client operating system if the new operating system is a client operating system. Similarly, only a server operating system can be deployed to a computer currently running a server operating system.  

- The `OSInstall` property, if defined, must be set to `YES` for the deployment to continue  

- The target computer memory must meet the requirements of the operating system  

  > [!NOTE]
  >  The minimum recommended amount of physical memory for the target computer is 1 GB.  

- The target computer processor must meet the requirements of the operating system  

- The target computer must have sufficient available disk space for the image being deployed to it  

- The current operating system on the target computer must be running on the C partition (Refresh Computer scenario only)  

- Drive C must be the first partition on the first disk of the target computer (Refresh Computer scenario only)  

- Additional available disk space is required when user state migration data and deployment logs are stored locally on the target computer  

- The target computer must have sufficient free disk space (approximately 150 MB) to hold Windows PE log files  

- The target computer must have sufficient total disk space to hold Windows PE and the image (expanded image size plus 150 MB)  

- The target computer must have a direct network connection to Windows Deployment Services servers and deployment shares (Unsupported network connections include virtual private network [VPN] and wireless connections.)  

  > [!NOTE]
  >  Target computers that attempt to install an image over a VPN or wireless connection will not be able to connect to a deployment share after restarting in Windows PE, causing the deployment process to fail.  

  Determine whether any existing computers have inadequate system resources using Configuration Manager or another software inventory tool. Upgrade the system resources on these target computers prior to deploying Windows, if necessary.  

###  <a name="IdentifyDifferencesin64-bitand32-bitDeployments"></a> Identify Differences in 64-bit and 32-bit Deployments  
 Most functions and features found in 32-bit versions of Windows are the same in 64-bit versions of Windows. However, take the following differences into consideration when deploying 64-bit versions of Windows:  

-   For LTI deployments, the version of Windows PE must match the version of Windows being deployed. If deploying a 64-bit version of Windows, use a 64-bit version of Windows PE.  

-   Applications are installed in separate Program Files folders. On 64-bit versions of Windows, 64-bit applications are installed in the Program Files folder, and 32-bit applications are installed in the Program Files (x86) folder. Check the appropriate folder structure when looking for previously installed applications.  

-   Processor architecture discovery in Windows Deployment Services may need to be forced for 64-bit computers. Not all 64-bit computers properly report the processor type; therefore, MDT may not properly detect that the processor is a 64-bit processor. Use the following command to force Windows Deployment Services to deploy 64-bit versions:  

    ```  
    WDSUTIL /set-server /architecturediscovery:yes  
    ```  

     For more information, see the Windows Deployment Services Help files.  

-   64-bit versions of Windows PE do not run 32-bit applications. Ensure that any compiled applications used by a 64-bit version of Windows PE are 64-bit versions.  

-   64-bit versions of Windows require 64-bit device drivers. You cannot use 32-bit device drivers in 64-bit versions of Windows.  

###  <a name="PlanningPerformanceandPowerManagement"></a> Planning Performance and Power Management  
 Windows includes a number of features that help improve the performance and power utilization of computers. You can incorporate these improvements as part of the configuration settings you deploy to the target computers using MDT.  

 Review the following resources to identify performance and power-management configuration settings to include when performing your target computer deployments:

###  <a name="PlanningTargetComputerSecurity"></a> Planning Target Computer Security  
 When planning the configuration of the Windows operating systems for target computers, ensure that the target computers are deployed in compliance with the requirements in your organization. Microsoft has developed Security Solution Accelerators that can help you deploy your target computers in a secured configuration.  

 The Security Solution Accelerators include guidance and tools to help you secure Windows. For more information about deploying target computers in a secured configuration using these solution accelerators, see [Security Solution Accelerators](/previous-versions/tn-archive/cc936627(v=technet.10)).  

###  <a name="ChoosingLTIZTIorUDIDeployments"></a> Choosing LTI, ZTI, or UDI Deployments  
 LTI, ZTI, and UDI deployments use the same common set of scripts and configuration files (such as CustomSettings.ini) for deploying target computers. Table 6 compares LTI, ZTI, and UDI deployments.

 At some point in the MDT process, you must provide all the information necessary to install Windows and the applications on target computers. The question is, when do you provide this information? The more information you provide in advance, the less interaction is required during deployment.  

 Table 7 lists the advantages and disadvantages of performing fully automated deployments (using LTI, ZTI, or UDI) and partially automated deployments (using LTI or UDI).

####  <a name="ReviewGeneralKnownIssuesLimitationsandRecommendationsforMDT"></a> Review General Known Issues, Limitations, and Recommendations for MDT  
 The following are a list of known general issues, limitations, and recommendations that relate to MDT:  

- MDT supports the Windows Assessment and Deployment Kit (Windows ADK) for Windows 8.1, Windows PE version 5.0, System Center 2012 R2 Configuration Manager.  

- Language packs, applications, and device drivers that are disabled in the Deployment Workbench are not installed, unless you add them manually to the CustomSettings.ini file.  

- When you select the **Install Language Pack Offline** action, you must select language pack CAB files within subfolders of the main package.  

- When you specify IP addresses (for example, when identifying Domain Name System [DNS] and Windows Internet Naming Service [WINS] servers), they must exclude unnecessary zero prefixes, which will be misevaluated. For example, if the IP address is typed **10.010.10.1**, the Deployment Workbench evaluates it as **10.8.10.1**. To avoid this problem, enter IP addresses carefully, and do not add unnecessary zeroes.  

- When specifying a Run As account, you must specify a user who is a member of the Administrators group on the server. Otherwise, the account will not have sufficient privileges to access network connections established by administrators.  

- When creating deployment shares on computers that have 8.3 file names disabled (see the Microsoft Support article [How to Disable the 8.3 Name Creation on NTFS Partitions](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/121007/)), the Deployment Workbench fails to generate the Windows PE image. If 8.3 file names have been disabled, re-enable them by setting the **HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\FileSystem\NtfsDisable8dot3NameCreation** registry value to **0**.  

- Within a folder, avoid creating a subfolder and a file with the same name. For example, within the Files folder, you should not name a subfolder Item, and then create a file named Item.  

- When performing an upgrade, network and media deployment shares created in earlier versions of MDT must have valid shares.  

- If custom images captured by directly running ImageX (without using MDT to capture the image) do not work properly, troubleshoot the issues by capturing and adding the image using MDT to ensure that all prerequisites are configured properly. Add Setup files to the Deployment Workbench by adding a complete operating system distribution or by pointing the Deployment Wizard to the location of source files. When manually capturing images, use the Wimscript.ini file that MDT supplies in the \Distribution\tools\\*_platform* folder, where *platform* is either x86 (for 32-bit) or x64 (for 64-bit), to exclude the folders or files from the image. Also be aware of preexisting Unattend.xml files in the image. Specify the correct **/FLAGS** value when capturing Windows images using ImageX or Windows Deployment Services capture processes.  

- At the completion of MDT deployment, a summary page displays warnings about errors encountered during the process. (This page is not displayed when conducting the Server Core installation because it does not include the required Windows Internet Explorer® components.) It is possible for deployment to finish but still trigger several errors or warnings if the errors are nonfatal. It is useful to inspect these errors and warnings—for example, by opening corresponding logs files and running verification tests—and determine whether they are unexpected.  

- Some device drivers can stall the deployment process. If this happens, isolate the device driver and remove it from the target computer, or contact the vendor for an updated version of the device driver.  

- The error "Cannot Find Driver Path" can appear if you choose to optimize a Windows PE image and select drivers that are not available from the distribution point. To work around this problem, select the**Completely Regenerate The Boot Images** option.  

- The USMT fails if you enter a path surrounded by quotation marks that also ends in a backslash (\\). To prevent problems, simply leave off the final backslash when specifying a folder. For example, the following paths will cause an error:  

  - "D:\\"  

  - "D:\folder\\"  

    However, these paths will not cause an error:  

  - D:  

  - D:\  

  - D:\folder\  

  - D:\folder  

  - "D:\folder"  

  - "D:\\\"  

  - "D:"  

- Configure the Internet Explorer home page using CustomSettings.ini, in the MDT DB, or by using the Windows Internet Explorer Administration Kit (IEAK). Configuring the Internet Explorer home page works only in Windows unattended installation.  

- During LTI deployments to new computers, some pages (such as the **User Locale** and **Keyboard Locale** pages) do not display text correctly if required fonts are not installed in Windows PE. In the Refresh Computer scenario, the same symptoms appear if required fonts are not installed in the operating system being replaced.  

- Some keyboard layouts might require language packs or input method editors that MDT does not automatically include in the Windows PE startup image. MDT does not verify that the keyboard layout is valid. For more information, see [Custom Input Method Editor (IME) requirements](/windows/uwp/design/input/input-method-editor-requirements).

- A maximum of two WINS server addresses can be added when configuring static IP configuration settings for a network adapter. If more than two WINS server addresses are added using MDT, only the first two WINS server addresses are used.  

- Hash value errors may occur in Configuration Manager during download on demand or when creating a media deployment DVD. This can occur if the packages on the distribution points are inconsistent with the information in the Configuration Manager database.  

  ###### To correct hash value errors for Configuration Manager  

  1.  Click **Start**, point to **All Programs**, and then point to **Microsoft System Center 2012**. Point to **Configuration Manager**, and then click **Configuration Manager Console**.  

  2.  In the Configuration Manager console, in the **Navigation** pane, click **Software Library**.  

  3.  In the Software Library workspace, go to Overview/Application Management/Packages.  

  4.  In the preview pane, click ***package_name*** (where *package_name* is the name of the package that is inconsistent).  

  5.  On the Ribbon, on the **Home** tab, in the **Properties** group, click **Properties**.  

       The ***package_name*****Properties** dialog box opens (where *package_name* is the name of the package).  

  6.  In the ***package_name*****Properties** dialog box (where *package_name* is the name of the package), on the **Content Locations** tab, in **Distribution points or distribution point groups** box, click ***distribution_point*** (where *distribution_point* is the name of the distribution point or distribution point group), then click **Redistribute**.  

  7.  In the **Configuration Manager** dialog box, click **OK**.  

  8.  Repeat steps f through g for each distribution point or distribution point group.  

  9. In the ***package_name*****Properties** dialog box, click **OK**.  

  10. Repeat steps d through i for each package that is inconsistent.  

- In LTI deployments, you set several kinds of information in the Create Task Sequence Wizard. The UI does not provide an option to edit this information at a later time. However, you can edit the information directly in the Unattend.xml file. The information includes:  

  -   Organization name  

  -   Full name  

  -   Internet Explorer home page  

  -   Local Administrator password  

- No user state configuration settings can be or need to be specified using the CustomSettings.ini file for Configuration Manager scenarios. The network location is determined automatically by the **Request State Store** task.  

- In Configuration Manager deployments, you can install multiple application packages on a computer by specifying them in the CustomSettings.ini file according to the following parameters:  

  -   Specify a base variable named PACKAGES in the task sequence in the **Install Software** task.  

  -   Each PACKAGES variable name should have a suffix starting with *001*.  

  -   The **PACKAGESxxx** value should have the format *PACKAGEID:ProgramName* (use a colon between items).  

  -   The **ProgramName** value is case-sensitive.  

       The following is an example of specifying packages in CustomSettings.ini:  

      ```  
      PACKAGES001=DEP0002B:Install Office 2007  
      PACKAGES002=DEP00011:Install Office Communicator  

      ```  

- In LTI New Computer deployments, applications marked as hidden in the Deployment Workbench are not installed when you do not skip the Application page in the Deployment Wizard and specify the application globally unique identifier (GUID) in CustomSettings.ini. Specify hidden applications using the **MandatoryApplications** property instead of the **Applications** property.  

- Close the Configuration Manager console before running the integration option from MDT. Otherwise, some files may not be properly updated.  

- During the Scanstate and Loadstate processes, multiple copies of log files may be created. You can use a new USMT template for excluding the log files or log directories while running Scanstate and Loadstate.  

- New Computer and Replace Computer deployment scenarios format Disk 0 by default. Using MDT on computers with original equipment manufacturer (OEM) partitions or multiple fixed or external hard disks may require additional configuration and scripting in addition to thorough testing.  

- The Task Sequencer will not accept XML files that contain Unicode content (from an XML file encoded as UTF-8). Attempting to do use XML files results in a task sequence failure. The Task Sequencer does not properly deal with encoded UTF-7 data: It does not cause a failure, but it does cause the data to be translated unexpectedly.  

- After uninstalling MDT using the Control Panel Add or Remove Programs item, the Distribution share directory (if created) must be removed manually. MDT does not remove files or folders that it did not initially install.  

- When using MDT extensions (add-in wizards) with Configuration Manager, MDT must be installed on every server running Configuration Manager used to administer operating system deployments.  

- The **Priority** property in CustomSettings.ini has no maximum line length. However, if the property name is longer than 55 characters when the Configure Database Wizard runs, the wizard will truncate the **Priority** property, and you will need to manually edit the property. As a workaround, run the Configure Database Wizard before performing any other customization, or clear the check boxes for queries in the wizard that are not needed.  

- MDT supports deployment from a UFD. See the Windows ADK for information about preparing the device, then copy (using the**xcopy** command) all files and folders from the \Media\content folder to the UFD.  

- Dialing properties that are not configured, even if present in the answer file, include the country/region code, area code, long-distance access, and dialing rules. To work around this issue, configure dialing rules by creating and testing a .reg file in a lab environment, and then import that .reg file as a custom task during the task sequence.  

####  <a name="ReviewGeneralKnownIssuesLimitationsandRecommendationsThatRelatetoWindows"></a> Review Known Issues, Limitations, and Recommendations That Relate to Windows  
 The following is a list of known issues, limitations, and recommendations that relate to Windows:  

-   Deployment will fail on computers configured for a language other than English when the Windows Media® Player Network Sharing Service is run. As a workaround, stop the Windows Media Player Network Sharing Service until after deployment is complete.  

-   You can use AD DS to back up BitLocker and TPM data. Recovery information includes the recovery password for each encrypted value, the TPM owner password, and the information necessary to associate recovery information with computers and volumes. Another option is to save a package containing the keys used to encrypt data in addition to the recovery password required to access those keys. For more information, see [BitLocker FAQ for AD DS](/windows/security/information-protection/bitlocker/bitlocker-and-adds-faq) in the Microsoft Download Center.  

-   When enabling BitLocker, key files are generated as hidden, read-only system files. To see them, set the Windows Explorer option to show hidden and system files.  

-   BitLockerduring LTI deployment requires at least two partitions. The first partition is the primary partition and can be any size; it stores operating system files and user data. In BitLocker terminology, this is called the *boot partition.* For Windows 7, it should be at least 300 MB. This partition stores startup files required during the first phase of startup and is called the *system partition.* A BitLocker partition is created for all Windows 7 deployments, regardless of whether you are deploying BitLocker.  

-   If a user with a limited account maps a drive (such as drive Z) to the MDT distribution point (\\\\*server*\distribution$, where *server* is the name of the computer hosting the distribution point), runs LiteTouch.vbs, and then provides Administrator credentials in the **User Credentials** dialog box, MDT displays the error, "Cannot find script file 'Z:\Scripts\LiteTouch.wsf' because the account that the user provided in the User Credentials dialog box cannot access the mapped drive created by the limited user account." To resolve this issue, use an account with Administrator credentials to map the drive to the distribution point.  

-   BitLockerdeployment can fail with the error, "Unable to merge BDEPartition, return code=87," when the user does not specify a locale. Restarting the computer does not allow the operating system to start. To avoid this error, specify a user language, or edit the CustomSettings.ini file to specify the **UILanguage** property. For example, you could add `UILanguage = en-us` to the CustomSettings.ini file.  

-   If activating BitLocker during installation fails in Refresh Computer scenario, verify that MDT is able to shrink the partition as required by following these steps:  

    1.  At a command prompt, type **diskpart shrink querymax**, and note the value displayed.  

    2.  If the value is less than 2,000 MB, then manually defragment the disk. MDT performs an automatic defragmentation, however, so this might not resolve the problem.  

    3.  If defragmenting the disk does not resolve the issue, back up the computer's hard disk, create a new partition, and repeat these steps until typing **diskpart shrink querymax** returns a value greater than 2,000 MB. There might be files in specific areas of the partition that cannot be relocated or removed.  

-   The **BDERequired** flag is no longer used. By default, all sample templates that enable BitLocker and encounter an error will stop. You can edit the task sequence to enable deployment to continue if an error occurs.  

-   When deploying an image that is using a different language, Setup will prompt for the keyboard layout, language, and time and currency settings during the Windows PE phase. As a workaround, import Setup files with the custom image.  

-   MDT supports Windows language pack selection during deployment for all scenarios if the language packs are configured in the Deployment Workbench. Selecting multiple language packs is possible when deploying Enterprise or Ultimate editions of the operating systems. When other editions of Windows  are deployed, only one language pack can be selected because of Windows licensing restrictions.  

####  <a name="ReviewGeneralKnownIssuesLimitationsandRecommendationsThatRelatetoDisksandPartitioning"></a> Review Known Issues, Limitations, and Recommendations That Relate to Disks and Partitioning  
 The following is a list of known issues, limitations, and recommendations that relate to disk and partitioning:  

-   LTI does not support the deployment of the target operating system to logical drives or dynamic disks.  

-   Deployments to existing disk partitions created by newer operating system versions are not supported in Refresh Computer deployment scenarios.  

     However, you can deploy different processor architecture versions to the existing partitions created by the same operating system version. For example, you can deploy a 64-bit version of Windows on a computer that is currently running a 32-bit version of Windows or vice versa.  

-   In the **Format and Partition Disk** task sequence step types, always configure the logical partitions that will reside on an extended partition immediately after the extended partition. If you do not specify the logical partitions immediately after the extended partition, creating the logical partition sizes using a percentage produces unexpected results.  

     For example, the following partition creation order is incorrect, because the logical partitions (partition 4 and partition 5) are not immediately after the extended partition (partition 2):  

    ```  
    Partition 1: Primary   
    Partition 2: Extended  
    Partition 3: Primary   
    Partition 4: Logical  
    Partition 5: Logical  
    Partition 6: Primary  

    ```  

     Instead, create the partitions in the following order:  

    ```  
    Partition 1: Primary   
    Partition 2: Extended  
    Partition 3: Logical  
    Partition 4: Logical  
    Partition 5: Primary   
    Partition 6: Primary  

    ```  

-   Windows always hides the system volume during deployment, so a drive letter is not assigned to the system volume. For example, if the target computer has one drive with two partitions, Partition_1 and Partition_2, and you deploy Windows to Partition_2, Windows will be properly deployed to Partition_ 2. However, a drive letter will not be assigned to Partition_1.  

-   After starting Windows PE, the drive letters assigned to each storage device may change. For example, if the destination computer has a CD-ROM assigned to drive D and a hard disk drive assigned to drive E, the hard disk drive will be on drive D and the CD-ROM will be on drive E when Windows PE starts. If a DVD deployment fails, check that the drives have not been reassigned on the target computer. To simplify deployment, save user data to a network location instead of to a local drive.  

-   Avoid editing the Unattend.xml files to format or alter the partitions. MDT might store state and user data on the partition before calling Setup.exe (in LTI scenarios), and instructions added to Unattend.xml would cause Setup to destroy that data, resulting in a deployment failure.  

-   While configuring the **Format and Partition Disk** task, always specify the extended and logical partitions together, and do not add a primary partition in-between, which gives undesirable results when a logical partition size is configured using a percentage. In other words, do not add a primary partition between an extended and logical partition.  

####  <a name="ReviewGeneralKnownIssuesLimitationsandRecommendationsThatRelatetoBitLocker"></a> Review Known Issues, Limitations, and Recommendations That Relate to BitLocker  
 The following is a list of known issues, limitations, and recommendations that relate to BitLocker:  

- Windows Server may crash if the operating system image used to perform the deployment does not have the optional BitLocker component. This situation can occur in the following scenarios:  

  - Performing the MDT Refresh Computer deployment scenario (in LTI, ZTI, or UDI), where BitLocker is enabled on the existing operating system. In this situation, BitLocker is suspended in the existing operating system by MDT, but without the optional component in the new operating system image, Windows is unable to boot from the disk on which BitLocker is suspended.  

  - Performing the MDT New Computer deployment scenario (in LTI, ZTI, or UDI) on a Trusted Platform Module–enabled server on which BitLocker has been enabled. In this situation, BitLocker will be enabled offline using BitLocker pre-provisioning, but without the BitLocker optional component in the new operating system image, the new operating system is unable to boot from the disk on which BitLocker has been pre-provisioned.  

    The workaround for any of these situations is to deploy a custom operating system image that includes the BitLocker component in the image.  

- If you want to use an alphanumeric PIN for BitLocker during deployment, you must enable the **Allow enhanced PINs for Startup** group policy setting. The**Allow enhanced PINs for Startup** group policy setting is located in Computer Configuration/Policies/Administrative Templates/Windows Components/BitLocker Drive Encryption/Operating System Drives.  

- If a BitLocker recovery prompt appears after restarting the target computer (because the BitLocker key required to unlock the volume could not be obtained), work around the problem by using one of the following approaches:  

  -   Remove the media (such as the deployment DVD) while Windows PE is still running. Doing so prevents the operating system from seeing the DVD when it starts.  

  -   Change the boot order of the computer so that the DVD drive follows the hard disk.  

  -   Deploy the computer with no startup media; for example, use a Pre-Boot Execution Environment (PXE) deployment.  

####  <a name="ReviewKnownIssuesLimitationsandRecommendationsforLTIDeployments"></a> Review Known Issues, Limitations, and Recommendations for LTI Deployments  
 The following is a list of known issues, limitations, and recommendations that relate to LTI deployments:  

-   The network credentials specified for accessing network resources (the USMT store location, computer backup location, and so on) are not validated if a user is logged on to the computer using a domain account and if the computer already has a connection established to another share on the same server.  

####  <a name="ReviewKnownIssuesLimitationsandRecommendationsforZTIDeploymentsUsingConfigurationManager"></a> Review Known Issues, Limitations, and Recommendations for ZTI Deployments Using Configuration Manager  
 The following is a list of known issues, limitations, and recommendations that relate to ZTI deployments using Configuration Manager:  

-   When deploying a non–English-language target operating system, the installation method prompts for user language, because the template for the unattend.xml file contains settings for United States English (en-us). To work around this problem, perform one of the following tasks:  

    -   Modify the unattend.xml template file to reflect the language of the target operating system.  

    -   Configure the **KeyboardLocale**, **UserLocale**, and **UILanguage** properties in the CustomSettings.ini file or the MDT DB to reflect the language of the target operating system.  

-   When deploying computers using Configuration Manager and backing up the computer data locally, computers with two partitions may not be able to retain the backup. To prevent backups from being removed, save to a network location instead of to a local drive.  

-   In a Configuration Manager task sequence, the **Format and Partition** task might not run successfully on a computer if it has only one unformatted partition. To work around this issue, either remove the partition or format it.  

-   While installing the server roles, Configuration Manager might display a prompt for DLLs needed to complete the role installation. If this happens, specify a valid location for the required files. To avoid this step, add a step earlier in the task sequence that copies the required DLLs to the Windows Setup files folder defined in the registry. This folder location is defined in the **SourcePath** registry value, located in **HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Setup**.  

####  <a name="ReviewKnownIssuesLimitationsandRecommendationsforUDIDeployments"></a> Review Known Issues, Limitations, and Recommendations for UDI Deployments  
 The following is a list of known issues, limitations, and recommendations that relate to UDI deployments:  

-   Applications are disabled and cannot be automatically installed. This issue arises when the application requires administrator approval but has not yet been approved. If the **Require administrator approval if users request this application**check box is selected for the application, verify that the application has been approved.  

     For more information on how to require administrator approval and grant approval, see [How to Deploy Applications in Configuration Manager](../apps/deploy-use/deploy-applications.md).  

-   When performing the MDT Refresh Computer deployment scenario with a USB hard disk attached, task sequence errors may occur, because the Configuration Manager task sequencer placed the _SMSTaskSequence folder on the USB drive. By default, the  Configuration Manager task sequencer places the _SMSTaskSequence folder on the drive with the most available free disk space, which can cause problems later in the deployment process if the USB drive is removed.  

     If the _SMSTaskSequence folder is located on a USB drive, the **CheckSMSFolderOnUSB** UDI task will detect this condition and prevent the deploment from continuing. To resolve this issue and perform the deployment, complete the following steps:  

    1.  Disconnect the USB drive from the target computer before starting the task sequence.  

    2.  Start the task sequence.  

    3.  Wait until the UDI Wizard starts.  

    4.  Connect the USB drive.  

    5.  Complete the UDI Wizard.  

####  <a name="ReviewKnownIssuesLimitationsandRecommendationsforRunningTaskSequencesonTargetComputers"></a> Review Known Issues, Limitations, and Recommendations for Running Task Sequences on Target Computers  
 The following is a list of known issues, limitations, and recommendations for running task sequences on target computers in MDT:  

-   For LTI deployments, ensure that User Account Control (UAC) is disabled for the built-in local Administrator account on the target computers until the task sequence finishes. Running task sequences on computers with UAC enabled for the local Administrator account causes task sequences to fail.  

    > [!NOTE]
    >  UAC should be disabled only for the built-in local Administrator account and enabled for all other accounts. By default, the built-in local Administrator account is excluded from UAC because of the **User Account Control: Admin Approval Mode for the built-in Administrator account** (disabled) policy setting.  

     For more information about [UAC Group Policy settings, see UAC Group Policy Settings and Registry Key Settings](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dd835564\(WS.10\).aspx).  

####  <a name="ReviewKnownIssuesLimitationsandRecommendationsforSavingandRestoringUserInformation"></a> Review Known Issues, Limitations, and Recommendations for Saving and Restoring User Information  
 The following is a list of known issues, limitations, and recommendations for saving and restoring user information in MDT:  

- For LTI deployments, do not add any of the following USMT command-line parameters to the **ScanStateArgs** or **LoadStateArgs** properties, as they cause the saving and restoration of user state information to fail:  

  -   **/hardlink**  

  -   **/nocompress**  

  -   **/encrypt**  

  -   **/key**  

  -   **/keyfile**  

  -   **/vsc**  

  -   **/l**  

  -   **/I**  

- User state migration data may not be restored properly depending on the disk configuration of the target computer when deploying Windows.  

   This issue can occur when the target computer has two physical hard disks, Disk_0 and Disk_1. Disk_0 contains the C volume, which is encrypted using BitLocker. The MDT deployment process is configured to deploy a new operating system to Disk_1. The problems in the deployment process occur as follows:  

  - Early the deployment process, the minint and smstasksequence folders are copied to the existing C volume, which is encrypted.  

  - Disk_1 is partitioned and formatted properly in preparation for deploying the target operating system.  

  - The target operating system is installed on the new partition and disk volume on Disk_1.  

  - During the State Restore Phase, the original C volume is not assigned a drive letter, so the task sequence steps in the State Restore Phase cannot access the minint and smstasksequence folders on the BitLocker-encrypted drive. The restoration of the user state migration data fails.  

    The result is that the target operating system is installed, but the restoration of the user state migration data fails.  

### Overview of UDI  
 Typically, when deploying operating systems using the OSD feature in Configuration Manager and ZTI in MDT you must provide all the information necessary to deploy the operating system. Prior to performing the deployment, the information is configured in configuration files or in databases (such as the CustomSettings.ini file or the MDT DB). During the ZTI deployment process, ZTI converts the appropriate configuration settings to task sequence variables, which are consumed by the MDT task sequences for UDI. All of the configuration settings must be provided before you can initiate the deployment.  

 UDI provides a wizard driven interface that allows users to provide configuration information immediately prior to the deployment being performed. You can configure the user experience in the wizard, which lets you control the amount information the user completing the wizard must provide. This division of user roles allows IT pros to provide precise control over deployments while reducing the load on them by allowing other users to perform the deployments. The interface allows you to create generic OSD task sequences, and then provide computer specific information at the time of deployment, which provides greater flexibility in the deployment process.  

> [!NOTE]
>  If you are unfamiliar with UDI, review the UDI terms and terminology in "UDI Concepts" in the *Microsoft Deployment Toolkit Reference*. Familiarizing yourself with these terms and terminology will help you be more successful in applying the remainder of this guide to your organization.  

##  <a name="InstallingorUpgradingtoMDT"></a> Installing or Upgrading to MDT  
 To prepare for performing deployments using MDT, perform the following tasks:  

1.  Review the known issues, limitations, and recommendations for preparing disks on target computers in MDT as described in [Reviewing Known Issues, Limitations, and Recommendations for Installing or Upgrading to MDT](#ReviewingKnownIssuesLimitationsandRecommendationsforInstallingorUpgradingtoMDT).  

2.  Prepare the prerequisite infrastructure required for the LTI, ZTI, and UDI deployments methods as described in [Preparing the Prerequisite Infrastructure for All MDT Deployment Methods](#PreparingthePrerequisiteInfrastructureforAllMDTDeploymentMethods).  

3.  Perform any combination of the following steps to ensure that MDT is installed correctly:  

    -   Install a new instance of MDT on each computer where you want to manage MDT deployment shares as described in [Installing a New Instance of MDT](#InstallingaNewInstanceofMDT).  

    -   Upgrade an existing instance of MDT 2012 Update 1 as described in [Upgrading to MDT](#UpgradingtoMDT).  

4.  Determine whether any updates are available for the components in the Deployment Workbench using the Check Updates Wizard as described in [Upgrading to MDT](#UpgradingtoMDT).  

> [!NOTE]
>  Windows PowerShell™ version 2.0 or later must be installed on any computer on which MDT is installed for management of LTI or ZTI deployments.  

###  <a name="ReviewingKnownIssuesLimitationsandRecommendationsforInstallingorUpgradingtoMDT"></a> Reviewing Known Issues, Limitations, and Recommendations for Installing or Upgrading to MDT  
 The following is a list of known issues, limitations, and recommendations for installing MDT:  

- Ensure that the disk volume that contains the temporary folder that the Deployment Workbench uses has at least 20 GB of available disk space.  

   The Deployment Workbench creates large images and requires temporary storage during the image-creation process. The Deployment Workbench determines the temporary folder to use by performing the following steps:  

  1. Use the temporary folder specified in the **Temp_Dir** registry subkey, which is located at **HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Deployment 4**. Create the **Temp_Dir** registry subkey as a **REG_SZ** type that contains the fully qualified path to the folder to be used as the temporary folder.  

  2. If the **TEMP_DIR** registry subkey does not exist, then the Deployment Workbench uses the folder specified in the %TEMP% environment variable.  

     Ensure that the disk volume specified in the **TEMP_DIR** registry subkey or in the %TEMP% environment variable has sufficient available disk space.  

###  <a name="PreparingthePrerequisiteInfrastructureforAllMDTDeploymentMethods"></a> Preparing the Prerequisite Infrastructure for All MDT Deployment Methods

4.  Obtain the software that the LTI deployment process requires as described in [Obtain the Software That the LTI Deployment Process Requires](#ObtaintheSoftwareThattheLTIDeploymentProcessRequiresh).  

####  <a name="PreparethePrerequisiteLTIInfrastructure"></a> Prepare the Prerequisite LTI Infrastructure  
 LTI deployments require that a properly configured infrastructure exist prior to installing MDT and performing deployments. Ensure that your new or existing infrastructure is specifically optimized for the operating system deployments.  

> [!NOTE]
>  Windows PowerShell version 2.0 or later must be installed on any computer on which MDT is installed for management of LTI deployments.  

 For more information about configuring your environment to support LTI deployments, see the following sections in the MDT document *Quick Start Guide for Lite Touch Installation*:  

-   "Prerequisites"  

-   "Step 1: Obtain the Required Software"  

####  <a name="InstallorUpgradetoMDTforLTIDeployments"></a> Install or Upgrade to MDT for LTI Deployments  
 To perform LTI deployments, you must have at least one instance of MDT running in your environment. If your existing environment has:  

-   No computers currently running MDT or a previous version of MDT, then install one or more new instances of MDT as described in [Installing a New Instance of MDT](#InstallingaNewInstanceofMDT)  

-   One or more computers running a previous version of MDT, then upgrade those instances to MDT as described in [Upgrading to MDT](#UpgradingtoMDT).  

####  <a name="InstallComponentsThatMDTandLTIRequire"></a> Install Components That MDT and LTI Require  
 The Deployment Workbench is the administration console for LTI. Most of the LTI management tasks are performed in the Deployment Workbench. MDT also includes a Windows PowerShell provider that allows for the automation of LTI management tasks through the Windows PowerShell command shell using MDT cmdlets.  

> [!NOTE]
>  MDT supports Windows ADK for Windows 8.1, Windows PE 5.0, and System Center 2012 R2 Configuration Manager.  

Table 10 lists the top-level nodes in the Deployment Workbench and the types of tasks performed in each node.  

### Table 10. Deployment Workbench Nodes  

|**Node** |**Description** |  
|--------------|---------------------|  
|**Information Center** |Provides access to documentation, displays breaking news about MDT, and lists the components required to use the Deployment Workbench.|  
|**Deployment Shares** |Lists the deployment shares that this instance of the Deployment Workbench manages. Each deployment share includes operating systems, applications, operating system packages, task sequences, and out-of-box drivers populated in the deployment share.|  

 The Deployment Workbench automates the download and installation of components used in LTI.  

> [!NOTE]
>  If the MDT computer has internet connectivity, the Deployment Workbench can automatically download the components.  

###### To download and install Deployment Workbench components  

1. Click **Start**, and then point to **All Programs**. Point to **Microsoft Deployment Toolkit**, and then click **Deployment Workbench**.  

2. In the Deployment Workbench console tree, go to Deployment Workbench/Information Center/Components.  

3. In the Components pane, in the **Available for Download** section, click **component_name** (where *component_name* is the name of the component you want to download).  

4. In the details pane, click **Download**.  

    After downloading the component from the internet, the component is listed in the **Downloaded** section in the details pane.  

5. In the details pane, in the **Download** section, click the downloaded component, and then click **Install**.  

   > [!NOTE]
   >  If there is no **Install** button, the component cannot be installed or the installation is not necessary.  

    The installation process for the respective component is initiated. Complete the installation process for the component using the instructions provided for the component.  

    After the component is installed, the component appears in the **Installed** section of the details pane. If the component cannot be installed or you did not choose to install it, the component remains in the **Downloaded** section.  

   MDT uses the Windows ADK for Windows 8.1 which includes USMT.  

####  <a name="ObtaintheSoftwareThattheLTIDeploymentProcessRequiresh"></a> Obtain the Software That the LTI Deployment Process Requires  
 Collect the software that LTI will deploy. LTI will import or add this software to deployment shares. The software that can be deployed includes:  

- Operating system source files or image files for each operating system to be deployed to the reference and target computers  

- Operating system packages for the operating systems, such as security updates, feature packs, or language packs  

- Device drivers for the reference and target computers that are not included as a part of the operating system  

- Applications that are to be installed as a part of the operating system image or during the deployment of the reference image  

  The Task Sequencer used in MDT deployments requires that the Create Global Object right be assigned to credentials used to access and run the Deployment Workbench and the deployment process. This right is typically available to accounts with Administrator-level permissions (unless explicitly removed). Also, the Specialized Security – Limited Functionality (SSLF) security profile, which is part of the Windows security baselines, removes the Create Global Object right and should not be applied to computers being deployed using MDT.  

  In addition, LTI requires that the:  

- Local Administrator account on the target computer be enabled  

- Local Administrator account be granted the Create Global Objects right  

- Local Administrator account not have UAC enabled  

- Ability to have an account automatically log on to the target computer be enabled and not blocked using Group Policy or a local security policy  

- Logon banner for the target computers not be enabled using Group Policy or a local security policy  

###  <a name="PreparingforLTIDeploymenttotheReferenceComputer"></a> Preparing for LTI Deployment to the Reference Computer  
 For many of the LTI deployment scenarios, best practice is to create a reference computer as described in [Choosing Thick, Thin, or Hybrid Images](#ChoosingThickThinorHybridImages), and then capture an image of that computer. Later in the LTI deployment process, you will deploy the captured image of your reference computer to the appropriate target computers.  

> [!NOTE]
>  In some LTI deployment scenarios, you may want to deploy Windows operating systems without creating a reference image—for example, when you want to deploy thin images. If you are deploying thin images and you do not want to create a reference image, skip the steps that relate to the reference computer. For more information about determining which image type to use, see [Choosing Thick, Thin, or Hybrid Images](#ChoosingThickThinorHybridImages).  

 Create a reference computer for each image you want to create for deployment to the target computers. For more information about determining the number of images required in your organization and subsequently the number of reference computers required, see [Estimate Storage Requirements for MDT Deployment Shares](#EstimateStorageRequirementsforMDTDeploymentShares).  

 For more information about the use of reference computers in MDT-based deployments, see [Using Reference Computers in MDT Deployments](#UsingReferenceComputersinMDTDeployments).  

##### To prepare for deployment to the reference computer  

1. Create a new deployment share, or upgrade an existing deployment share.For more information about:  

   -   Creating a new deployment share, see [Create a New Deployment Share in the Deployment Workbench](#CreateaNewDeploymentShareintheDeploymentWorkbench)  

   -   Upgrading an existing deployment share, see [Upgrade an Existing Deployment Share in the Deployment Workbench](#UpgradeanExistingDeploymentShareintheDeploymentWorkbench)  

2. Configure the deployment share to contain the appropriate software for deployment to the reference computer, including the following:  

   -   Configuring operating systems as described in [Configuring Operating Systems in the Deployment Workbench](#ConfiguringOperatingSystemsintheDeploymentWorkbench)  

   -   Configuring applications as described in [View and Configure an Application in the Deployment Workbench](#ViewandConfigureanApplicationintheDeploymentWorkbench)  

   -   Configuring operating system packages as described in [Configuring Packages in the Deployment Workbench](#ConfiguringPackagesintheDeploymentWorkbench)  

   -   Configuring device drivers as described in [Configuring Device Drivers in the Deployment Workbench](#ConfiguringDeviceDriversintheDeploymentWorkbench)  

3. Create a new task sequence that will deploy the target operating system to the reference computer as described in:  

   - [Configuring Task Sequences in the Deployment Workbench](#ConfiguringTaskSequencesintheDeploymentWorkbench)  

   - [Configuring LTI Task Sequence Steps in the Deployment Workbench](#ConfiguringLTITaskSequenceStepsintheDeploymentWorkbench)  

     The LTI deployment process is unable to perform Sysprep operations on a target computer that is encrypted using BitLocker. Ensure that you do not enable BitLocker on the reference computer. Enable BitLocker on the target computers only after the target operating system is completely deployed.  

   > [!TIP]
   >  Create the task sequence for deploying to the reference computer based on the Standard Client Task Sequence template, included in MDT.  

4. Customize the MDT configuration files to the needs of your organization as described in [Configuring MDT Deployments](#ConfiguringMDTDeployments).  

5. Configure any Windows PE options for the deployment share as described in:  

   -   [Configure the Deployment Share Properties Windows PE x86 Settings Tab](#ConfiguretheDeploymentSharePropertiesWindowsPEx86SettingsTab)  

   -   [Configure the Deployment Share Properties Windows PE x86 Components Tab](#ConfiguretheDeploymentSharePropertiesWindowsPEx86ComponentsTab)  

   -   [Configure the Deployment Share Properties Windows PE x64 Settings Tab](#ConfiguretheDeploymentSharePropertiesWindowsPEx64SettingsTab)  

   -   [Configure the Deployment Share Properties Windows PE x64 Components Tab](#ConfiguretheDeploymentSharePropertiesWindowsPEx64ComponentsTab)  

6. Update the deployment share to create the Windows PE images used to start LTI deployment as described in [Update a Deployment Share in the Deployment Workbench](#UpdateaDeploymentShareintheDeploymentWorkbench).  

###  <a name="DeployingToandCapturinganImageoftheReferenceComputerinLTI"></a> Deploying To and Capturing an Image of the Reference Computer in LTI  
 After you have configured the deployment share, updated the deployment share, and created the Windows PE images that include the LTI scripts, start the reference computer with the Windows PE image, and complete the Deployment Wizard. The task sequence you created earlier in the process will deploy the target operating system, device drivers, operating system packages, and applications to the reference computer, and then capture an image of the reference computer.  

##### To deploy to and capture an image of the reference computer  

1.  Create the LTI bootable media used to start the reference computer as described in [Create the LTI Bootable Media](#CreatetheLTIBootableMedia).  

2.  Complete the Deployment Wizard to deploy and capture an image of the reference computer as described in [Complete the Deployment Wizard](#CompletetheDeploymentWizard).  

3.  Add the captured reference computer image to the Operating Systems node in the Deployment Workbench as described in [Add the Captured Image of the Reference Computer to the Deployment Workbench](#AddtheCapturedImageoftheReferenceComputertotheDeploymentWorkbench).  

####  <a name="CreatetheLTIBootableMedia"></a> Create the LTI Bootable Media  
 You must provide a method for starting the computer with the customized version of Windows PE you created when you updated the deployment share. The Deployment Workbench creates the LiteTouchPE_x86.iso and LiteTouchPE_x86.wim files (for 32-bit target computers) or the LiteTouchPE_x64.iso and LiteTouchPE_x64.wim files (for 64-bit target computers) in the *deployment_share*\Boot folder (where *deployment_share* is the network shared folder used as the deployment share). Create the appropriate LTI bootable media from one of these images.  

###### To create the LTI bootable media  

1.  In Windows Explorer, go to *deployment_share*\Boot (where *deployment_share* is the network shared folder used as the deployment share).  

    > [!TIP]
    >  To determine the location of the deployment share, view the properties of the share in the Deployment Workbench.  

2.  Based on the type of computer used for the reference computer, perform one of the following tasks:  

    -   If the reference computer is a physical computer, create a UFD, CD, or DVD of the ISO file.  

    -   If the reference computer is a VM, start the VM directly from the ISO file or from a CD or DVD of the ISO file.  

####  <a name="CompletetheDeploymentWizard"></a> Complete the Deployment Wizard  
 Start the reference computer with the LTI bootable media you created earlier in the process. The LTI bootable media starts Windows PE on the reference computer and initiates the deployment process. At the end of the process, the target operating system is deployed on the reference computer, and an image of the reference computer is captured.  

> [!NOTE]
>  You could also initiate the process by starting the target computer from Windows Deployment Services. For more information, see [Preparing Windows Deployment Services for LTI Deployments](#PreparingWindowsDeploymentServicesforLTIDeployments).  

###### To complete the Deployment Wizard  

1. Start the reference computer with the LTI bootable media you created earlier in the process.  

    Windows PE starts, and then the Deployment Wizard starts.  

2. Complete the Deployment Wizard as described in [Running the Deployment Wizard](#RunningtheDeploymentWizard), ensuring that you specifically follow the configuration settings on the wizard pages listed in Table 11 and selecting the values on the other wizard pages appropriate to your organization.  

   ### Table 11. Information for Completing the Deployment Wizard

   |**On this wizard page** |**Do this** |  
   |-----------------------------|-----------------|  
   |**Options** |a. Select one of the following options based on your requirements:<br /><br /> **- Optimize the boot image updating process**. This option configures the Update Deployment Share Wizard to update existing versions of the image files. Select this option when you want to reduce the amount of time required to update the boot images. Typically, this process takes less time than the **Completely regenerate the boot images** option.<br /><br /> You can optionally select the **Compress the boot image contents to recover space used by removed or modified content** check box to reduce the size of the boot images. Over time, the process of adding and removing content (such as drivers, components, and packages) can increase the size of the Windows PE image. Selecting this option reduces the image size to the minimum for the current content. However, it may also increase the time required to generate the images.<br /><br /> **- Completely regenerate the boot images**. This option configures the Update Deployment Share Wizard to create a new version of all the image files. Select this option when you want to force the creation of new images. This process can take longer than the **Optimize the boot image updating process** option.<br /><br /> By default, the **Optimize the boot image updating process** option is selected and the **Compress the boot image contents to recover space used by removed or modified content** check box is cleared.<br /><br /> b.

> [!NOTE]
>  Optionally, create a bootable device, such as a UFD or USB hard disk, from the ISO file so that you can start the target computer from the device as described in [Create Bootable Devices from MDT Boot Images](#CreateBootableDevicesfromMDTBootImages).  

####  <a name="CreateBootableDevicesfromMDTBootImages"></a> Create Bootable Devices from MDT Boot Images  
 Starting destination computers using a bootable device (such as a UFD or a USB hard disk) is often quicker and easier than starting computers using Windows Deployment Services or CDs.  

> [!NOTE]
>  The target computer must support booting from the device to use this method of starting target computers.  

###### To create a bootable UFD  

1.  On a computer running Windows 7 or later operating system, insert the UFD or USB hard disk.  

2.  Run **Diskpart.exe**, and type the command **list disk** to determine the disk number associated with the device.  

3.  Input the following commands, where N is the disk number identified in the previous step:  

    -   **select disk N**  

    -   **clean**  

    -   **create partition primary**  

    -   **select partition 1**  

    -   **active**  

    -   **format fs=fat32**  

    -   **assign**  

    -   **exit**  

4.  Copy the contents of LiteTouchPE_x86.iso (for 32-bit target computers) or LiteTouchPE_x64.iso (for 64-bit target computers) to the device by performing one of the following tasks:  

    -   Burn the ISO file to a CD, and then copy its contents to the device using the command:  

        ```  
        xcopy <d>:\*.* <e>:\*.* /s /e /f  
        ```  

         Where *d* is the driver letter of the CD and *e* is the drive letter of the device.  

    -   Alternatively, mount the ISO file using a virtual CD program, and then copy its contents to the device using the command:  

        ```  
        xcopy <d>:\*.* <e>:\*.* /s /e /f  
        ```  

         where *d* is the driver letter of the CD and *e* is the drive letter of the device.

####  <a name="CreateaNewApplicationintheDeploymentWorkbench"></a> Create a New Application in the Deployment Workbench  
 You can create new applications in the Deployment Workbench using one of the options listed in Table 36. You import operating systems into the Deployment Workbench using the New Application Wizard.  

### Table 36. Options for Creating a New Application  

|**Option** |**Select this option to create an application when** |  
|----------------|----------------------------------------------------------|  
|Application with source files|The application source files are not available to the destination computer when installing the operating system build or when they must be customized. When you select this option, the application files are copied to the deployment share, and the deployment process installs the application from the deployment share.|  
|Application without source files or elsewhere on the network|The application source files are available during installation of the operating system build or to run a command that requires no application source files. When you select this option, no application source files are copied to the deployment share. Instead, the deployment process installs the application from another location on the network.|  
|Application bundle|A list of applications that you must install in a particular order. This list is specified as dependencies for the application bundle, but the bundle itself does not install anything.|  

 Start the New Application Wizard using one of the following methods:  

- In the Deployment Workbench console tree, click the Applications node or a folder beneath the Applications node. Then, in the Actions pane, click **New Application**.

 Restart the target computer after installing an application by selecting the **Restart the computer after installing this application** check box on the **Details** tab of the application **Properties** dialog box. Selecting this check box causes the Deployment Wizard to restart the target computer after installing the application, and then continue with the next step in the task sequence.  

> [!CAUTION]
>  Do not allow the application to restart the target computer. MDT must control restarts, or the task sequence will fail. For example, use the command **REBOOT=REALLYSUPPRESS** to prevent some Windows Installer–based applications from restarting. To prevent Microsoft Office from restarting the computer, add the property **SETUP_REBOOT=NEVER** to the Config.xml file or the MST file created by using the Office Customization Tool.  

 For more information on how to configure MDT to restart the target computer after installing an application, see [Configure the Application Properties Details Tab](#ConfiguretheApplicationPropertiesDetailsTab).  

####  <a name="CustomizeApplicationInstallationinTaskSequences"></a> Customize Application Installation in Task Sequences  
 Adding applications in the Applications node in a deployment share through the Deployment Workbench is the simplest method of deploying most applications. MDT task sequences deploy applications by using the **Install Application** task sequence type. Some of task sequence templates included in MDT have the **Install Applications** task sequence step in the **State Restore** group, which is based on the **Install Application** task sequence type.  

 The **Install Application** task sequence type allows for installation of one or more applications in a single task sequence step using one of the configuration options listed in Table 44.  

### Table 44. Configuration Settings on the Properties Tab of the Install Application Task Sequence  

|**Setting** |**Description** |  
|-----------------|---------------------|

#####  <a name="CreateaNewTaskSequenceStepforInstallingApplications"></a> Create a New Task Sequence Step for Installing Applications  
 In most instances, the existing **Install Applications** task sequence step is sufficient for installing applications to target computers. However, there are instances in which the existing **Install Applications** task sequence step may not be sufficient for your organization's requirements, or you may need to install an application at a different sequence in the task sequence.  

 For example, the installation process for some device drivers is performed more like an application installation than the typical installation process for a traditional device driver. You can install these device drivers by creating a new task sequence step based on the **Install Application** task sequence type.  

> [!TIP]
>  Disable the existing **Install Applications** step in the task sequence, and add all applications manually using the task sequence controls. The benefits of this approach are that you can easily select and insert applications into the task sequence in any order necessary, simplifying management of a large number of applications.  

###### To create a new task sequence step for installing applications  

1.  Create a new task sequences step based on the **Install Application** type at the appropriate place in the task sequence hierarchy as described in [Configure the Task Sequence Properties Task Sequence Tab](#ConfiguretheTaskSequencePropertiesTaskSequenceTab).  

2.  Configure the new task sequence step to deploy one or more applications as described in [Configure an Existing Install Applications Task Sequence Step](#ConfigureanExistingInstallApplicationsTaskSequenceStep).

####  <a name="CustomizePackageInstallationinTaskSequences"></a> Customize Package Installation in Task Sequences  
 Adding packages in a deployment share's Packages node through the Deployment Workbench is the simplest method for deploying most packages. MDT task sequences deploy packages using the **Install Updates Offline** task sequence type. Some of task sequence templates included in MDT have the **Apply Patches** task sequence step in the **Preinstall/Refresh only**group, which is based on the **Install Updates Offline** task sequence type.  

 The **Install Updates Offline** task sequence type allows you to install one or more packages in a single task sequence step using selection profiles, which allow one or more packages to be selected and deployed as a unit. For more information managing selection profiles, see [Manage Selection Profiles](#ManageSelectionProfiles).  

 Customize the package deployment process in your task sequences by:  

-   Configuring the existing **Apply Patches** task sequence step in the **Preinstall** group as described in [Configure an Existing Apply Patches Task Sequence Step](#ConfigureanExistingApplyPatchesTaskSequenceStep)  

-   Creating a new task sequence step based on the **Install Updates Offline** task sequence type as described in [Create a New Task Sequence Step for Installing Packages](#CreateaNewTaskSequenceStepforInstallingPackages)  

-   Adding language packs to task sequence steps as described in [Add Language Packs to Task Sequence Steps](#AddLanguagePackstoTaskSequenceSteps)  

#####  <a name="ConfigureanExistingApplyPatchesTaskSequenceStep"></a> Configure an Existing Apply Patches Task Sequence Step  
 You configure an existing **Apply Patches** task sequence step by modifying the configuration settings on the **Properties** tab of the task sequence step.  

###### To configure an existing Apply Patches task sequence step  

1. Click **Start**, and then point to **All Programs**. Point to **Microsoft Deployment Toolkit**, and then click **Deployment Workbench**.  

2. In the Deployment Workbench console tree, go to Deployment Workbench/Deployment Shares/*deployment_share*/Task Sequences (where *deployment_share* is the name of the deployment share to which you will add the application).  

3. In the details pane, click ***task_sequence*** (where *task_sequence* is the name of the task sequence you want to configure).  

4. In the Actions pane, click **Properties**.

5. In the ***task_sequence*** **Properties** dialog box, click the **Task Sequence** tab (where *task_sequence* is the name of the application you want to configure).  

6. In the hierarchy of the task sequence, go to Preinstall/Apply Patches.  

7. On the **Properties** tab, configure the settings listed in Table 48 based on the requirements of your organization, and then click **OK**.  

   ### Table 48. Configuration Settings on the Properties Tab of the Install Applications Task Sequence Step  

   |**Setting** |**Description** |  
   |-----------------|---------------------|  
   |**Name** |Configures the name of the task sequence step displayed in the task sequence hierarchy.|  
   |**Description** |Configures the description text for the task sequence step.|  
   |**Selection profile** |Used to select the selection profile that contains the updates you want to deploy in this task sequence step. The selection profile can contain one or more packages to be deployed.|  

   The updated task sequence appears in the details pane of the Deployment Workbench.  

#####  <a name="CreateaNewTaskSequenceStepforInstallingPackages"></a> Create a New Task Sequence Step for Installing Packages  
 In most instances, the existing **Apply Patches** task sequence step is sufficient for installing packages to target computers. However, there are instances in which the existing **Apply Patches** task sequence step may not be sufficient for your requirements or you may need to install a package at a different place in the task sequence.  

 For example, the packages may need to be installed in a specific order or may have dependencies, such as installing a service pack before installing hotfixes. First, create folders and selection profiles for each grouping of packages that you wanted to install separately. Then, install the groups of packages by creating a new task sequence step for each group based on the **Install Updates Offline**–type task sequence step.  

> [!TIP]
>  You can disable the existing **Apply Patches** step in the task sequence and add all packages manually using the task sequence controls. The benefit of this approach is that you easily select and insert packages into the task sequence in any order necessary. This simplifies management of a large number of packages.  

###### To create a new task sequence step for installing packages  

1.  Create a new task sequences step based on the **Install Updates Offline** type at the appropriate place in the task sequence hierarchy as described in [Configure the Task Sequence Properties Task Sequence Tab](#ConfiguretheTaskSequencePropertiesTaskSequenceTab).  

2.  Configure the new task sequence step to deploy one or more packages by selecting the appropriate selection profile containing the packages to be installed as described in [Configure an Existing Install Applications Task Sequence Step](#ConfigureanExistingInstallApplicationsTaskSequenceStep).  

#####  <a name="AddLanguagePackstoTaskSequenceSteps"></a> Add Language Packs to Task Sequence Steps  
 Language packs are one of the types of packages available in MDT and enable a multilingual Windows environment. Windows is now language neutral, and all language and locale resources are added to Windows through language packs (Lp.cab files). By adding one or more language packs to Windows those languages can be enabled when installing the operating system. As a result, the same Windows image can be deployed to regions with different language and locale settings, reducing development and deployment time.  

 See the following references for additional information about language packs in Windows:  

-   For instructions on installing language packs during deployment, see [Running the Deployment Wizard](#RunningtheDeploymentWizard).  

-   For the configuration properties for installing language packs automatically, see the MDT document *Toolkit Reference*.  

-   For more information about Windows language packs, see "Manage Language Packs for Windows" in the Windows ADK.

   |**Comments** |Provides information about the selection profile.|  
   |**Folders** |Hierarchical list of the folders and their selection status.|  

   The selection profile configuration settings are saved, the modifications are displayed in the details pane of the Deployment Workbench, and the *deployment_share*\Control\SelectionProfiles.xml file (where *deployment_share* is the name of the deployment share) is updated with the selection profile configuration settings.  

#####  <a name="CopyaSelectionProfileintheDeploymentWorkbench"></a> Copy a Selection Profile in the Deployment Workbench  
 You can copy and paste selection profiles in the Deployment Workbench using the **Copy** and **Paste** actions as described in [Copy Items in the Deployment Workbench](#CopyItemsintheDeploymentWorkbench).  

#####  <a name="MoveaSelectionProfileintheDeploymentWorkbench"></a> Move a Selection Profile in the Deployment Workbench  
 You can move selection profiles in the Deployment Workbench using the **Cut** and **Paste** actions as described in [Move Items in the Deployment Workbench](#MoveItemsintheDeploymentWorkbench).  

#####  <a name="RenameaSelectionProfileintheDeploymentWorkbench"></a> Rename a Selection Profile in the Deployment Workbench  
 You can rename selection profiles in the Deployment Workbench using the **Rename** action as described in [Rename Items in the Deployment Workbench](#RenameItemsintheDeploymentWorkbench).  

#####  <a name="DeleteaSelectionProfilefromtheDeploymentWorkbench"></a> Delete a Selection Profile from the Deployment Workbench  
 You can delete a selection profile in the Deployment Workbench using the Delete Selected Items Wizard as described in [Delete Items from the Deployment Workbench](#DeleteItemsfromtheDeploymentWorkbench). The Delete Selected Items Wizard allows you to delete individual selection profiles.  

#####  <a name="IdentifytheRelationshipBetweenSelectionProfilesandGroups"></a> Identify the Relationship Between Selection Profiles and Groups  
 Use selection profiles to create groups of Deployment Workbench items, such as operating systems, device drivers, or applications. Use the selection profiles to specify device drivers, define content to include in a linked deployment share, define the content to include for media deployments, and other tasks.  

 The relationship between items and folders in a selection profile is stored in the following files in the *deployment_share*\Control folder (where *deployment_share* is the location of the deployment share):  

- **itemGroups.xml**. There is a separate file for each type of item, including:  

  - ApplicationGroups.xml  

  - DriverGroups.xml  

  - LinkedDeploymentShareGroups.xml  

  - MediaGroups.xml  

  - OperatingSystemGroups.xml  

  - PackageGroups.xml  

  - SelectionProfileGroups.xml  

  - TaskSequenceGroups.xml  

    For example, consider a selection profile for device drivers called *WinPEAndFullOS* that are stored in a folder created immediately beneath the Out-of-Box Drivers node. The following code is an excerpt from the DriverGroups.xml file generated when you created the selection profile:  

  ```  
  <groups>  
  ...
   <group_quid="{e5143c1c-24e4-466d-9b56-b0db693c8619}" enable="True">  
     <Name>WinPEAndFullOS</Name>  
  ...
     <Member>{1eca45a5-d7ef-475a-bb0d-7f7747f16b3a}</Member>  
  ```  

- **SelectionProfiles.xml**. This file contains the definitions for all the selection profiles defined for the deployment share. The following code is an excerpt from the SelectionProfile.xml file generated when you created the WinPEAndFullOS selection profile:  

  ```  
  <selectionProfile quid="{46a3e6a2-694c-4c2f-afd8-a2986e6e252e}" enable="True">  
    <Name>Drivers Safe For WinPE</Name>  
    <Comments>Include Driver packages safe for WinPE.</Comments>  
    <ReadOnly>True</ReadOnly>  
    <Definition><SelectionProfile><Include path="Out-of-Box Drivers\WinPEAndFullOS" /><Include path="Out-of-Box Drivers\WinPEOnly" /></SelectionProfile></Definition>  
  </selectionProfile>  
  ```  

  By default, if you do not specify a selection profile or group in the CustomSettings.ini file or in the MDT DB, LTI uses all items. If you specify both selection profiles and groups in the CustomSettings.ini file or the MDT DB, LTI uses all the items from both the selection profile and the group.  

  For example, if you specify a selection profile and use the default group (which includes all items), the end result is that LTI uses all items, because the default group includes all items, regardless of what you specify in the selection profile. To restrict the items to a selection profile, specify a group that contains no items (that is, is empty). The reverse is true if you want to use a group.  

  Because of the introduction of folders in MDT, groups include all folders and subfolders by default. You can override this behavior using the **SkipGroupSubFolders**property. For more information on this property, see the corresponding section in the MDT document *Toolkit Reference*.  

  In most instances, you can use selection profiles and groups to perform most deployments. However, the following properties are available for more advanced scenarios—such as if you want to exclude a parent folder but include a child folder:  

- **CustomDriverSelectionProfile**  

- **CustomPackageSelectionProfile**  

- **CustomWizardSelectionProfile**  

   For more information on these properties, see the corresponding sections in the MDT document *Toolkit Reference*.  

####  <a name="ManageLinkedDeploymentShares"></a> Manage Linked Deployment Shares  
 Linked deployment shares in MDT allow you to provide a logical connection between two deployment shares: a source and a target deployment share. A selection profile determines the items to be linked. When creating the link between the deployment shares, you can choose whether to merge or replace content in the target deployment share.  

 Using linked deployment shares, you can easily replicate an entire deployment share or portions of a deployment share to another deployment share. In this way, you can make changes to one deployment share, and then easily update other deployment shares based on the selection profiles you chose when creating the linked deployment shares.  

 Manage linked deployment shares by performing the following tasks in the Deployment Workbench:  

- Create a new linked deployment share as described in [Create a New Linked Deployment Share in the Deployment Workbench](#CreateaNewLinkedDeploymentShareintheDeploymentWorkbench).  

- Modify an existing linked deployment share as described in [Modify an Existing Linked Deployment Share in the Deployment Workbench](#ModifyanExistingLinkedDeploymentShareintheDeploymentWorkbench).  

- Copy a linked deployment share as described in [Copy a Linked Deployment Share in the Deployment Workbench](#CopyaLinkedDeploymentShareintheDeploymentWorkbench).  

- Move a linked deployment share as described in [Move a Linked Deployment Share in the Deployment Workbench](#MoveaLinkedDeploymentShareintheDeploymentWorkbench).  

- Rename a linked deployment share as described in [Rename a Linked Deployment Share in the Deployment Workbench](#RenameaLinkedDeploymentShareintheDeploymentWorkbench).  

- Delete a linked deployment share as described in [Delete a Linked Deployment Share from the Deployment Workbench](#DeleteaLinkedDeploymentSharefromtheDeploymentWorkbench).  

- Replicate linked deployment shares as described in [Replicate Linked Deployment Shares in the Deployment Workbench](#ReplicateLinkedDeploymentSharesintheDeploymentWorkbench).  

  In addtion to managing linked deployement shares in the Deployment Workbench, you can manage linked deployment shares using the MDT Windows PowerShell cmdlets.

 The Replicate to Linked Deployments Share wizard finishes. The folders and the content you specified in the selection profile in the linked deployment share are replicated from the source deployment share to the target deployment share. Depending on the configuration of the linked deployment share, the folders and content on the target deployment share are merged or replaced.  

####  <a name="ManageLTIDeploymentMedia"></a> Manage LTI Deployment Media  
 Media in LTI allows you to perform LTI deployments solely from local media, without connecting to a deployment share. You can store the media on a DVD, USB hard disk, or other portable device. After you create the media, generate bootable WIM images that allow the deployment to be performed from portable media devices locally available on the target computer.  

 You determine the items to be included on the media in a selection profile you specify when you create the media. The Deployment Workbench automatically includes Windows PE in the media WIM image so that Windows PE is started from the media available to the target computer. When Windows PE starts, the Deployment Wizard is automatically started, as well.  

 Manage deployment media by performing the following tasks in the Deployment Workbench:  

- Create new deployment media as described in [Create New Deployment Media in the Deployment Workbench](#CreateNewDeploymentMediaintheDeploymentWorkbench).  

- Modify existing media as described in [Modify Existing Media in the Deployment Workbench](#ModifyExistingMediaintheDeploymentWorkbench).

#####  <a name="GenerateMediaImagesintheDeploymentWorkbench"></a> Generate Media Images in the Deployment Workbench  
 You can generate media images of the media content in the Deployment Workbench using the Update Media Content Wizard. The Update Media Content Wizard creates WIM file images of the media content that you can use to perform stand-alone LTI deployments from media. Ensure that sufficient storage exists for the folder containing the media content prior to running the Update Media Content Wizard, as the wizard does not verify that sufficient storage exists prior to generating the media content.  

> [!NOTE]
>  The Update Media Content Wizard opens the media path in single-user mode, which assumes that no other users are simultaneously making updates to the files and folders in the media path. If other users make changes while the Update Media Content Wizard runs, those changes may be overwritten and lost during the generation process.  

###### To generate media images of media content  

1.  Click **Start**, and then point to **All Programs**. Point to **Microsoft Deployment Toolkit**, and then click **Deployment Workbench**.  

2.  In the Deployment Workbench console tree, go to Deployment Workbench/Deployment Shares/*deployment_share*/Advanced Configuration/Media (where *deployment_share* is the name of the deployment share to which you will add the application).

    |**Progress** |View the progress of the replication process.|  
    |**Confirmation** |You can click **Save Output** to save the output of the wizard to a file. You can also click **View Script** to view the Windows PowerShell scripts used to perform the wizard tasks.<br /><br /> Click **Finish**.|  

> [!NOTE]
>  If you view the output of the wizard, the generation process appears to have occurred twice. However, the process is actually performed in two passes: The first pass copies new items into the media target folders, and the second pass deletes any items that are no longer needed in the media target folders.  

 The Update Media Content Wizard finishes, and the following files are created:  

- An ISO file in the *media_folder* folder (where *media_folder* is the name of the folder that you specified for the media)  

   Generating the ISO file is an option that you configure by selecting the **Generate a Lite Touch bootable ISO image** check box on the **General** tab of the ***media*** **Properties** dialog box. Clear this check box to reduce the time needed to generate the media unless you need to create bootable DVDs or start VMs from the ISO file.  

- WIM files in the *media_folder*\Content\Deploy\Boot folder (where *media_folder* is the name of the folder that you specified for the media).  

  The folders and the content you specified in the selection profile in the media are stored in the image files.  

  You can also create a bootable device that contains a copy of the *media_folder*\Content folder (where *media_folder* is the name of the folder you specified for the media) so that you can start a target computer from a UFD or USB hard disk. For more information, see [Create Bootable Devices from Deployment Media](#CreateBootableDevicesfromDeploymentMedia).  

#####  <a name="CreateBootableDevicesfromDeploymentMedia"></a> Create Bootable Devices from Deployment Media  
 You may need to deploy images to target computers using a bootable device (such as a UFD or a USB hard disk) when the target computer does not have a high-speed, persistent connection to a deployment share.  

> [!NOTE]
>  The target computer must support starting from the device to use this method.  

###### To create bootable devices from deployment media  

1. On a computer running Windows 7 or later, insert the UFD or USB hard disk.  

2. Run Diskpart.exe, and type **list disk** to determine the disk number associated with the device.  

3. Type the following commands, where *N* is the disk number identified in step 2:  

   - **select disk *N***  

   - **clean**  

   - **create partition primary**  

   - **select partition 1**  

   - **active**  

   - **format fs=ntfs**  

   - **assign**  

   - **exit**  

4. Copy the contents of the *media_folder*\Content folder (where *media_folder* is the name of the folder you specified in the media) to the device.  

####  <a name="ManagetheMDTDB"></a> Manage the MDT DB  
 The MDT DB augments the configuration that CustomSettings.ini provides for both LTI and ZTI deployments. The MDT DB allows you to centrally manage configuration settings for the target computers. Although you can perform large-scale deployments using the CustomSettings.ini file, the MDT DB can help reduce the effort need to manage such deployments.  

 For more information on managing the MDT DB, see Performing Deployments Using the MDT DB.  

 In addtion to managing the MDT DB in the Deployment Workbench, you can manage the MDT DB using the MDT Windows PowerShell cmdlets. For more information on managing the MDT DB using the MDT Windows PowerShell cmdlets, see the following sections beneath the section, "MDT Windows PowerShell Cmdlets", in the MDT document *Toolkit Reference*:  

-   **New-MDTDatabase**  

-   **Update-MDTDatabaseSchema**  

###  <a name="ConfiguringLTITaskSequenceStepsintheDeploymentWorkbench"></a> Configuring LTI Task Sequence Steps in the Deployment Workbench  
 Configure LTI task sequences steps in the Deployment Workbench by:  

-   Configuring LTI task sequence step conditions as described in [Configure Task Sequence Step Conditions](#ConfigureTaskSequenceStepConditions)  

-   Configuring LTI task sequence steps that perform disk-related actions as described in [Configure Disk Task Sequence Steps](#ConfigureDiskTaskSequenceSteps)  

-   Configuring LTI task sequence steps that perform network-related actions as described in [Configure Network Task Sequence Steps](#ConfigureNetworkTaskSequenceSteps)  

-   Configuring LTI task sequence steps that perform server role-related actions as described in [Configure Server Role Task Sequence Steps for LTI](#ConfigureServerRoleTaskSequenceStepsforLTI)  

-   Configuring the **Check Bios** task sequence step to include a list of incompatible basic input/output system (BIOS) versions as described in [Configure the Check BIOS Task Sequence Step for the List of Incompatible BIOS Versions](#ConfiguretheCheckBIOSTaskSequenceStepfortheListofIncompatibleBIOSVersions)  

####  <a name="ConfigureTaskSequenceStepConditions"></a> Configure Task Sequence Step Conditions  
 In certain scenarios, consider conditionally running a task sequence step based on defined criteria. Configure task sequence step conditions on the **Options** tab of a task sequence step. Add any combinations of these conditions to determine whether the task sequence step should run. For example, you could use the values of a task sequence variable and of a registry setting to determine whether a task sequence step should run.  

 Configure conditional task sequence steps by performing any combination of the following actions:  

-   Add one or more IF statements to a task sequence step condition as described in [Add IF Statements to Task Sequence Step Conditions](#AddIFStatementstoTaskSequenceStepConditions).  

-   Add one or more task sequence variables to a task sequence step condition as described in [Add Task Sequence Variables to Task Sequence Step Conditions](#AddTaskSequenceVariablestoTaskSequenceStepConditions).  

-   Add one or more target operating system versions to a task sequence step condition as described in [Add Operating System Versions to Task Sequence Step Conditions](#AddOperatingSystemVersionstoTaskSequenceStepConditions).  

-   Add one or more WMI query results to a task sequence step condition as described in [Add WMI Queries to Task Sequence Step Conditions](#AddWMIQueriestoTaskSequenceStepConditions).  

-   Add the value of one or more registry settings to a task sequence step condition as described in [Add Registry Settings to Task Sequence Step Conditions](#AddRegistrySettingstoTaskSequenceStepConditions).  

-   Add the test for software installed on the target computer to a task sequence step condition as described in [Add a Test for Installed Software to Task Sequence Step Conditions](#AddaTestforInstalledSoftwaretoTaskSequenceStepConditions).  

-   Add the test for various folder properties to a task sequence step condition as described in [Add a Test for Folder Properties to Task Sequence Step Conditions](#AddaTestforFolderPropertiestoTaskSequenceStepConditions).  

-   Add the test for various file properties to a task sequence step condition as described in [Add a Test for File Properties to Task Sequence Step Conditions](#AddaTestforFilePropertiestoTaskSequenceStepConditions).  

#####  <a name="AddIFStatementstoTaskSequenceStepConditions"></a> Add IF Statements to Task Sequence Step Conditions  
 All task sequence conditions include one or more `IF` statements, which are the foundation for creating conditional task sequence steps. A task sequence step condition can include only one `IF` statement, but you can nest multiple `IF` statements beneath the top-level `IF` statement to create more complex conditions.  

 You test an IF statement based on the conditions listed in Table 77, which you configure in the `IF`**Statement Properties** dialog box.  

### Table 77. Conditions Available in IF Statements  

|**Condition** |**Select this option to run the task sequence if** |  
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|  
|**All conditions** |All the conditions beneath this IF statement must be true.|  
|**Any conditions** |Any the conditions beneath this IF statement are true.|  
|**None** |None the conditions beneath this IF statement are true.|  

 Complete the condition for running the task sequence step by adding other criteria to the conditions (for example, task sequence variables or values in a registry setting).  

###### To add an IF statement condition to a task sequence step  

1.  On the ***step*** **Option** tab (where *step* is the name of the task sequence step to configure), click **Add**, and then click **`If` statement**.  

2.  In the **`If` Statement Properties** dialog box, click ***condition*** (where *condition* is one of the conditions listed in Table 77), and then click **OK**.  

#####  <a name="AddTaskSequenceVariablestoTaskSequenceStepConditions"></a> Add Task Sequence Variables to Task Sequence Step Conditions  
 Create conditions based on any task sequence variable (including those that MDT defines). These variables also include the environment variables available in the operating system.  

 To configure a condition based on a task sequence variable, provide the following information in the **Task Sequence Variable Condition** dialog box:  

-   **Variable**. The name of the task sequence variable to include as a condition. This name must match the exact spelling of the variable but is not case sensitive.  

-   **Condition**. This can be **exists** (which is true if the variable exists, regardless of its value) or a standard logical operator.  

-   **Value**. The value of the task sequence variable to use in the condition.  

###### To add a Task Sequence Variable condition to a task sequence step  

1.  On the ***step*** **Options** tab (where *step* is the name of the task sequence step to configure), click **Add**, and then click **Task Sequence Variable**.  

2.  In the **Task Sequence Variable Condition** dialog box, in the **Variable box**, type ***variable*** (where *variable* is the name of the task sequence variable).

#####  <a name="AddWMIQueriestoTaskSequenceStepConditions"></a> Add WMI Queries to Task Sequence Step Conditions  
 You can use WMI queries in a task sequence condition. WMI is the primary management technology for Windows operating systems and enables consistent and uniform management, control, and monitoring of systems throughout the enterprise. Based on industry standards, WMI allows you to query, change, and monitor configuration settings on desktop and server systems, applications, networks, and other enterprise components. You can also write scripts that use the WMI scripting library to work with WMI and create a wide range of systems management and monitoring scripts. For more information about WMI, see the [WMI Scripting Primer](/previous-versions/tn-archive/ee156560(v=technet.10)).  

 To configure a condition based on a WMI condition, provide the following information in the **Task Sequence WMI Condition** dialog box:  

-   **WMI namespace**. The default, \root\cimv2, refers to a specific WMI namespace. Namespaces are grouped hierarchically and are similar to the way folders are grouped in the operating system. Within each namespace is a collection of classes that correspond to a managed resource.  

-   **WQL query**. This dialog box contains the query that runs when the conditions are met. WMI is generally queried in two ways: by retrieving an entire WMI object or by using a Structured Query Language (SQL)–like query. In the query, system information or querying computers could be accessed across a network.  

###### To add a WMI query result condition to a task sequence step  

1.  On the ***step*** **Option** tab (where *step* is the name of the task sequence step to configure), click **Add**, and then click **Query WMI**.  

2.  In the **Task Sequence WMI Condition** dialog box, in the **WMI namespace box**, type ***WMI namespace***.  

3.  In the **Task Sequence WMI Condition** dialog box, in the **WQL query box**, type the query script to be run, and then click **OK**.  

#####  <a name="AddRegistrySettingstoTaskSequenceStepConditions"></a> Add Registry Settings to Task Sequence Step Conditions  
 Evaluate registry settings during the task sequence; based on defined criteria, choose whether to run additional processes. The registry contains two basic elements: keys and values.  

- Registry keys are similar to folders. Each key can contain subkeys, which in turn can contain further subkeys, all of which might contain values. Keys are referenced with syntax similar to Windows path names, using backslashes (\\) to indicate levels of hierarchy. For example, **HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows** refers to the subkey **Windows** of the subkey **Microsoft** of the key **Software** of the subtree **HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE**.  

- Registry values are name–data pairs stored within but referenced separately from these keys. Value names can contain backslashes, but including backslashes so makes the values difficult to distinguish from their key paths.  

  To configure a condition based on a registry setting condition, provide the following information in the **Registry Setting** dialog box:  

- **Root key**. The subtree of the registry key. Base the condition on one of the following:  

  -   **HKEY_CURRENT_USER**  

  -   **HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE**  

  -   **HKEY_USERS**  

  -   **HKEY_CURRENT_CONFIG**  

- **Key**. The value of the registry key to use in the condition  

- **Condition**. A logical operator, such as `AND` or `OR`  

- **Value name**. The name of the value to use in the condition  

- **Value type**. The value type, which can be one of the following:  

  -   **REG_SZ**  

  -   **REG_EXPAND_SZ**  

  -   **REF_DWORD**  

- **Value**. The value of the value type for the provided registry key to use in the condition  

###### To add a Registry Setting condition to a task sequence step  

1.  On the ***step*** **Option** tab (where *step* is the name of the task sequence step to configure), click **Add**, and then click **Registry Setting**.  

2.  In the **Registry Setting** dialog box, in the **Root key box**, click ***Root key***.  

3.  In the **Registry Setting** dialog box, in the **Key box**, type ***key*** (where *key* is the remainder of the registry key minus the subtree).  

4.  In the **Registry Setting** dialog box, in the **Condition box**, click ***condition*** (where *condition* is the logical operation to use in the condition).  

5.  In the **Registry Setting** dialog box, in the **Value name box**, type the name of the ***Value name***.  

6.  In the **Registry Setting** dialog box, in the **Value type box**, click ***Value type***.

#####  <a name="ConfigureEnableBitLockerTaskSequenceSteps"></a> Configure Enable BitLocker Task Sequence Steps  
 Use this task to enable the **BitLocker** task. BitLocker is a full-disk encryption feature included in Windows designed to protect data by providing encryption for entire volumes. By default, it uses the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), also known as *Rijndael*, a block cipher adopted as an encryption standard by the U.S. government.  

 The AES algorithm in Cipher-block Chaining mode with a 128-bit key is often combined with the Elephant diffuser for additional security. BitLocker is available only in the Enterprise and Ultimate editions of Windows.  

 Select one of the following methods of enabling BitLocker:  

- In a task sequence, enable the **BitLocker** task.  

   In addition, configure the partition in the **Format and Partition** task, which is necessary for New Computer scenarios but not in Refresh Computer scenario. The most common configurations are:  

  -   One partition: 100%  

  -   One partition and some unallocated space  

- In the Deployment Wizard, configure the **BitLocker** page. This requires that the **Enable BitLocker** task be enabled in the task sequence used for deployment.  

- In the CustomSettings.ini file, set the following properties:  

  -   BDEInstall=TPM  

  -   BdeInstallSuppress=NO  

  -   BDeWaitForEncryption=False  

  -   BDEDriveSize=2000  

  -   BDEDriveLetter=S:  

  -   BDEKeyLocation=C:

The network settings that this task sequence step type configures are the same settings configured in the properties of a network adapter.  

 For each network adapter in the target computer, configure the corresponding network settings. If no configuration settings are specified, the **Apply Network Settings** task sequence step type configures the task sequence step that in turn configures the network adapters on the target computer to use Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) for configuration.  

> [!NOTE]
>  Network configuration settings the **Capture Network Settings** task sequence step captures in the State Capture phase override any configuration settings you specify in this task sequence type.  

 Some of the LTI task sequence templates in MDT include a task sequence step in the State Restore phase named Apply Network Settings. In most instances, configure the existing task sequence step instead of creating a new task sequence step.

####  <a name="ConfigureServerRoleTaskSequenceStepsforLTI"></a> Configure Server Role Task Sequence Steps for LTI  
 LTI can help automate the deployment of server roles in Windows Server. Configure LTI task sequence steps to deploy the supported server roles, which include:  

- AD DS  

- DNS Server  

- DHCP Server  

  The process for configuring the server role task sequence steps is similar for LTI and ZTI. For more information about configuring server role task sequence steps for LTI, see [Configuring Server Role Task Sequence Steps](#ConfiguringServerRoleTaskSequenceSteps).  

####  <a name="ConfiguretheCheckBIOSTaskSequenceStepfortheListofIncompatibleBIOSVersions"></a> Configure the Check BIOS Task Sequence Step for the List of Incompatible BIOS Versions  
 The default task order for a task sequence includes the **Check BIOS** task in the **Non-Replace** group in the **Validation** group. The **Check BIOS** task runs the ZTIBIOSCheck.wsf script, which checks the BIOS version of the target computers against the list of incompatible BIOS versions in the ZTIBIOSCheck.xml file.  

 Modify the ZTIBIOSCheck.xml file to contain the list of BIOS versions incompatible with the target operating system in the operating system build. Modify ZTIBIOSCheck.xml for each task sequence created in the Deployment Workbench. The ZTIBIOSCheck.xml file resides in the *deployment_share*\Scripts folder (where *deployment_share* is the name of the folder that is the root of the deployment share).  

 Update the attributes in the ZTIBIOSCheck.xml file listed in Table 85 for each incompatible BIOS version.  

### Table 85. Attributes to Update in the ZTIBIOSCheck.xml File  

|**Attribute** |**Description** |  
|-------------------|---------------------|  
|**Description** |Text description of the target computer that has an incompatible BIOS version, including any references to possible updates to the BIOS version|  
|**Computer Manufacturer** |Manufacturer of the target computer with an incompatible BIOS version (This value must match the value stored in the BIOS.)|  
|**Model** |Model of the target computer with an incompatible BIOS version (This value must match the value stored in the BIOS.)|  
|**Date** |Date of the BIOS of the target computer with an incompatible BIOS version (This value must match the value stored in the BIOS.)|  

 The ZTIBIOSCheck.xml file contains the source for a script (ZTIBIOS_Extract_Utility.vbs) that can help extract the attributes listed in Table 85.  

###### To use the ZTIBIOS_Extract_Utility.vbs utility to extract attributes on a target computer  

1.  Start Microsoft Notepad.  

2.  Copy the script source from ZTIBIOSCheck.xml file into Notepad.  

3.  Save the script source in Notepad as ZTIBIOS_Extract_Utility.vbs.  

4.  Run ZTIBIOS_Extract_Utility.vbs on a target computer that has an incompatible BIOS.  

5.  Update ZTIBIOSCheck.xml to include the BIOS based on the attributes retrieved in the previous steps.  

##  <a name="RunningtheDeploymentWizard"></a> Running the Deployment Wizard  
 To initiate the deployment of Windows to target computers, run the Deployment Wizard. Initiate the Deployment Wizard manually or by using Windows Deployment Services. Each deployment scenario (Replace Computer, New Computer, or Refresh Computer) uses a different process. Initiate the deployment from Windows Deployment Services, a network share, from local drives, or using a DVD. The deployment process prompts for any configuration settings not already specified.  

 The Deployment Wizard is run just prior to the Deployment Wizard and is responsible for initializing the environment. The Deployment Wizard displays wizard pages based on the deployment scenario you selected and the configuration options you specified in CustomSettings.ini. The logic for displaying (or not displaying) a wizard page is noted for each wizard page in the following steps.  

#### To deploy the new operating system to the target computer using the Deployment Wizard  

1. Verify that the folders in Table 86 no longer exist on the target computer.  

    The Deployment Wizard creates and uses the folders listed in Table 86 during the deployment process. If a previous deployment was terminated because of an error, these folders might still exist on the target computer. If these folders are not removed, the process will continue from the point where the previous process terminated instead of starting from the beginning. Remove these folders before initiating a new deployment. These folders exist on *target_drive* (where *target_drive* is the drive on the target computer that has the most available disk space).  

   ### Table 86. Folders to Remove Before Initiating the Deployment Wizard  

   |            **Folder**             |                                                                       **Description**                                                                       |
   |-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
   |      *target_drive:*\MININT       | This folder is preserved through the deployment process and contains deployment state information (such as user state migration information and log files). |
   | *target_drive:\\_SMSTaskSequence* |                                           This folder contains state information specific to the Task Sequencer.                                            |


2. Initiate the Deployment Wizard.  

   1.  Start the target computer with LTI bootable media from a CD, DVD, removable device, or Windows Deployment Services.  

   2.  Connect to the appropriate deployment share (for example, \\\server_name\Distribution$\Scripts), and then type **cscript litetouch.vbs**.  

3. The Deployment Wizard starts. This wizard is responsible for initialing the Windows PE environment prior to running the Deployment Wizard. The Initializing wizard page appears, which displays the initialization status. The Windows Deployment wizard connects to the deployment share and displays the **Welcome** wizard page when the conditions in Table 87 are met.   

   ### Table 87. Welcome Wizard page Conditions  

   |**Property** |**Condition** |  
   |------------------|-------------------|

-   Preparing the ZTI deployment environment as described in [Preparing the ZTI Deployment Environment for Configuration Manager](#PreparingtheZTIDeploymentEnvironmentforConfigurationManager)  

-   Preparing for ZTI deployment to the reference computer as described in [Preparing for ZTI Deployment to the Reference Computer Using Configuration Manager](#PreparingforZTIDeploymenttotheReferenceComputerUsingConfigurationManager)  

-   Deploying to and capturing an image of the reference computer in ZTI as described in [Deploying To and Capturing an Image of the Reference Computer Using Configuration Manager](#DeployingToandCapturinganImageoftheReferenceComputerUsingConfigurationManager)  

-   Preparing for ZTI deployment to the target computers as described in [Preparing for ZTI Deployment to Target Computers Using Configuration Manager](#PreparingforZTIDeploymenttoTargetComputersUsingConfigurationManager)  

-   Deploying captured images to the target computer in ZTI as described in [Deploying Captured Images to Target Computers Using Configuration Manager](#DeployingCapturedImagestoTargetComputersUsingConfigurationManager)  

###  <a name="PreparingtheZTIDeploymentEnvironmentforConfigurationManager"></a> Preparing the ZTI Deployment Environment for Configuration Manager  
 After you have prepared the prerequisite infrastructure for MDT, you are ready to prepare the MDT deployment environment for ZTI.  

##### To prepare the MDT deployment environment for ZTI deployments  

1.  Preparing the prerequisite infrastructure as described in [Prepare the Prerequisite ZTI Infrastructure for Use with Configuration Manager](#PreparethePrerequisiteZTIInfrastructureforUsewithConfigurationManager).  

2.  Install a new instance of MDT on the deployment server, or upgrade an existing instance of MDT to MDT as described in [Install or Upgrade to MDT for the ZTI Deployment Process Using Configuration Manager](#InstallorUpgradetoMDTfortheZTIDeploymentProcessUsingConfigurationManager).  

3.  Obtain the software that ZTI requires as described in [Obtain the Software That the ZTI Deployment Process Using Configuration Manager Requires](#ObtaintheSoftwareThattheZTIDeploymentProcessUsingConfigurationManagerRequires).  

4.  Enable Configuration Manager console integration with MDT as described in [Enable Configuration Manager Console Integration for Configuration Manager](#EnableConfigurationManagerConsoleIntegrationforConfigurationManager).  

####  <a name="PreparethePrerequisiteZTIInfrastructureforUsewithConfigurationManager"></a> Prepare the Prerequisite ZTI Infrastructure for Use with Configuration Manager  
 ZTI deployments using Configuration Manager require that a properly configured Configuration Manager infrastructure exist prior to installing MDT and performing deployments. Ensure that your new or existing Configuration Manager infrastructure is specifically optimized for the Operating System Deployment feature.  

> [!NOTE]
>  Windows PowerShell version 2.0 or later must be installed on any computer on which MDT is installed for management of ZTI deployments.  

 For more information about:  

-   Hardware and software requirements for Configuration Manager, see [Supported Configurations for Configuration Manager](../core/plan-design/configs/supported-configurations.md)  

-   Configuring a Configuration Manager infrastructure to support ZTI deployments, see the section, "Step 1: Prepare the Prerequisite Infrastructure", in the MDT document *Quick Start Guide for Microsoft System Center 2012 R2 Configuration Manager*.  

####  <a name="InstallorUpgradetoMDTfortheZTIDeploymentProcessUsingConfigurationManager"></a> Install or Upgrade to MDT for the ZTI Deployment Process Using Configuration Manager  
 The first step in performing ZTI deployments is to have at least one instance of MDT running in your environment. Install MDT on each computer that has the Configuration Manager console installed and that you will use to create or edit task sequences that MDT generates. If your existing environment has:  

-   No computers currently running MDT or a previous version of MDT, install one or more new instances of MDT as described in [Installing a New Instance of MDT](#InstallingaNewInstanceofMDT).  

-   One or more computers running a previous version of MDT, upgrade those instances to MDT as described in [Upgrading to MDT](#UpgradingtoMDT). After the upgrade process is complete:  

    -   **Run the Configure ConfigMgr Integration Wizard**. This wizard must be run after the upgrade to register the new components and install the ZTI new task sequence templates.  

    -   **Run the Remove PXE Filter Wizard**. If you had previously installed and configured the PXE filter to support the unknown computer capability in previous versions of MDT. This support is now provided in Configuration Manager and has been removed in MDT.  

    -   **Ensure you create a new Microsoft Deployment Toolkit Files package for any new ZTI task sequences you create**. The existing Microsoft Deployment Toolkit Files package can be used for any ZTI task sequences created prior to the upgrade, but a new Microsoft Deployment Toolkit Files package must be created for new ZTI task sequences.  

    -   **Ensure any ZTI task sequences created prior to the upgrade use the Microsoft Deployment Toolkit Files package that existed prior to the upgrade**. You can modify these ZTI task sequences, but you cannot use any of the new MDT task sequence actions or steps. To use the new MDT task sequence actions or steps, create a new ZTI task sequence.  

        > [!NOTE]
        >  If you upgraded from a previous version of Configuration Manager, you can use ZTI task sequences for MDT that were created in the previous version of Configuration Manager as long as they were created using the same version of MDT.  

####  <a name="ObtaintheSoftwareThattheZTIDeploymentProcessUsingConfigurationManagerRequires"></a> Obtain the Software That the ZTI Deployment Process Using Configuration Manager Requires  
 Collect the software needed during the ZTI deployment process for Configuration Manager. This software will be imported or added to deployment shares unless it already exists in the deployment share.  

> [!NOTE]
>  MDT supports the Windows ADK for Windows 8.1, Windows PE 5.0, and System Center 2012 R2 Configuration Manager.  

 Required software includes:  

-   Operating system source files for each operating system to be deployed to the reference and target computers  

-   Operating system packages for the operating systems, such as security updates, feature packs, and language packs  

-   Device drivers for the reference and target computers that are not included as part of the operating system  

-   Applications that are to be installed as a part of the operating system image or during the deployment of the reference image  

-   USMT source files used to create a software package that is deployed to the target computers to capture user state migration data  

####  <a name="EnableConfigurationManagerConsoleIntegrationforConfigurationManager"></a> Enable Configuration Manager Console Integration for Configuration Manager  
 Before you can use the Configuration Manager integration features of MDT, run the Configure ConfigMgr Integration Wizard. This wizard copies the appropriate Configuration Manager integration files to the *Configuration Manager_root* (where *Configuration Manager_root* is the folder in which the Configuration Manager console is installed).  

 The wizard also adds WMI classes for the new MDT custom actions. You add these classes by compiling a Managed Object Format (.mof) file that contains the new class definitions.  

###### To run the Configure ConfigMgr Integration Wizard  

1. > [!NOTE]
   >  The Configuration Manager console should be closed when performing this procedure.  

    Click **Start**, and then point to **All Programs**. Point to **Microsoft Deployment Toolkit**, and then click **Configure ConfigMgr Integration**.

   |**Confirmation** |Review the completion status of the wizard, and then click **Finish**.|  

   When the wizard finishes, the Configuration Manager console is configured for MDT integration.  

###  <a name="PreparingforZTIDeploymenttotheReferenceComputerUsingConfigurationManager"></a> Preparing for ZTI Deployment to the Reference Computer Using Configuration Manager  
 Regardless of the ZTI deployment scenario you are performing, always start by creating a reference computer, and then capturing an image of that computer. Later in the ZTI deployment process, you will deploy the captured image of your reference computer to the appropriate target computers.  

 Create a reference computer for each image that you want to create for deployment to the target computers. For more information about determining the number of images required in your organization (and subsequently the number of reference computers required), see [Estimate Storage Requirements for Configuration Manager Distribution Points](#EstimateStorageRequirementsforConfigurationManagerDistributionPoints).

####  <a name="IdentifythePackagesandImagesThattheMDTTaskSequenceTemplatesinConfigurationManagerRequire"></a> Identify the Packages and Images That the MDT Task Sequence Templates in Configuration Manager Require  
 Table 122 lists the packages and images that the task sequence templates in MDT require. These packages and images must exist (or be created) for the task sequences to run correctly in Configuration Manager.  

### Table 122. Packages and Images Required by the Task Sequence Templates Included in MDT for Configuration Manager  

|**This package or image** |**Contains the** |  
|-------------------------------|----------------------|  
|Boot image package|Boot image used to initiate the ZTI deployment process and in the middle of the process when performing the Refresh Computer deployment scenario.|  
|Microsoft Deployment Files package|Script and tools necessary for the MDT task sequence templates for Configuration Manager.|  
|OS image package|Image of the target operating system to be deployed to the target computer.|  
|OS install package|All the files required to install the operating system (using Windows Setup.exe).|  
|Client package|Configuration Manager client installation files.|  
|USMT package|USMT files used to capture and restore user state.|  
|Custom Settings package|Contains unattended files and customsettings.ini.|  

> [!NOTE]
>  You can use the generic boot images (WIM files) that the Deployment Workbench generates in ZTI deployments. However, you cannot use the LTI LiteTouch boot images (WIM files) that the Deployment Workbench generates in ZTI deployments using Configuration Manager.  

 The Create MDT Task Sequence Wizard can automatically create these packages and images or can use existing packages and images. The task sequence templates contain placeholders for each package and image listed in Table 122. The Create MDT Task Sequence Wizard substitutes the packages and images selected for the placeholders in the task sequence templates. After completing the wizard, the new created task sequence references the appropriate packages and images.  

 In addition to the packages and images that the task sequence templates require, consider creating and including the following elements in the task sequences to provide similar functionality in the Deployment Workbench:  

-   **Software distribution packages**. This package includes any software that will be installed as part of the operating system deployment (similar to the Applications node in the Deployment Workbench). These packages are created as packages and programs in Configuration Manager. For more information on how to create these packages, see the following sections in the Configuration Manager Documentation Library, which is included with Configuration Manager:  

    -   "Content Management in Configuration Manager"  

    -   "Application Management in Configuration Manager"  

-   **Windows package file (software update) packages**. These packages include any Windows package files that contain software updates (such as language packs, security updates, and service packs) that will be installed as part of the operating system deployment (similar to the OS Packages node in the Deployment Workbench). You can use these software update packages:  

    -   Without modification by using the Software Updates feature in Configuration Manager. For more information on using these packages in the Software Updates feature, see the section, "Software Updates in Configuration Manager," in the Configuration Manager Documentation Library, which is included with Configuration Manager.  

    -   As installed directly by ZTI using the **Install Updates Offline** task sequence step type. For more information about configuring a task sequence step based on this type, see [Configuring ZTI Task Sequence Steps in Configuration Manager](#ConfiguringZTITaskSequenceStepsinConfigurationManager).  

    -   Custom software distribution packages in Configuration Manager. For more information on how to create these packages, see the section, "Technical Reference for Content Management in Configuration Manager," in the Configuration Manager Documentation Library, which is included with Configuration Manager.  

-   **Device driver package**. Configuration Manager uses driver packages to control the distribution of drivers to distribution points. You can specify device driver categories in an **Auto Apply Drivers** task sequence step type to limit which drivers are installed, or you can install all device drivers using an **Apply driver package** task sequence step type. For more information about how to include device drivers in the operating system image, see the section, "How to Install Device Drivers to Computers by Using Task Sequences," in the Configuration Manager Documentation Library, which is included with Configuration Manager.

###  <a name="ManagingOperatingSystemsinConfigurationManager"></a> Managing Operating Systems in Configuration Manager  
 Manage operating systems in the Operating Systems node in the Software Library workspace. The operating systems are contained and managed in the following nodes beneath the Operating Systems node:  

- **Operating System Installers**. This node contains operating systems that are used to deploy reference computers and are based on the install.wim file from the original operating system media.  

- **Operating System Images**. This node contains captured operating system images from reference computers and that are deployed to your target computers.  

  For more information about managing operating systems in the Configuration Manager console, see the section, "Configuring Configuration Manager for Operating System Deployments," in the Configuration Manager Documentation Library, which is installed with Configuration Manager.  

###  <a name="ManagingDeviceDriversinConfigurationManager"></a> Managing Device Drivers in Configuration Manager  
 Manage device drivers in the Configuration Manager console in Configuration Manager by:  

-   Importing the device drivers into Configuration Manager as described in [Import Drivers into Configuration Manager](#ImportDriversintoConfigurationManager)  

-   Creating a new driver package that contains the device drivers as described in [Create a New Configuration Manager Driver Package](#CreateaNewConfigurationManagerDriverPackage)  

-   Adding device drivers and device driver packages to operating systems and boot images as described in [Add Device Drivers to Operating System and Boot Images in Configuration Manager](#AddDeviceDriverstoOperatingSystemandBootImagesinConfigurationManager)  

-   Deploying specific device drivers to target computers for ZTI deployments as described in [Deploy Specific Device Drivers to Target Computers in Configuration Manager](#DeploySpecificDeviceDriverstoTargetComputersinConfigurationManager)  

####  <a name="ImportDriversintoConfigurationManager"></a> Import Drivers into Configuration Manager  
 To import drivers into Configuration Manager, use the Import New Driver Wizard. For information about this wizard, see the section, "How to Import Windows Device Drivers into the Driver Catalog," in the Configuration Manager Documentation Library, which is installed with Configuration Manager.  

####  <a name="CreateaNewConfigurationManagerDriverPackage"></a> Create a New Configuration Manager Driver Package  
 A driver package contains the content associated with one or more device drivers. You must add device drivers to a driver package and copy them to a distribution point before Configuration Manager clients can install them. For information about creating a new driver package, see the section, "How to Create a New Driver Package," in the Configuration Manger Documentation Library, which is installed with Configuration Manager.  

####  <a name="AddDeviceDriverstoOperatingSystemandBootImagesinConfigurationManager"></a> Add Device Drivers to Operating System and Boot Images in Configuration Manager  
 When you have added device drivers to the driver catalog, you can add them to existing operating systems and boot images. The driver catalog helps manage the cost and complexity of deploying an operating system in an environment that contains different types of computers and devices. Storing device drivers in the driver catalog and not with each individual operating system image greatly reduces the number of operating system images you need.  

 For information about managing the driver catalog, see the section, "How to Manage the Driver Catalog in Configuration Manager," in the Configuration Manager Documentation Library, which is installed with Configuration Manager.  

###### To add device drivers to operating systems and boot images in Configuration Manager  

-   Add device drivers from the driver catalog to existing operating systems as described in [Add Device Drivers to an Operating System in Configuration Manager](#AddDeviceDriverstoanOperatingSysteminConfigurationManager).  

-   Add device drivers from the driver catalog to existing boot images as described in [Add Device Drivers to a Boot Image in Configuration Manager](#AddDeviceDriverstoaBootImageinConfigurationManager).  

#####  <a name="AddDeviceDriverstoanOperatingSysteminConfigurationManager"></a> Add Device Drivers to an Operating System in Configuration Manager  
 Add new device drivers to an existing operating system image using the Task Sequence Editor. To allow Configuration Manager to search in the driver catalog for the new device drivers, add an **Auto Apply Drivers** task sequence step to an existing task sequence.  

 For information about adding device drivers to an operating system, see the section, "How to Install Device Drivers to Computers by Using Task Sequences," in the Configuration Manager Documentation Library, which is installed with Configuration Manager.  

#####  <a name="AddDeviceDriverstoaBootImageinConfigurationManager"></a> Add Device Drivers to a Boot Image in Configuration Manager  
 You can add Windows device drivers that you have imported into the driver catalog to one or more boot images. Only mass storage device drivers and network adapter device drivers should be added to boot images, because other types of drivers are not needed and will increase the size of the boot image. Only add valid device drivers that are intended for use with Windows 8.1, because the version of Windows PE is based on Windows 8.1.  

 For information about adding device drivers to boot images, see the section, "How to Add and Remove Device Drivers That Are Associated with Driver Packages and Boot Images," in the Configuration Manager Documentation Library, which is installed with Configuration Manager.  

####  <a name="DeploySpecificDeviceDriverstoTargetComputersinConfigurationManager"></a> Deploy Specific Device Drivers to Target Computers in Configuration Manager  
 By default, ZTI using Configuration Manager deploys all device drivers to the target computers. Then, the target operating system uses Plug-and-Play IDs to identify the device drivers needed for the devices on the target computers.  

 To change this default behavior, configure the ZTI deployment process to install specific drivers to target computers as described in [Control Device Driver Deployments Using Configuration Manager for ZTI](#ControlDeviceDriverDeploymentsUsingConfigurationManagerforZTI). For more information about strategies for device driver management, see [Select the Device Driver Management Strategy](#SelecttheDeviceDriverManagementStrategy).  

###  <a name="DeployinganOperatingSystemUsingTaskSequenceBootableMediainConfigurationManager"></a> Deploying an Operating System Using Task Sequence Bootable Media in Configuration Manager  
 To initiate ZTI deployment using Configuration Manager from bootable media, start the target computer with the bootable media. The boot process starts Windows PE, and then starts ZTI. You can start the target computer from a UFD, CD, or DVD.  

> [!NOTE]
>  The ZTI deployment process using Configuration Manager can also be initiated by starting the target computer from Windows Deployment Services. However, for reference computers it may be easier to start the ZTI deployment process from bootable media.  

 For more information about how to deploy an operating system using task sequence bootable media, see the section "How to Deploy Operating Systems by Using Media in Configuration Manager" in the Configuration Manager Documentation Library, which is installed with Configuration Manager.

###  <a name="ManagingSoftwarePackagesinConfigurationManager"></a> Managing Software Packages in Configuration Manager  
 Manage software packages in the Configuration Manager console in Configuration Manager by:  

-   Adding language packs as described in [Add Language Packs in Configuration Manager](#AddLanguagePacksinConfigurationManager)  

-   Adding software updates as described in [Add Software Updates in Configuration Manager](#AddSoftwareUpdatesinConfigurationManager)  

####  <a name="AddLanguagePacksinConfigurationManager"></a> Add Language Packs in Configuration Manager  
 *Language packs* are .cab files that you can add to Configuration Manager packages either offline or online. Before adding language packs, however, create a Configuration Manager package that contains one or more language packs.  

 The number of language packs that you add to a Configuration Manager package is based on the type of deployment being performed. When deploying language packs using:  

-   ZTI, put one or more language packs in each Configuration Manager package. This allows you to bundle the necessary language packs for your organization and include them in one Configuration Manager package.  

     If you bundle two or more language packs in a Configuration Manager package and deploy that package, all language packs will be deployed. If you want to deploy different combination of language packs, then consider bundling one language pack in a Configuration Manager package and create a separate, conditional task sequence step to deploy each different language pack.  

-   UDI, put only one language pack in each Configuration Manager package. This one-to-one relationship allows the user to select individual language packs as desired in the UDI Wizard.  

###### To create a Configuration Manager package that contains one or more language packs  

1. Create a folder that will contain the package source for the language pack (.cab file).  

   > [!NOTE]
   >  Create this folder where previously created packages are stored or where space is available.  

2. Create a subfolder beneath the folder you created in step 1 for the language pack (.cab file).  

3. Add the language pack (.cab file) downloaded from Microsoft into the subfolder created in step 2.  

   > [!NOTE]
   >  Language packs already in .cab format are available for download from the Microsoft Volume Licensing website.  

4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 for each language pack that you want to be a part of the package.  

5. Run the **New Package Wizard** in the Configuration Manager console, ensuring the following options are selected during the wizard:  

   - On the **Data Source** wizard page, click **This package contains source files**, and then click **Set** to set the source directory to the folder you created in step 1.  

   - On the **Data Source** wizard page, select the **Enable binary differential replication** check box.

##  <a name="PerformingUDIDeployments"></a> Performing UDI Deployments  
 You perform UDI deployments in MDT using Configuration Manager within an AD DS domain, within a Windows workgroup, or from removable media.  

> [!NOTE]
>  If you are unfamiliar with UDI, review the UDI terms and terminology in the section, "UDI Concepts", in the MDT document *Microsoft Deployment Toolkit Reference*. Familiarizing yourself with these terms and terminology will help you be more successful in applying the remainder of this guide to your organization.  

 Perform UDI deployments by:  

-   Reviewing the overview information for UDI deployments as described in [Overview of UDI Deployments](#OverviewofUDIDeployments)  

-   Preparing the UDI deployment environment as described in [Preparing the UDI Deployment Environment](#PreparingtheUDIDeploymentEnvironment)  

-   Preparing for UDI deployment to the reference computer as described in [Preparing for UDI Deployment to the Reference Computer](#PreparingforUDIDeploymenttotheReferenceComputer)  

-   Deploying to and capturing an image of the reference computer in UDI as described in [Deploying To and Capturing an Image of the Reference Computer Using UDI](#DeployingToandCapturinganImageoftheReferenceComputerUsingUDI)

-   Deploying captured images to the target computer using UDI as described in [Deploying Captured Images to Target Computers Using UDI](#DeployingCapturedImagestoTargetComputersUsingUDI)  

###  <a name="OverviewofUDIDeployments"></a> Overview of UDI Deployments  
 UDI allows the interactive deployment of Windows operating systems and applications using Configuration Manager. Typically, when deploying operating systems using the OSD feature in Configuration Manager and ZTI in MDT, you must provide all the information necessary to deploy the operating system. Prior to performing the deployment, the information is configured in configuration files or in databases (such as the CustomSettings.ini file or the MDT DB). During the ZTI deployment process, ZTI converts the appropriate configuration settings to task sequence variables, which the MDT task sequences consume for UDI. All of the configuration settings must be provided before you can initiate the deployment.  

 UDI provides a wizard-driven interface that runs on the target computer, which allows you to provide configuration information immediately prior to operating system and application deployment. This allows you to create generic OSD task sequences, and then have other users provide computer specific information at the time of deployment, which provides greater flexibility in the deployment process.  

> [!NOTE]
>  If you are unfamiliar with UDI, review the UDI terms and terminology in the section, "UDI Concepts", in the MDT document *Microsoft Deployment Toolkit Reference*.

####  <a name="OverviewofUDIinMDTDeploymentScenarios"></a> Overview of UDI in MDT Deployment Scenarios  
 UDI supports the New Computer, Refresh Computer, and Replace Computer MDT deployment scenarios, which were described in [Identifying Deployment Scenarios](#IdentifyingDeploymentScenarios). UDI supports these deployments scenarios using the Configuration Manager task sequence templates provided with MDT. Table 136 lists the MDT deployment scenarios and the corresponding UDI task sequence templates used to perform the deployment scenario.  

### Table 136. MDT Deployment Scenarios and UDI Task Sequence Templates Used to Perform the Scenarios  

|**Deployment scenario** |**UDI tasks sequences used** |  
|-----------------------------|----------------------------------|  
|New Computer|Run task sequence created using **User Driven Installation Task Sequence** task sequence template.|  
|Refresh Computer|Run task sequence created using **User Driven Installation Task Sequence** task sequence template.|  
|Replace Computer|- Run task sequence created using **User Driven Installation Replace Task Sequence** task sequence template on existing computer.<br /><br /> - Run the task sequence created using the **User Driven Installation Task Sequence** task sequence template on the new computer.|  

 The UDI Wizard is run by the **UDI Wizard** task sequence step in these task sequences at the appropriate place in the task sequence. To identify how UDI performs each of the MDT deployment scenarios, see the subsequent sections:  

- [UDI in the New Computer Deployment Scenario](#UDIintheNewComputerDeploymentScenario)  

- [UDI in the Refresh Computer Deployment Scenario](#UDIintheRefreshComputerDeploymentScenario)  

- [UDI in the Replace Computer Deployment Scenario](#UDIintheReplaceComputerDeploymentScenario)  

  For more details about how UDI operates in each of these MDT deployment scenarios, see the corresponding sections in "UDI Stage Reference" in *Microsoft Deployment Toolkit Reference*.  

#####  <a name="UDIintheNewComputerDeploymentScenario"></a> UDI in the New Computer Deployment Scenario  
 For the New Computer Deployment Wizard, the operating system images can be in the following locations:  

- **On a distribution point**. This method uses the traditional OSD deployment methodology in Configuration Manager.  

- **On a local disk on the target computer**. This method leverages the prestaged media feature in Configuration Manager.  

  Task sequences created using the **User Driven Installation Task Sequence** task sequence template automatically detect which method to use and perform the deployment accordingly. The New Computer deployment scenario always begins with the target computer running Windows PE, which is how the tasks sequence knows the difference between the New Computer deployment scenario and the Refresh Computer deployments scenario. Figure 2 illustrates how UDI is used in the New Computer deployment scenario using the traditional OSD deployment methodology in Configuration Manager with the operating system image located on a distribution point.  

  ![Figure 2. Process flow for UDI performing the New Computer deployment scenario for images stored on distribution points](media/MDTDevToolkit2.jpg)

  **Figure 2. Process flow for UDI performing the New Computer deployment scenario for images stored on distribution points**  

  Figure 3 illustrates how UDI is used in the New Computer deployment scenario using the prestaged media feature in Configuration Manager with the operating system image located on a local disk on the target computer.

#####  <a name="UDIintheRefreshComputerDeploymentScenario"></a> UDI in the Refresh Computer Deployment Scenario  
 Task sequences used to perform the Refresh Computer scenario use the same task sequence template as the New Computer scenario, the **User Driven Installation Task Sequence** task sequence template. The Refresh Computer deployment scenario always begins with the target computer running the existing Windows operating system, which is how the tasks sequence knows the difference between the Refresh Computer deployment scenario and the New Computer deployments scenario. Figure 4 illustrates how UDI is used in the Refresh Computer deployment scenario.

#####  <a name="UDIintheReplaceComputerDeploymentScenario"></a> UDI in the Replace Computer Deployment Scenario  
 The Replace Computer scenario requires the following task sequences.  

- A task sequence created using the **User Driven Installation Replace Task Sequence** task sequence template. This task sequence is run first on the existing computer and is used to capture user state migration data to a network shared folder or to a USB disk that is attached to the existing computer.  

- A task sequence created using the **User Driven Installation Task Sequence** task sequence template. This task sequence is run second on the replacement computer and is used to install the operating system, install the applications, and to restore user state migration data saved by the task sequence run on the existing computer.  

  Figure 5 illustrates how UDI is used in the Replace Computer deployment scenario.

####  <a name="OverviewofBuiltinUDIComponents"></a> Overview of Built-in UDI Components  
 UDI comes with built-in Configuration Manager task sequences, stage groups, stages, tasks, validators, and wizard pages that can perform most common deployment scenarios without the assistance of a developer. These built-in components can be configured using the UDI Wizard Designer:  

 For more information about the built-in UDI components, see the following sections in the *Microsoft Deployment Toolkit Reference*:  

- "UDI Stage Reference"  

- "UDI Wizard Page Reference"  

- "UDI Task Reference"  

- "UDI Validator Reference"  

  In addition to these built-in components, you can create custom wizard pages, wizard page editors, tasks, and validators using the UDI software development kit (SDK). The UDI SDK is installed with MDT and contains example solutions for Microsoft Visual Studio 2010. For more information about extending UDI using the UDI SDK, see the MDT document *User-Driven Installation Developers Guide*.  

###  <a name="PreparingtheUDIDeploymentEnvironment"></a> Preparing the UDI Deployment Environment  
 After you have prepared the prerequisite infrastructure for MDT, you are ready to prepare the MDT deployment environment for UDI.  

##### To prepare the MDT deployment environment for UDI deployments  

1.  Preparing the prerequisite infrastructure as described in [Prepare the Prerequisite Infrastructure for UDI Deployments](#PreparethePrerequisiteInfrastructureforUDIDeployments).  

2.  Install a new instance of MDT on the deployment server, or upgrade an existing instance of MDT to MDT as described in [Install or Upgrade to MDT for UDI Deployments](#InstallorUpgradetoMDTforUDIDeployments).  

3.  Obtain the software that UDI requires as described in [Obtain the Software That the UDI Deployment Process Requires](#ObtaintheSoftwareThattheUDIDeploymentProcessRequires).  

4.  Enable Configuration Manager console integration with MDT as described in [Enable Configuration Manager Console Integration for UDI](#EnableConfigurationManagerConsoleIntegrationforUDI).  

####  <a name="PreparethePrerequisiteInfrastructureforUDIDeployments"></a> Prepare the Prerequisite Infrastructure for UDI Deployments  
 UDI deployments require that a properly configured Configuration Manager infrastructure exist prior to installing MDT and performing deployments. Ensure that your new or existing Configuration Manager infrastructure is specifically optimized for the Operating System Deployment feature.  

> [!NOTE]
>  Windows PowerShell version 2.0 or later must be installed on any computer on which MDT is installed for management of UDI deployments.  

 For more information about:  

-   Hardware and software requirements for Configuration Manager, see [Supported Configurations for Configuration Manager](../core/plan-design/configs/supported-configurations.md).

-   Configuring a Configuration Manager infrastructure to support UDI deployments, see the section, "Step 1: Prepare the Prerequisite Infrastructure", in the MDT document Quick Start Guide for User-Driven Installation.  

####  <a name="InstallorUpgradetoMDTforUDIDeployments"></a> Install or Upgrade to MDT for UDI Deployments  
 The first step in performing UDI deployments is to have at least one instance of MDT running in your environment. Install MDT on each computer that has the Configuration Manager console installed and that you will use to create or edit task sequences that MDT generates. If your existing environment has:  

-   No computers currently running MDT or a previous version of MDT, install one or more new instances of MDT as described in [Installing a New Instance of MDT](#InstallingaNewInstanceofMDT).  

-   One or more computers running a previous version of MDT, upgrade those instances to MDT as described in [Upgrading to MDT](#UpgradingtoMDT). After the upgrade process is complete:  

    -   **Run the Configure ConfigMgr Integration Wizard**. This wizard must be run after the upgrade to register the new components and install the UDI new task sequence templates.  

    -   **Ensure you create a new Microsoft Deployment Toolkit Files package for any new UDI task sequences you create**. The existing Microsoft Deployment Toolkit Files package can be used for any UDI task sequences created prior to the upgrade, but a new Microsoft Deployment Toolkit Files package must be created for new UDI task sequences.  

    -   **Ensure any UDI task sequences created prior to the upgrade use the Microsoft Deployment Toolkit Files package that existed prior to the upgrade**. You can modify these UDI task sequences, but you cannot use any of the new MDT task sequence actions or steps. To use the new MDT task sequence actions or steps, create a new UDI task sequence.  

####  <a name="ObtaintheSoftwareThattheUDIDeploymentProcessRequires"></a> Obtain the Software That the UDI Deployment Process Requires  
 Collect the software needed during the UDI deployment process. This software will be imported or added to deployment shares unless it already exists in the deployment share.  

> [!NOTE]
>  UDI requires Configuration Manager.  

 Required software includes:  

-   Operating system source files for each operating system to be deployed to the reference and target computers  

-   Operating system packages for the operating systems, such as security updates, feature packs, and language packs  

-   Device drivers for the reference and target computers that are not included as part of the operating system  

-   Applications that are to be installed as a part of the operating system image or during the deployment of the reference image  

-   USMT source files used to create a software package that is deployed to the target computers to capture user state migration data  

####  <a name="EnableConfigurationManagerConsoleIntegrationforUDI"></a> Enable Configuration Manager Console Integration for UDI  
 Before you can use the Configuration Manager integration features of MDT, run the Configure ConfigMgr Integration Wizard. This wizard copies the appropriate Configuration Manager integration files to the *Configuration Manager _root* (where *Configuration Manager _root* is the folder in which the Configuration Manager console is installed).  

 The wizard also adds WMI classes for the new MDT custom actions. You add these classes by compiling a .mof file that contains the new class definitions.  

 **To run the Configure ConfigMgr Integration Wizard**  

> [!NOTE]
>  The Configuration Manager console should be closed when performing this procedure.  

- Click **Start**, and then point to **All Programs**. Point to **Microsoft Deployment Toolkit**, and then click **Configure ConfigMgr Integration**.  

   The Configure ConfigMgr Integration Wizard starts.  

- Complete the Configure ConfigMgr Integration Wizard using the information in Table 137. Accept the default values unless otherwise specified.  

  ### Table 137. Information for Completing the Configure ConfigMgr Integration Wizard  

  |**On this wizard page** |**Do this** |  
  |-----------------------------|-----------------|  
  |**Options** |1. Verify that the **Install the MDT console extensions for System Center 2012 R2 Configuration Manager** check box is selected.<br /><br /> 2. Verify that the **Add the MDT task sequence actions to a System Center 2012 R2 Configuration Manager server** check box is selected.<br /><br /> 3. In **Site server name**, type ***ConfigMgr_server_name*** (where *ConfigMgr_server_name* is the name of the Configuration Manager server on which to install MDT integration).<br /><br /> 4. In **Site code**, type ***ConfigMgr_site_code*** (where *ConfigMgr_site_code* is the Configuration Manager site code that installs MDT integration).<br /><br /> 5. Click **Next**.<br /><br /> The Site Server Name and Site Code fields will be automatically populated with the most recent connection details if the Configuration Manager console has been opened once.|  
  |**Confirmation** |Click **Finish**.|  

  The Configure ConfigMgr Integration Wizard finishes, and MDT is integrated with Configuration Manager.  

###  <a name="PreparingforUDIDeploymenttotheReferenceComputer"></a> Preparing for UDI Deployment to the Reference Computer  
 Regardless of the MDT deployment scenario you are performing using UDI, always start by creating a reference computer, and then capturing an image of that computer. Later in the MDT deployment process, you will deploy the captured image of your reference computer to the appropriate target computers. In addition, you can use existing operating system images in WIM format.  

 Create a reference computer for each image that you want to create for deployment to the target computers. For more information about determining the number of images required in your organization (and subsequently the number of reference computers required), see [Estimate Storage Requirements for Configuration Manager Distribution Points](#EstimateStorageRequirementsforConfigurationManagerDistributionPoints). For more information about the use of reference computers in MDT deployments, see [Using Reference Computers in MDT Deployments](#UsingReferenceComputersinMDTDeployments).  

##### To prepare for deployment to the reference computer  

1.  Create a new task sequence that will deploy the target operating system to the reference computer using the Create MDT Task Sequence Wizard in the Configuration Manager console as described in [Creating a UDI Task Sequence Using MDT Task Sequence Templates](#CreatingaUDITaskSequenceUsingMDTTaskSequenceTemplates).  

    > [!TIP]
    >  Create the task sequence for deploying to the reference computer based on the User-Driven Installation task sequence template included in MDT.  

2.  Configure Configuration Manager to contain the appropriate software for deployment to the reference computer, including the following:  

    -   Configuring applications and operating system packages as described in [Managing Software Packages in Configuration Manager which is the same process for UDI and ZTI deployments](#ManagingSoftwarePackagesinConfigurationManager).  

    -   Configuring device drivers as described in [Managing Device Drivers in Configuration Manager](#ManagingDeviceDriversinConfigurationManager), which is the same process for UDI and ZTI deployments.  

3.  Ensure that all packages, including operating system deployment packages, that the new UDI task sequence uses are properly distributed to the assigned distribution points as described in [Managing Distribution Points in Configuration Manager](#ManagingDistributionPointsinConfigurationManager), which is the same process for UDI and ZTI deployments.  

    > [!NOTE]
    >  Most production networks have multiple distribution points. When performing this step in a production environment, select the appropriate distribution points for the network.  

4.  Customize the MDT configuration files to the needs of your organization as described in [Configuring MDT Deployments](#ConfiguringMDTDeployments).  

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    >  If you are capturing an image of the reference computer, you must at least add the **DoCapture** property to the CustomSettings.ini file for the task sequence by specifying `DoCapture=YES` or `DoCapture=SYSPREP`.  

5.  Optionally, enable monitoring of the MDT deployment process as described in [Monitoring MDT Deployments](#MonitoringMDTDeployments).  

6.  Customize the task sequence to the needs of your organization as described in [Configuring ZTI Task Sequence Steps in Configuration Manager](#ConfiguringZTITaskSequenceStepsinConfigurationManager), which is the same process for UDI and ZTI deployments.  

    > [!NOTE]
    >  The UDI deployment process is unable to perform Sysprep operations on a target computer that is encrypted by using BitLocker Drive Encryption. Do not enable BitLocker on the reference computer, and enable BitLocker on the target computers only after the target operating system is completely deployed.  

###  <a name="DeployingToandCapturinganImageoftheReferenceComputerUsingUDI"></a> Deploying To and Capturing an Image of the Reference Computer Using UDI  
 After the distribution points are updated, advertise the task sequence to the reference computer and start the reference computer with the bootable Windows PE image created earlier in the process. The task sequence created earlier will deploy the target operating system, device drivers, operating system packages, and applications to the reference computer, and then capture an image of the reference computer.  

##### To deploy to and capture an image of the reference computer  

1.  Add the reference computer to the Configuration Manager site database as described in Manually Adding Computers to the Site Database in Configuration Manager , which is the same process for UDI and ZTI deployments.  

2.  Create a collection that contains the reference computer as described in [Managing Computer Collections in Configuration Manager](#ManagingComputerCollectionsinConfigurationManager), which is the same process for UDI and ZTI deployments.  

3.  Deploy the task sequence to the reference computer as described in [Managing Task Sequence Deployment in Configuration Manager](#ManagingTaskSequenceDeploymentinConfigurationManager), which is the same process for UDI and ZTI deployments.  

4.  Optionally, enable monitoring of the MDT deployment process as described in [Monitoring MDT Deployments](#MonitoringMDTDeployments).  

5.  Create a task sequence bootable media disk by using the Task Sequence Media Wizard as described in [Creating Task Sequence Bootable Media in Configuration Manager](#CreatingTaskSequenceBootableMediainConfigurationManager), which is the same process for UDI and ZTI deployments.  

6.  Start the reference computer with the task sequence bootable media disk as described in [Deploying an Operating System Using Task Sequence Bootable Media in Configuration Manager](#DeployinganOperatingSystemUsingTaskSequenceBootableMediainConfigurationManager) which is the same process for UDI and ZTI deployments.  

###  <a name="PreparingforUDIDeploymenttoTargetComputers"></a> Preparing for UDI Deployment to Target Computers  
 After the images of the reference computers are captured, deploy them to the target computers. In preparation for deploying the captured images to the target computers, create one or more task sequences for deploying the captured images, ensure that the necessary deployment resources exist, and customize the MDT deployment process.  

##### To prepare for UDI deployment to target computers  

1. Prepare network shares for storing migration data and MDT deployment logs as described in [Preparing the MDT Migration Resources](#PreparingtheMDTMigrationResources).  

2. Optionally, prepare Windows Deployment Services to start the appropriate Windows PE images that will in turn start the UDI deployment process to the target computers as described in [Preparing Windows Deployment Services for UDI Deployments](#PreparingWindowsDeploymentServicesforUDIDeployments).  

3. Create additional distribution points to help in larger deployments as described in [Managing Distribution Points in Configuration Manager](#ManagingDistributionPointsinConfigurationManager), which is the same process for UDI and ZTI deployments.  

4. Prepare the UDI task sequences, the MDT configuration files, the UDI Wizard configuration files, and the MDT DB for each deployment scenario as described in the following sections:

###  <a name="OverviewofUDIAdministration"></a> Overview of UDI Administration  
 The goal of UDI administration is to configure the user experience in the UDI Wizard and ultimately control the deployment of Windows operating systems and applications to target computers. You configure the UDI user experience by using the UDI Wizard Designer and by customizing the Configuration Manager task sequences used with UDI in the Configuration Manager Console.  

 The primary tool for administering UDI is the UDI Wizard designer. The UDI Wizard Designer is installed as a part of MDT, which is installed on the same computer at the Configuration Manager Console. Because UDI is built-on the OSD feature in Configuration Manager, you will also use the Configuration Manager Console to administer specific aspects of UDI deployments.  

 Figure 6 illustrates the high-level overview of the UDI administrative process.  

 ![Figure 6 illustrates the high-level overview of the UDI administrative process.](media/MDTDevToolkit6.jpg)

 **Figure 6. Overview of UDI administration process**  

 The UDI administration process, as illustrated in Figure 6, is performed as follows:  

1.  Create a UDI task sequence based on the task sequence templates built-in to MDT.  

     As a part of creating the task sequence, the **Create MDT Task Sequence** wizard creates an MDT toolkit package that contains the contents of the **installation_folder\Templates\Distribution** folder (where *installation_folder* is the folder where you installed MDT). The toolkit package is referenced by the **Use Toolkit Package** task sequence step.  

     For more information about the built-in UDI tasks sequence templates in MDT, see [Identify the UDI Task Sequence Templates in MDT](#IdentifytheUDITaskSequenceTemplatesinMDT).  

2.  Distribute the MDT toolkit package to Configuration Manager distribution points.  

     The UDI Wizard and UDI Wizard configuration file are contained in the package. The UDI Wizard (UDIWizard.exe) is in the **Tools** folder in the package. The UDI Wizard configuration file (UDIWizard_Config.xml) is in the **Scripts** folder in the package.  

3.  Customize the UDI Wizard configuration file and application information file using the UDI Wizard Designer.  

     The UDI Wizard configuration file (UDIWizard_Config.xml) and application information file (UDIWizard_Config.xml.app) are stored in the **Scripts** folder in the MDT toolkit package.  

4.  Update the distribution points with the modified version of the UDI Wizard configuration file and corresponding application information file in the MDT toolkit package.  

5.  The target computers initiate the UDI task sequence which runs the UDI Wizard at the appropriate point in the task sequence.  

     The UDI Wizard is initiated using the **UDI Wizard** task sequence step.  

6.  The UDI Wizard runs and the deployment configuration information is collected from the user.  

     The UDI Wizard reads the UDI Wizard configuration file to determine the wizard pages to display and the sequence of the pages. The user completes the UDI Wizard by providing the necessary deployment information. The UDI Wizard updates task sequence variables based on the information provided. The updated task sequence variables are used by the UDI task sequence to perform the balance of the deployment.  

7.  The remainder of the task sequence steps in the UDI task sequence complete and the **OSD Results** dialog is displayed at the end of the deployment. Any applications installed during the task sequences are identified the first time a user logs in using **AppInstaller**.  

     AppInstaller enables Configuration Manager to identify any applications installed using the Application model during the task sequence. This allows Configuration Manager to use features such as the monitoring feature.  

###  <a name="CreatingaUDITaskSequenceUsingMDTTaskSequenceTemplates"></a> Creating a UDI Task Sequence Using MDT Task Sequence Templates  
 Use the Create MDT Task Sequence Wizard in the Configuration Manager console to create task sequences in Configuration Manager that are integrated with MDT. MDT includes task sequence templates that you can use to deploy the reference and target computers.  

 Create UDI task sequences using the MDT task sequence templates by:  

-   Identifying the UDI task sequence templates that are a part of MDT as described in [Identify the UDI Task Sequence Templates in MDT](#IdentifytheUDITaskSequenceTemplatesinMDT)  

-   Identifying the packages and images that the UDI task sequence templates require as described in [Identify the Packages and Images That the UDI Task Sequence Templates Require](#IdentifythePackagesandImagesThattheUDITaskSequenceTemplatesRequire)  

-   Creating UDI task sequences as described in [Create UDI Task Sequences Using the Create MDT Task Sequence Wizard](#CreateUDITaskSequencesUsingtheCreateMDTTaskSequenceWizard)  

-   Configure UDI task sequences to deploy different operating systems as described in [Configure UDI Task Sequences to Deploy Different Operating Systems](#ConfigureUDITaskSequencestoDeployDifferentOperatingSystems)  

####  <a name="IdentifytheUDITaskSequenceTemplatesinMDT"></a> Identify the UDI Task Sequence Templates in MDT  
 MDT includes task sequence templates that are used to create MDT task sequences in Configuration Manager. The task sequence templates included in MDT are described in [Identify the Task Sequence Templates in MDT in Configuration Manager](#IdentifytheTaskSequenceTemplatesinMDTinConfigurationManager).  

 Of the templates described in [Identify the Task Sequence Templates in MDT in Configuration Manager](#IdentifytheTaskSequenceTemplatesinMDTinConfigurationManager), the following are used in MDT deployment scenarios using UDI:  

- **Client Task Sequence**. This task sequence template is used for the MDT New Computer, Refresh Computer, and Replace Computer deployment scenarios. This task sequence template is also used to build and capture images of the reference computers.  

- **User Driven Installation Replace Task Sequence**. This task sequence template is the first step in a two-step process in the MDT Replace Computer deployment scenario and is used to capture user state migration data. The second step in the two step process is the User Driven Installation Task Sequence task sequence template, which is used to:  

  -   Deploy the target applications and operating system  

  -   Restore the user state migration data saved during the User Driven Installation Replace task Sequence task sequence template in the first step of the process  

  For more information on the MDT deployment scenarios, see [Identifying Deployment Scenarios](#IdentifyingDeploymentScenarios).  

> [!NOTE]
>  Always use the Create MDT Task Sequence Wizard to create task sequences. Although you can manually create the task sequences, doing so is not recommended.  

####  <a name="IdentifythePackagesandImagesThattheUDITaskSequenceTemplatesRequire"></a> Identify the Packages and Images That the UDI Task Sequence Templates Require  
 The UDI task sequence templates require the same packages and images as required by ZTI deployments, as described in [Identify the Packages and Images That the MDT Task Sequence Templates in Configuration Manager Require](#IdentifythePackagesandImagesThattheMDTTaskSequenceTemplatesinConfigurationManagerRequire).  

####  <a name="CreateUDITaskSequencesUsingtheCreateMDTTaskSequenceWizard"></a> Create UDI Task Sequences Using the Create MDT Task Sequence Wizard  
 The Create MDT Task Sequence Wizard substitutes the packages and images selected for the placeholders in the task sequence templates. After completing the wizard, the new task sequence references the appropriate packages and images.  

> [!NOTE]
>  Always use the Create MDT Task Sequence Wizard to create task sequences based on the MDT task sequence templates. Although you can manually import the task sequence templates, doing so is not recommend.  

 Create UDI task sequences using the same process for creating ZTI task sequences using the Create MDT Task Sequence Wizard as described in [Create ZTI Task Sequences Using the Create MDT Task Sequence Wizard in Configuration Manager](#CreateZTITaskSequencesUsingtheCreateMDTTaskSequenceWizardinConfigurationManager)  

 Select the appropriate UDI task sequence template based on the deployment scenario being performed. For more information about the UDI task sequence templates in MDT, see [Identify the UDI Task Sequence Templates in MDT](#IdentifytheUDITaskSequenceTemplatesinMDT).  

####  <a name="ConfigureUDITaskSequencestoDeployDifferentOperatingSystems"></a> Configure UDI Task Sequences to Deploy Different Operating Systems  
 The **VolumePage** page in built-in UDI stage groups allows you to select from any operating system images that you have configured in the UDI Wizard Designer. However, the task sequence created by the Create MDT Task Sequence wizard references only one specific operating system image in the **Apply Operating System Image** task sequence step.  

 When you select the operating system image on the **VolumePage** page, the UDI Wizard sets the **OSDImageName** task sequence variable to the value of the image name that was selected. The value of the **OSDImageName** task sequence variable corresponds to the name of the operating system image in the **Operating System Images** or **Operating System Installers** nodes in the Configuration Manager console.  

 You can configure a UDI task sequence to support the operating systems you have added to the **VolumePage** page by performing the following steps:  

1. Rename the existing **Apply Operating System Image** task sequence step to reflect the name of the operating system image being deployed.  

2. Configure a condition for the existing **Apply Operating System Image** task sequence step that will only run the step when the **OSDImageName** task sequence variable is equal to the name of the operating system image being deployed.  

3. For each operating system that has been added to the **VolumePage** page, perform the following steps:  

   1.  Add a new **Apply Operating System Image** task sequence step that reflects the name of the operating system image to be deployed.  

   2.  Configure a condition for the new **Apply Operating System Image** task sequence step that will only run the step when the **OSDImageName** task sequence variable is equal to the name of the operating system image to be deployed.  

   After performing these steps, when the user selected an operating system image on the **VolumePage** page, the corresponding **Apply Operating System Image** task sequence step will be run and deploy the appropriate operating system image.  

###  <a name="ConfiguringUDIWizardBehavior"></a> Configuring UDI Wizard Behavior  
 The User-Driven Installation Task Sequence and User-Driven Installation Replace Task Sequence templates include task sequence steps that run the UDI Wizard. When a task sequence step runs the UDI Wizard, the step also references the UDIWizard_Config.xml file, which controls the behavior of the UDI Wizard and is stored in the Scripts folder of the MDT files package. You can customize the UDIWizard_Config.xml file using the UDI Wizard Designer.  

 Configure the UDI Wizard behavior by performing the following steps in the UDI Wizard Designer:

####  <a name="ReviewtheRelationshipAmongUDIWizardPagesWizardPageEditorsandtheUDIWizardConfigurationFile"></a> Review the Relationship Among UDI Wizard Pages, Wizard Page Editors, and the UDI Wizard Configuration File  
 For each wizard page displayed in the UDI Wizard, there is a corresponding wizard page editor that can be used to configure that wizard page using the UDI Wizard Designer. The UDI Wizard configuration file (UDIWizard_Config.xml) is used to store the configuration settings for each wizard page. Figure 7 illustrates the relationship between UDI wizard pages, UDI wizard page editors, and the UDI Wizard configuration file.  

 ![Figure 7. Relationship between UDI wizard pages, UDI wizard page editors, and the UDI Wizard configuration file](media/MDTDevToolkit7.jpg)

 **Figure 7. Relationship between UDI wizard pages, UDI wizard page editors, and the UDI Wizard configuration file**  

 In the UDI Wizard configuration file, there is a separate **Page** XML element for each wizard page that is displayed in the UDI Wizard. When you add a wizard page using the UDI Wizard Designer a corresponding **Page** XML element is created in the UDI Wizard configuration file. Similarly, when you remove a wizard page, the corresponding **Page** XML element is removed.  

 Each **Page** XML element has child XML elements for each configuration setting for the wizard page. These child XML elements are also configured using the wizard page editors in the UDI Wizard Designer.  

 For a complete list of the **Page** XML elements, see the "UDI Wizard Configuration File Schema Reference".  

> [!NOTE]

####  <a name="PrepareforLanguagePackDeploymentinUDI"></a> Prepare for Language Pack Deployment in UDI  
 One the UDI Wizard page types available in the Page Library in the UDI Wizard Designer is the **LanguagePage** wizard page type. The **LanguagePage** wizard page type allows you to select the:  

- Default language  

- Time and currency format (locale)  

- Keyboard layout  

- Time zone  

  Specifically, the **LanguagePage** wizard page allows you select the default language of the target operating system. However, additional steps must be performed to support the selection and subsequent deployment of the language pack for the target operating system.  

###### To support the deployment of multiple languages as the default language for target computers  

1. Add a language pack that you want to support in UDI using the **Install Language Packs Offline** task sequence as described in [Add Language Packs in Configuration Manager](#AddLanguagePacksinConfigurationManager)  

2. For the **Install Language Packs Offline** task sequence step created in step 1, configure the task sequence step to run on the condition that the **UILanguage** task sequence variable is equal to the language pack added in step 1  

   > [!TIP]
   >  You configure conditions on the **Options** tab of the task sequence step. Add a **Task Sequence Variable** condition.  

    For example, if you add a Japanese language pack, then the condition for the corresponding **Install Language Packs Offline** task sequence step will be for the **UILanguage** task sequence variable to be equal to **JA-JP**.  

   For more information on the **LanguagePage** wizard page type in the UDI Wizard Designer, see the corresponding section in the *User-Driven Installation Developers Guide*.  

####  <a name="SkipaWizardPage"></a> Skip a Wizard Page  
 In some instances, you may want to further control and simplify the UDI Wizard experience by skipping (removing) wizard pages. Skipping a wizard page allows you to provide configuration values usually provided by the user for the wizard page. Also, skipping a wizard page is simpler and less confusing than disabling (locking) all the controls on a wizard page.  

###### To skip a wizard page  

1.  Identify the variables that are written by the wizard page in a specific stage.  

     To identify the variables written by a specific wizard page, see the corresponding section for the wizard page in "UDI Wizard Page Reference".  

2.  Configure the variables identified in the previous step in the CustomSettings.ini or the MDT DB.  

3.  Remove the wizard page from the stage within a stage by using the **Remove Item** action on the Ribbon in the **Flow Designer** group.  

###  <a name="CreatingCustomWizardPagesUsingtheBuildYourOwnPageFeature"></a> Creating Custom Wizard Pages Using the Build Your Own Page Feature  
 There may be instances in which you want to collect additional deployment information to be used in UDI. You must collect this additional information in the UDI Wizard using a custom wizard page. You can create custom wizard pages using the:  

- **Build Your Own Page feature**. This feature allows you to create a custom wizard page for collecting deployment information without requiring you to write code or have developer skills. Use this feature if you need to collect basic information without advanced user interaction. For example, you cannot add any code or customize UI fonts using this feature.  

- **UDI SDK and Visual Studio**. Use this SDK if you want to create an advanced, fully customized wizard page in Visual Studio for collecting deployment information. Although the UDI SDK allows you to create customized wizard pages, such as adding custom code or changing fonts, this method requires developer skills.  

   For more information on using the UDI SDK to create custom wizard pages, see "Creating Custom UDI Wizard Pages" in the *User-Driven Installation Developers Guide*.  

  Create custom wizard pages using the Build Your Own Page Feature in UDI by performing the following tasks:  

- Create a new custom wizard page in a stage group as described in [Create a New Custom Wizard Page](#CreateaNewCustomWizardPage).  

- Add a control to a custom wizard page as described in [Add a Control to a Custom Wizard Page](#AddaControltoaCustomWizardPage).  

- Position a control on a custom wizard page as described in [Position a Control on a Custom Wizard Page](#PositionaControlonaCustomWizardPage).  

- Change the size of a control on a custom wizard page as described in [Change the Size of a Control on a Custom Wizard Page](#ChangetheSizeofaControlonaCustomWizardPage).  

- Remove a control from a custom wizard page as described in [Remove a Control from a Custom Wizard Page](#RemoveaControlfromaCustomWizardPage).  

- Edit the properties of a control on a custom wizard page as described in [Edit Custom Wizard Page Control Properties](#EditCustomWizardPageControlProperties).  

- Show or hide the gridlines on a custom wizard page as described in [Show or Hide Custom Wizard Page Gridlines](#ShoworHideCustomWizardPageGridlines).  

- Verify and test the custom wizard page after you create it as described in [Verify and Test a Custom Wizard Page](#VerifyandTestaCustomWizardPage).  

####  <a name="CreateaNewCustomWizardPage"></a> Create a New Custom Wizard Page

9. In the Page Library, click ***display_name***. Drag the page to the appropriate place in ***stage_group*** on the **Flow** tab (where *display_name* is the user-friendly name of the wizard page and *stage_group* is the name of the stage group to which you want to add the new custom wizard page).  

####  <a name="AddaControltoaCustomWizardPage"></a> Add a Control to a Custom Wizard Page  
 After a new UDI custom wizard page is added to a stage group, you must add the appropriate controls to the new custom wizard page. You add these controls from the Build Your Own Page toolbox, which is displayed when you view the custom wizard page on the **Configure** tab in the UDI Wizard Designer.  

  Table 149 lists the types of controls to your custom wizard page, which is illustrated in Figure 13.  

### Table 149. Types of Controls in the UDI Build Your Own Page Toolbox  

|**Control type** |**Description** |  
|----------------------|---------------------|  
|**Checkbox** |This control allows you select or clear a configuration option and behaves as a traditional UI check box. This control has a corresponding label that you can use to describe the purpose of the check box. The state of this control is True when the check box is selected and False when the check box is cleared. The state of the check box is stored in the task sequence variable configured for this control. For more information on this control, see "Checkbox Control" in the MDT document, *Toolkit Reference*.|  
|**Combobox** |This control allows you to select an item from a list of items and behaves as a traditional UI drop-down list. This control allows you to add or remove items from the list and provide a corresponding value that will be set in the task sequence variable configured for this control. For more information on this control, see "Combobox Control" in the MDT document, *Toolkit Reference*.|  
|**Line** |This control allows you to add a horizontal line to divide one portion of the custom wizard page from another. This control does not collect any configuration values but rather is used to visually enhance the UI. For more information on this control, see "Line Control" in the MDT document, *Toolkit Reference*.|  
|**Label** |This control allows you to add descriptive, read-only text to the wizard page. This control does not collect any configuration values but rather is used to visually enhance the UI. For more information on this control, see "Label Control" in the MDT document, *Toolkit Reference*.|  
|**Radio** |This control allows you to select one configuration option from a group of two or more options. As with traditional radio buttons, two or more of these controls can be grouped together, and then the user can select one of the options in the radio button group. A unique value is assigned to each option. The value assigned to the selected option control is saved in the task sequence variable configured for this control. For more information on this control, see "Radio Control" in the MDT document, *Toolkit Reference*.|  
|**Bitmap** |This control allows you to add a bitmap graphic (.bmp file) to the custom wizard page. This control does not collect any configuration values but rather is used to visually enhance the UI. The path to the .bmp file is relative to the location of the UDI Wizard (OSDSetupWizard.exe). For more information on this control, see "Bitmap Control" in the MDT document, *Toolkit Reference*.|  
|**Textbox** |This control allows you to enter text on the custom wizard page. The text typed into this control is saved in the task sequence variable configured for this control. For more information on this control, see "Textbox Control" in the MDT document, *Toolkit Reference*.|  

 You can add any combination of these controls to your custom wizard page based on the information you want to collect. In addition, you can use the **Show Gridlines** check box to show or hide gridlines that can be used to assist in visually designing the custom wizard page.

 For more information on how to preview wizard pages and the wizard page sequence flow, see [Preview Wizard Pages and the Wizard Page Sequence Flow](#PreviewWizardPagesandtheWizardPageSequenceFlow).  

##  <a name="RunningtheUDIWizard"></a> Running the UDI Wizard  
 The UDI Wizard is automatically initiated when you run a UDI-based task sequence. Initiate the UDI-based task sequence automatically by using Windows Deployment Services or manually by using a deployed (advertised) task sequence in the Configuration Manager Client. Each MDT deployment scenario (New Computer, Refresh Computer, or Replace Computer) uses a different process. Initiate the deployment from Windows Deployment Services or using task sequence bootable media. The deployment process prompts for any configuration settings not already specified.  

 The UDI Wizard displays wizard pages based on the MDT deployment scenario you selected and the configuration options you saved in UDI Wizard configuration file (UDIWizard_Config.xml) in the Scripts folder of the MDT files package. The controls that are enabled and their default values are also controlled by the configuration options you saved in the UDI Wizard configuration file.  

#### To run the UDI Wizard  

1. Initiate the task sequence created using a UDI-based task sequence template and one of the following methods:  

   - Task sequence bootable media disk using the Task Sequence Media Wizard as described in [Creating Task Sequence Bootable Media in Configuration Manager](#CreatingTaskSequenceBootableMediainConfigurationManager).  

   - Windows Deployment Services to start the appropriate Windows PE images that will in turn start the UDI deployment process to the target computers as described in [Preparing Windows Deployment Services for UDI Deployments](#PreparingWindowsDeploymentServicesforUDIDeployments).  

     Windows PE starts, and then the Task Sequence Wizard starts.  

2. Complete the Task Sequence Wizard by selecting the appropriate UDI-based task sequence.  

    At the appropriate task sequence step, the UDI Wizard starts.  

3. Complete the UDI Wizard based on the wizard pages selected and the sequence of the wizard pages.  

   > [!TIP]
   >  Ensure that you preview the user experience of the wizard pages in the UDI Wizard using the Preview feature in the UDI Wizard Designer prior to performing deployments in your production environment.  

   After you complete the UDI Wizard, the deployment of the new operating system begins. When the deployment process is complete, the **OSD Results** page is displayed just prior to the first user logging on to the target computer. For more information about how to configure the **OSD Results** page, see the section, "OSDResults.exe.config File Element Values", in the MDT document *Toolkit Reference*.

####  <a name="SectionsintheCustomSettings.iniFile"></a> Sections in the CustomSettings.ini File  
 Sections are identified by brackets (`[]`) that surround the section name (for example, `[Settings]`). In Listing 1, the sections include `[Settings]`, `[Default]`, `[00:0F:20:35:DE:AC]`, and `[00:03:FF:FE:FF:FF]`.  

 The sections in the CustomSettings.ini file include the:  

-   Required sections as described in [Required Sections](#RequiredSections)  

-   Optional sections as described in [Optional Sections](#OptionalSections)  

#####  <a name="RequiredSections"></a> Required Sections  
 Only the `[Settings]` section is required. All other sections are optional. The MDT scripts require the `[Settings]` section in CustomSettings.ini to locate the reserved properties (**Priority** and **Properties**).  

#####  <a name="OptionalSections"></a> Optional Sections  
 You use the optional sections in the CustomSettings.ini file to assign a group of configuration settings to:  

-   **A group of computers**. In Listing 1, the configuration settings in the `[Default]`section are applied to more than one computer. For more information, see [Applying MDT Properties to Groups of Computers](#ApplyingMDTPropertiestoGroupsofComputers), later in this guide.  

-   **An individual computer**. In Listing 1, the configuration settings in the `[00:0F:20:35:DE:AC]` and `[00:03:FF:FE:FF:FF]` sections are applied to the corresponding computer (in this case, identified by the media access control [MAC] address of the target computer). For more information, see [Applying MDT Properties to Individual Computers](#ApplyingMDTPropertiestoIndividualComputers), later in this guide.  

####  <a name="PropertiesintheCustomSettings.iniFile"></a> Properties in the CustomSettings.ini File  
 Properties are variables to which values must be assigned. Properties are followed by an equal sign (=). The scripts scan the CustomSettings.ini file to locate the properties.  

 The types of properties that you can use in deploying target computers include properties that are:  

- **Automatically declared in ZTIGather.wsf**. These predefined properties are declared in the ZTIGather.wsf code and are documented in the MDT document *Toolkit Reference*. In addition, the ZTIGather.wsf file automatically sets the values for these properties. These properties are not configured in CustomSettings.ini and should be treated as read only.  

- **Declared in the ZTIGather.xml file**. These predefined properties are listed in the ZTIGather.xml file and are documented in the MDT document *Toolkit Reference*. The ZTIGather.wsf file retrieves these properties by scanning the ZTIGather.xml file. Divide the properties in this file into properties that:  

  -   **ZTIGather.wsf automatically assigns values to**. ZTIGather.wsf automatically sets the values for these properties, which must be treated as read only.  

  -   **Must be assigned values in CustomSettings.ini**. Ensure that the value for any property to be used is set in CustomSettings.ini and is considered modifiable.  

- **Declared in the Properties property**. These are custom properties that can be declared, and they are in addition to the properties automatically declared in ZTIGather.wsf and in ZTIGather.xml.  

  The way you use properties for ZTI and LTI are identical. However, some properties are unique to ZTI or LTI deployment. Like ZTI deployments, LTI deployments also have unique properties. Most of the LTI-specific properties relate to the Deployment Wizard (such as **SkipAdministratorPassword**, **SkipCapture**, or **SkipUserData**). Although these properties use the same syntax as other properties, the reserved properties perform specific functions in the deployment processing rules.  

> [!NOTE]
>  Property values must be specified in upper case so that the deployment scripts can properly identify them—for example, YES, TRUE, or FALSE. This is true for property values specified in the CustomSettings.ini file, BootStrap.ini file, and MDT DB.  

 Configure the CustomSettings.ini file by:  

-   Configuring the **Priority** reserved property as described in [Priority Reserved Property](#PriorityReservedProperty)  

-   Configuring the **Properties** reserved property as described in [Properties Reserved Property](#PropertiesReservedProperty)  

-   Configuring the values for properties as described in [Values in the CustomSettings.ini File](#ValuesintheCustomSettings.iniFile)  

#####  <a name="PriorityReservedProperty"></a> Priority Reserved Property  
 The **Priority** reserved property determines the sequence and section in which you can find configuration values. Each section is searched in the order specified. When a property value is found, the remaining sections are not used for that property. In Listing 1, the `[Default]` section is parsed first, and then the section that corresponds to the MAC address of the target computer (in this case, `[00:0F:20:35:DE:AC]` or `[00:03:FF:FE:FF:FF]`).  

  Table 152 lists the types of sections that you can reference in the **Priority** property.  

### Table 152. Section Types for the Priority Property  

|Type|You can base sections on|  
|----------|------------------------------|  
|MDT properties|Any property known MDT. For example, specifying the **HostName** property causes MDT to scan for a section with the target computer host name. Other properties, like **MACAddress**, can result in multiple section names being checked (because a computer can have multiple MAC addresses).|  
|Literal section name|A literal name that you specify in the **Priority** property. For example, if `MySection` is included in the **Priority** property, MDT would search for properties not previously found in the `[MySection]`section.|  
|Indirect reference|A literal name that references a section, which in turn references other sections. For example, if the **DefaultGateway** property is included in the **Priority** property, MDT would search for the `[DefaultGateway]` section. If the `[DefaultGateway]` section references other sections (based on the IP address of the default gateway), this is an example of an indirect reference. For an example of indirect reference using the **DefaultGateway** property, see "Example: Computer Groupings Selected by Woodgrove Bank" in [Select the Method for Grouping Computers](#SelecttheMethodforGroupingComputers).|  

#####  <a name="PropertiesReservedProperty"></a> Properties Reserved Property  
 The **Properties** reserved property (shown in Listing 1) defines any custom, user-defined properties to be used in the deployment. These user-defined properties are located by ZTIGather.wsf script in the CustomSettings.ini file (or configuration database). These properties are in addition to the predefined properties in MDT.  

 In Listing 1, **CustomProperty** is a user-defined property, and **ScanStateArgs** is a predefined property. For a list of the predefined properties in MDT, see the section, "Properties", in the MDT document *Toolkit Reference*.  

 You can also define custom properties to which you can assign multiple values by adding numerical suffixes, such as **ListProperty001**, **ListProperty002**, and so on. You create these types of custom properties by adding "`(*)`" to the end of the property name. For example, **ListProperty(\*)** defines the custom property as a list of property values instead of a single-valued property. Consider the following excerpt from a CustomSettings.ini file in which **ListProperty(\*)** is defined:  

```  
[Settings]  
Priority=Default  
Property=CustomProperty, ListProperty(*)  

[Default]  
CustomProperty=TRUE  
ListProperty001=New York City  
ListProperty002=Chicago  
```  

#####  <a name="ValuesintheCustomSettings.iniFile"></a> Values in the CustomSettings.ini File  
 *Values* are the configuration settings assigned to the properties. Values are preceded by an equal sign (=). The scripts scan the CustomSettings.ini file to locate the values. In Listing 1, the value assigned to the **LoadStateArgs** property is:  

```  
/v:5 /c /lac  
```  

> [!NOTE]
>  the CustomSettings.ini file is different from traditional INI files in that you do not place quotation marks around values, even if the value contains spaces.  

####  <a name="SubsectionsintheCustomSettings.iniFile"></a> Subsections in the CustomSettings.ini File  
 You can create subsections in the Customsettings.ini file based on the value of a property using the **Subsection** directive. The value of the **Subsection** directive can be used to dynamically reference subsections that can be used to group configuration settings.  

  Listing 2 illustrates an excerpt of a CustomSettings.ini file that uses the **Subsection** directive to dynamically reference subsections based on the computer model, which is specified in the **Model** property.  

 **Listing 2. Using the Subsection Directive to Dynamically Reference Subsections in the CustomSettings.ini File**  

```  
[Settings]  
Priority=Make, Default  

[Default]  

[Contoso Computer Corporation]  
Subsection=Contoso-%Model%  

[Contoso-MDT 6600]  
Packages001=XXX00009:Program9  
Packages002=XXX0000A:Program10  

[Contoso-MDT 2431]  
Packages001=XXX00003:Program2  
Packages002=XXX00003:Program4  

```  

 In Listing 2, the **Priority** line contains the **Make** property, which is used to references subsections based on the value of the **Make** property. The "Contoso Computer Corporation" subsection is referenced when the value of the **Make** property is equal to "Contoso Computer Corporation".  

 The "Contoso Computer Corporation" subsection contains a **Subsection** line that references other subsections based on the value of the **Model** property. In this example, the "Contoso-MDT 6600" and "Contoso-MDT 2431" sections will be processed by MDT depending on the value of the **Model** property.  

####  <a name="UserExitScriptsintheCustomSettings.iniFile"></a> User Exit Scripts in the CustomSettings.ini File  
 A user exit script is effectively a function library that can be called during the processing of the CustomSettings.ini file using the **UserExit** directive. A user exit script contains one or more functions that can be called during the process of the CustomSettings.ini file.  

 A user exit script is called by specifying the **UserExit** directive and assigning the property name of the script to be called—for example, **UserExit=TrimAssetTag.vbs**. A function within the user exit script is called by specifying the name of a function enclosed in the **#** characters. For example, if the user exit script contains a function called **TrimAssetTag()**, it would be called by specifying **#TrimAssetTag()#**.  

 Parameters can be passed to the function in the user exit script in the usual way by specifying the parameter while calling the function. For example, to pass the variable **%ASSETTAG%** to the function **TrimAssetTag()**, the function would be called by specifying **#TrimAssetTag("%ASSETTAG%")#**.  

 The value returned by the function can be assigned to a variable by assigning the function to that variable. For example, to take the asset tag of a computer and trim it using the function **TrimAssetTag()**, and to then reassign the trimmed asset tag to the variable **AssetTag**, the CustomSettings.ini file would read **AssetTag=#TrimAssetTag("%ASSETTAG%")#**.  

 An example of how this could be used is to determine the task sequence to be run based on a rule that sets the **TaskSequenceID** property. Listing 3 is an example user exit script that determines the task sequence to be run based on the amount of available RAM. This script also uses the **ZTIUtility** logging class.  

 **Listing 3. Example User Exit Script**  

```  
Function UserExit(sType, sWhen, sDetail, bSkip)  
  UserExit = Success  
End Function  

Function SetTaskSequence(vMemory)  

  oLogging.CreateEntry "UserExit - Determining Task " & _  
    "Sequence to run based on available RAM", LogTypeInfo  

  If vMemory <= 2048 Then  
    SetTaskSequence = "Win7_X86"  
    oLogging.CreateEntry "UserExit - Available RAM: " & _  
      vMemory & ". Selecting Win7_X86 TS.", LogTypeInfo  
  Else  
    SetTaskSequence = "Win8_X86"  
    oLogging.CreateEntry "UserExit - Available RAM: " & _  
      vMemory & ". Selecting Win8_X86 TS.", LogTypeInfo  
  End If  
End Function  

```  

 The user exit script should be placed in the Scripts folder on the deployment share (for example, D:\Production Deployment Share\Scripts).  

###### To create the user exit script  

1. Create and test the custom script to be used.  

2. Locate the MDT Scripts folder (for example, D:\Production Deployment Share\Scripts).  

3. Copy the custom script to the Scripts folder.  

   With the user exit script added to the deployment share (in this case, Z*-RAMTest.wsf*), it must then be referenced in the CustomSettings.ini file for the deployment share so it is called during deployment.  

###### To call the user exit script from CustomSettings.ini  

1. Click **Start**, and then point to **All Programs**. Point to **Microsoft Deployment Toolkit**, and then click **Deployment Workbench**.  

2. In the Deployment Workbench console tree, go to Deployment Workbench/Deployment Shares/*deployment_share* (where *deployment_share* is the name of the deployment share to configure).  

3. In the Actions pane, click **Properties**.  

4. Click the **Rules** tab to display the CustomSettings.ini file.  

5. Add sections to UserExit.vbs to call the required functionality using the principles described in the previous section. An example CustomSetting.ini file is shown in Listing 4.  

6. Click **OK** to submit the changes.  

7. In the details pane, click *deployment_share* (where *deployment_share* is the name of the deployment share to configure).  

8. In the Actions pane, click **Update Deployment Share**.  

    The Update Deployment Share Wizard starts.  

9. On the **Options** page, select **Optimize the boot image updating process**, and then click **Next**.  

10. On the **Summary** page, verify the details are correct, and then click **Next**.  

11. On the **Confirmation** page, click **Finish**.  

    Another common use for the user exit script is to dynamically set the computer name from known MDT properties such as **SerialNumber**, **Model**, or **Product**.  

    **Listing 4. Example CustomSettings.ini for Calling the User Exit Script**  

```  
[Settings]  
Priority=Default  

[Default]  
OSInstall=Y  
TaskSequenceID=#SetTaskSequence("%MEMORY%")#  
UserExit=Z-RAMTest.vbs  

UserDataLocation=NONE  
SkipCapture=YES  
SkipAdminPassword=NO  
SkipProductKey=YES  

```  

####  <a name="BasicCustomSettings.iniFileforLTIDeployments"></a> Basic CustomSettings.ini File for LTI Deployments  
 For LTI deployments, the Deployment Workbench uses a template version of the CustomSettings.ini file (stored in *installation_folder*\Templates, where *installation_folder* is the folder in which MDT is installed) as a basis for a customized version of CustomSettings.ini. The template version of the CustomSettings.ini file is illustrated in Listing 5. The template version in Listing 5 does not contain sufficient settings to successfully deploy Windows to a target computer. However, the file will be further customized using the Deployment Workbench.  

 **Listing 5. Unmodified CustomSettings.ini File in the Templates Folder**  

```  
[Settings]  
Priority=Default  
Properties=MyCustomProperty  

[Default]  
OSInstall=Y  
ScanStateArgs=/v:5 /o /c  
LoadStateArgs=/v:5 /c /lac  
```  

 The New Deployment Share Wizard in the Deployment Workbench modifies this template of the CustomSettings.ini file based on the responses provided. Listing 6 shows the customized version of the CustomSettings.ini file after completing the New Deployment Share Wizard.  

 **Listing 6. Customized CustomSettings.ini File Modified by the Deployment Workbench**

```  

 The CustomSettings.ini file in Listing 6 contains the property values for all the target computers to be migrated using this version of the file. This version of the file contains no values unique to a specific target computer. For LTI, the target computer–specific configuration values are manually provided during the installation process.  

  Table 153 explains the properties and corresponding values used in Listing 6.

####  <a name="BasicCustomSettings.iniFileforZTIDeploymentsUsingConfigurationManger"></a> Basic CustomSettings.ini File for ZTI Deployments Using Configuration Manger  
 For ZTI deployments using Configuration Manager, the Deployment Workbench uses a template version of the CustomSettings.ini file (stored in *installation_folder*\Templates, where *installation_folder* is the folder in which MDT is installed) as a basis for a customized version of CustomSettings.ini. The template version of the CustomSettings.ini file is illustrated in Listing 7. The template version in Listing 7 does not contain sufficient settings to successfully deploy Windows to a target computer. However, the file will be further customized using the Deployment Workbench.  

 **Listing 7. Unmodified CustomSettings.ini File in the Templates Folder**  

```

```  

 The CustomSettings.ini file shown in Listing 8 contains the property values for all of the target computers to be deployed using this version of the file. This version of the file contains no values that are unique to a specific target computer.  

 For ZTI using Configuration Manager, the Create MDT Task Sequence Wizard copies an unmodified version of the CustomSettings.ini template with no modifications to the file. Modify the version of the template in the package source folder that you specified in **Package source to be created** on the **MDT Package** wizard page in the Create MDT Task Sequence Wizard as described in [Create ZTI Task Sequences Using the Create MDT Task Sequence Wizard in Configuration Manager](#CreateZTITaskSequencesUsingtheCreateMDTTaskSequenceWizardinConfigurationManager).  

 Modify this version of the CustomSettings.ini file to include the target computer–specific configuration values. After modifying the file, update the distribution points for the Microsoft Deployment Files package so that the changes are available to the task sequences. Listing 9 shows a modified version of the CustomSettings.ini file, which includes target computer–specific settings.

 For more information on the individual properties, see the corresponding reference section in the MDT document *Toolkit Reference*.  

####  <a name="IdentifytheBootStrap.iniFileSyntax"></a> Identify the BootStrap.ini File Syntax  
 In LTI deployments, use the BootStrap.ini file to specify property settings before accessing the CustomSettings.ini file. Use the BootStrap.ini file to provide distribution point information, logon credentials, and Windows PE keyboard locale settings. The properties configured in BootStrap.ini help the MDT scripts locate the appropriate MDT distribution share.  

 The syntax of the BootStrap.ini file is identical to the CustomSettings.ini file. The BootStrap.ini file contains a subset of the properties used in CustomSettings.ini as follows:  

- `DeployRoot`  

  > [!NOTE]
  >  Ensure that the **DeployRoot** property is specified in the BootStrap.ini file, as the LTI deployment process will not be able to locate the CustomSettings.ini file in the deployment share. If not configured correctly, errors and warnings are displayed when running the Deployment Wizard.  

- `SkipBDDWelcome`  

- `UserDomain`  

- `UserID`  

- `UserPassword`  

- `KeyboardLocale`  

  For more information about each of these properties, see the corresponding section in the MDT document *Toolkit Reference*.  

  The Deployment Workbench creates the BootStrap.ini file when you create a deployment share. After the initial creation, make all further customizations manually.  

  Listing 10 shows the BootStrap.ini file that the Deployment Workbench creates automatically for a deployment share. You may need to customize the BootStrap.ini file in Listing 10.  

  **Listing 10. BootStrap.ini File As Created by the Deployment Workbench for Deployment Shares**  

```  
[Settings]  
Priority=Default  

[Default]  
DeployRoot=\\NYC-MDT-01\Distribution$  
```  

###  <a name="ConfiguringtheAppropriateMDTProperties"></a> Configuring the Appropriate MDT Properties  
 MDT uses wizards to create and manage configuration files. For more information about the standard MDT configuration files, CustomSettings.ini and BootStrap.ini, see [Customizing MDT Configuration Files](#CustomizingMDTConfigurationFiles). However, you can customize configuration files to meet the needs of your organization.  

 Before configuring the deployment process, select the properties to reference from the predefined or user-defined properties. The properties selected must include all the configuration settings to be supplied during the deployment process.  

 For ZTI deployments using Configuration Manager, provide all configuration settings required to deploy the target operating system. For LTI deployments, provide a subset of the configuration settings that are provided automatically; the remainder of the settings can be provided manually during the deployment process.  

 The MDT process occurs in the phases defined in the TS.xml file. The Task Sequencer parses the TS.xml file to identify the appropriate sequence for performing the deployment process. The phases defined in the TS.xml file include:  

- **Validate Phase**. Performs validation checks to make sure that the operating system installation can proceed; specifically blocks installation on server operating systems.  

- **State Capture Phase**. Gathers information from the configuration file, databases, and the local machine to determine how the image installation process should proceed, including whether there is enough space to do a local USMT state backup. The scripts also invoke the USMT Scanstate.exe command as appropriate.  

- **Preinstall Phase**. Confirms that the necessary information has been gathered in the State Capture Phase for the Refresh Computer scenario. In the New Computer and Replace Computer scenarios, the script gathers the necessary information in this phase, because these scenarios do not perform the State Capture Phase. Also, a backup of the computer can be optionally performed for the Refresh Computer scenario.  

- **Install Phase**. Installs the target operating system on the target computers.  

- **Post Install Phase**. Updates the Unattend.xml with information gathered in the previous custom actions based on the operating system being deployed.  

- **State Restore Phase**. Invokes the USMT Loadstate.exe command to restore the user state that was previously backed up.  

  The TS.xml file identifies the appropriate steps in each phase based on each type of deployment scenario (Refresh Computer, Replace Computer, and New Computer). Select the properties required during each phase of the deployment process.  

  For more information on each of the properties used in each phase, see the section, "Properties", in the MDT document *Toolkit Reference*.  

###  <a name="ApplyingMDTPropertiestoGroupsofComputers"></a> Applying MDT Properties to Groups of Computers  
 Whenever possible, use group-based rules to apply most computer configuration settings. Group-based rules allow the same configuration settings to be applied to a group of client computers. After applying group-based rules, you can supply computer-specific configuration settings using computer-based rules.  

 Apply properties to groups of computers by performing the following steps:  

1.  Select the method of grouping multiple computers as described in [Select the Method for Grouping Computers](#SelecttheMethodforGroupingComputers).  

2.  Apply the properties to the groupings of computers as described in [Apply the Properties to the Groups](#ApplythePropertiestotheGroups).  

####  <a name="SelecttheMethodforGroupingComputers"></a> Select the Method for Grouping Computers  
 Different methods can be used to group client computers. After determining how to group the computers, select the appropriate properties to help group them.  

 Using the processing rules in MDT, group computers based on any property that might be applied to a group of computers (such as **Make**, **Model**, or **DefaultGateway**).  Table 155 lists methods of grouping computers, a description of the method, and the properties that can be used to group the computers.  

### Table 155. Methods for Grouping Computers  

|Grouping method|Description|Properties|  
|---------------------|-----------------|----------------|  
|Geographically|Group configuration settings based on resources located within a geographic region (such as a shared folder on a computer within a geographic region).|**DefaultGateway** |  
|Target computer hardware attributes|Group configuration settings based on hardware attributes (such as the make of the computer or processor architecture of the target computer).|**Architecture**CapableArchitectureMake|  
|Target computer software attributes|Group configuration settings based on hardware attributes (such as the operating system version of the target computer).|**OSVersion** |  
|Default attributes|Apply configuration settings to all target computers when the properties are not in other sections.|**Default** |  

 In most instances, computer groupings can be nested. For example, you can use the **DefaultGateway** property to designate the IP subnets on which a computer resides within a geographic location. Define locations using the user-defined properties in the `[DefaultGateway]` section, as shown in Listing 11.  

> [!NOTE]
>  A variety of methods can be used to group computers by hardware configuration, and the script will search for the substituted value regardless. For instance, if you specify `Priority=Make`, the script substitutes the value for **Make** that it determines through a Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) call and will look for the corresponding section—for example, `[Dell Computer Corporation]`.  

 **Example: Computer Groupings Selected by Woodgrove Bank**  

  Listing 11 shows an example of how the fictional company, Woodgrove Bank, used `[DefaultGateway]` to designate the configuration settings for a specific location. Three subnets (172.16.0.3, 172.16.1.3, and 172.16.2.3) reside within the NYC location. A separate section, `[NYC]`, includes the configuration settings specific to the NYC location. Similar sections exist for the DALLAS and WASHINGTON locations. This is a special case that allows multiple default gateways to point to the same section. In many environments, a one-to-one mapping might be expected between the `[DefaultGateway]` section and a corresponding section.  

 **Listing 11. Using [DefaultGateway] to Designate Location-Specific Configuration Settings**  

```  
[Settings]  
Priority=DefaultGateway  

[DefaultGateway]  
172.16.0.3=NYC  
172.16.1.3=NYC  
172.16.2.3=NYC  
172.16.111.3=DALLAS  
172.16.112.3=DALLAS  
172.16.116.3=WASHINGTON  
172.16.117.3=WASHINGTON

UDShare=\\DAL-AM-FIL-01\MigData  
SLShare=\\DAL-AM-FIL-01\Logs  
Administrator1=WOODGROVEBANK\DAL Help Desk Staff  
```  

####  <a name="ApplythePropertiestotheGroups"></a> Apply the Properties to the Groups  
 After identifying how to group configuration settings, determine which properties and corresponding configuration settings to apply to each group. Properties that can be grouped are those you can apply to multiple computers.  

 Some examples of properties that are typically applied to groups of computers include:  

- **BackupDir**  

- **BackupShare**  

- **CaptureGroups**  

- **ComputerBackupLocation**  

- **Packages**  

- **SLShare**  

- **UDDir**  

- **UDShare**  

- **UDProfiles**  

  Properties that are not applied to groups of computers are those specific to a particular computer. Examples of properties that are not appropriate to apply to groups of computers include:  

- **OSDAdapter0IPAddress**  

- **OSDNewMachineName**  

  **Example: Group-based Configuration Settings Selected by Woodgrove Bank**  

  Listing 11 showed an example in which Woodgrove Bank selects group-based configuration settings:  

- In the NYC and DALLAS locations, `UDShare`, `SLShare`, and `Administrator1` are specified for each location.  

- The servers that `UDShare` and `SLSShare` (`NYC-AM-FIL-01` and`DAL-AM-FIL-01`) reference are within each respective location.  

- The Administrator accounts that `Administrator1` (`WOODGROVEBANK\NYC Help Desk Staff` and `WOODGROVEBANK\DAL Help Desk Staff`) reference are unique to each respective location.  

- In NYC, location-specific packages are designated by `Packages1` and `Packages2`.  

###  <a name="ApplyingMDTPropertiestoIndividualComputers"></a> Applying MDT Properties to Individual Computers  
 After determining the groupings of target computers and configuration settings to be applied to each group, determine the method for identifying individual computers and the configuration settings to assign to each computer. The rules for target computers allow the override or augmentation of group-based processing rules based on the priority of the computer-based rules.  

 For more information about determining the priority of processing rules, see [Priority Reserved Property](#PriorityReservedProperty), earlier in this guide.  

 Whenever possible, use group-based rules for most client computer configuration settings. Group-based rules allow the same configuration settings to be applied to a group of computers. After applying group-based rules, you can apply computer-specific configuration settings using computer-based rules.  

 As when grouping computers, more than one method is available for identifying individual computers. After selecting the method for identifying an individual target computer, select the appropriate properties.  

 The processing rules allow the identification of computers based on any property that you might apply to an individual of computer (such as **AssetTag**, **MACAddress**, **UUID**, and so on).  

  Table 156 lists the methods of identifying individual computers, a description of the method, and the properties that you can use to identify the individual computers.  

### Table 156. Methods for Identifying Individual Computers  

|Identification method|Description|Properties|  
|---------------------------|-----------------|----------------|  
|Target computer hardware attributes|Identify the target computer using the hardware configuration.|**AssetTag**, **MACAddress**, **SerialNumber**, **UUID**, **Product**, **Make**, and **Model** |  
|Target computer software attributes|Identify the target computer using the software or firmware configuration.|**OSVersion**, **IsServerOS**, and **OSSKU** |  
|Target computer user-defined attributes|Identify the target computer using attributes that are assigned to the computer but not part of the hardware or software configuration.|**AssetTag SerialNumber** |  

 **Example: Computer Identification Method Selected by Woodgrove**  

  Listing 12 shows an example of how Woodgrove Bank identified computer-based configuration settings. In this instance, Woodgrove used the MAC address of the computer to identify the corresponding configuration settings for the computer (for example, `00:03:FF:CB:4E:C2`and`00:0F:20:35:DE:AC`). The configuration settings for each computer are listed immediately after the section that corresponds to the computer's MAC address.  

 **Listing 12. How Woodgrove Identified Client Computers**  

```  
[00:03:FF:CB:4E:C2]  
ComputerName=WasW2K  
OverRideProductKey=TTTTT-VVVVV-WWWWW-XXXXX-YYYYY  

[00:0F:20:35:DE:AC]  
ComputerName=HPD530-1  
OverRideProductKey=AAAAA-BBBBB-CCCCC-DDDDD-EEEEE

OverRideProductKey=11111-22222-33333-44444-55555  
```  

 **Example: Computer-based Configuration Settings Selected by Woodgrove**  

  Listing 12 also shows the computer-based configuration settings that Woodgrove Bank selected. Table 157 lists the computer-specific configuration settings applied to each computer.  

### Table 157. Woodgrove Client Computers and the Corresponding Configuration Settings  

|Target computer|Settings and description|  
|---------------------|------------------------------|  
|`[00:03:FF:CB:4E:C2]`|`ComputerName` is the name of the computer after deployment—in this case, WasW2K.`OverRideProductKey` is the product key to be assigned to the computer—in this case, TTTTT-VVVVV-WWWWW-XXXXX-YYYYY.|  
|`[00:0F:20:35:DE:AC]`|`ComputerName` is the name of the computer after deployment—in this case, HPD530-1.`OverRideProductKey` is the product key to be assigned to the computer—in this case, AAAAA-BBBBB-CCCCC-DDDDD-EEEEE.|  
|`[00:03:FF:FE:FF:FF]`|`ComputerName` is the name of the computer after deployment—in this case, BVMXP.<br /><br /> `OverRideProductKey` is the product key to be assigned to the computer—in this case, 11111-22222-33333-44444-55555.|  

###  <a name="ConfiguringMDTProcessingRules"></a> Configuring MDT Processing Rules  
 MDT scripts configure computer settings based on rules and configuration settings stored in the CustomSettings.ini file or in the MDT DB. Configure the MDT processing rules by completing the following tasks:  

-   Configure the processing rules as described in [Configure the Rules in the CustomSettings.ini File](#ConfiguretheRulesintheCustomSettings.iniFile).  

-   Configure the processing rules as described in [Configure the Rules in the MDT DB](#ConfiguretheRulesintheMDTDB).  

####  <a name="ConfiguretheRulesintheCustomSettings.iniFile"></a> Configure the Rules in the CustomSettings.ini File  
 Configure rules in the CustomSettings.ini file. The template version of the CustomSettings.ini file, along with the organization's rules, becomes the customized CustomSettings.ini file.  

 For LTI deployments, configuring group-based settings might be sufficient, because computer-specific settings can be provided during the MDT installation process. For ZTI deployments using Configuration Manager, add configuration settings unique to a specific client computer, because ZTI assumes that all configuration settings necessary for deployment are configured in advance. These configuration settings can be in addition to or instead of the group-based rules.  

####  <a name="ConfiguretheRulesintheMDTDB"></a> Configure the Rules in the MDT DB  
 Use the Deployment Workbench to configure the rules for LTI and ZTI deployments in the MDT DB. The benefits of using the MDT DB include:  

- **It has a more generic version of CustomSettings.ini**. Storing the configuration settings in the MDT DB removes most of the detail from the CustomSettings.ini file. This change helps make the CustomSettings.ini file more generic so that you can use the same file in multiple deployment shares.  

- **It is a centralized repository for all property configuration settings**. Centralizing the configuration for all property settings ensures consistency across all deployment shares.  

  For information about the MDT DB and using it to perform deployments, see [Performing Deployments Using the MDT DB](#PerformingDeploymentsUsingtheMDTDB).  

###  <a name="PreparingDisksonTargetComputers"></a> Preparing Disks on Target Computers  
 Prior to deploying the target operating system on a target computer, the MDT deployment process prepares the disks on the target computer for deployment. The disk-preparation process includes the following steps:  

1. Create partitions on one or more drives on the target computers.  

2. Format one or more partitions on the target computers.  

3. Prepare the disks on the target computers for BitLocker.  

   Disk preparation occurs during the State Capture and Preinstall phases in the MDT deployment process. The disk-preparation step completed in the State Capture Phase is the disabling of BitLocker on the target computer. The disk-preparation steps completed in the Preinstall Phase create and format the partitions on the target computer.  

##### To prepare the disks on target computers in MDT  

1.  Review the default partition configuration created by MDT as described in [Review the Default Partition Configuration Created by MDT](#ReviewtheDefaultPartitionConfigurationCreatedbyMDT).  

2.  Prepare for deployment to virtual hard disks (VHDs) with native boot as described in [Prepare for Deployment to Virtual Hard Disks with Native Boot](#PrepareforDeploymenttoVirtualHardDiskswithNativeBoot).  

3.  Configure task sequence steps based on the Create Virtual Hard Disk task sequence step type as described in [Configure the Create VHD Disk Task Sequence Step Type](#ConfiguretheCreateVHDDiskTaskSequenceStepType).  

4.  Deploy to computers that support the Unified Extensible Firmware Interface specification as described in [Deploy to Computers with UEFI](#DeploytoComputerswithUEFI).  

5.  Review the task sequence steps used for saving and restoring user state information as described in [Configure Disk Preparation Task Sequence Steps](#ConfigureDiskPreparationTaskSequenceSteps).  

6.  Configure the MDT properties used in saving and restoring user state information as described in [Configure Disk Preparation Properties](#ConfigureDiskPreparationProperties).  

####  <a name="ReviewtheDefaultPartitionConfigurationCreatedbyMDT"></a> Review the Default Partition Configuration Created by MDT  
 The MDT deployment processes automatically create the necessary disk partitions to take full advantage of the features provided by the target computer and operating system. By default, MDT creates the partition configuration for BIOS-based computers as described in Table 158.  

### Table 158. Default Partition Configuration Created by MDT for BIOS-based Computers  

|Partition|File system|Size|Description|  
|---------------|-----------------|----------|-----------------|  
|BDEDrive|NTFS|512 MB|Unencrypted partition used for starting Windows, also known as the *system partition*. This partition is used to initially start Windows until BitLocker is loaded and the operating system drive can be read. This partition can also be shared with the recovery partition.|  
|OSDisk|NTFS|Remaining space|Partition on which Windows is located, also known as the *operating system drive*. If BitLocker is used, this is the partition that is encrypted.|  

 By default, MDT creates the partition configuration for UEFI-based computers as described in Table 159.  

### Table 159. Default Partition Configuration Created by MDT for UEFI-based Computers  

|Partition|File system|Size|Description|  
|---------------|-----------------|----------|-----------------|  
|Description|FAT32|512 MB|Unencrypted partition used for starting Windows. For more information, see [Deploy to Computers with UEFI](#DeploytoComputerswithUEFI). This partition can also be shared with the recovery partition.|  
|MSR|Unformatted|128 MB|The *Microsoft Reserved Partition* (MSR) is a partition on a data storage device that is labeled with a GUID equal to E3C9E316-0B5C-4DB8-817D-F92DF00215AE. The containing storage device has to use the new GUID Partition Table (GPT) format, not the traditional master boot record (MBR) partition table format.An MSR partition is required on every GPT disk and should be created as the disk is initially partitioned. It should be located after the EFI System Partition (ESP) and any OEM service partitions, but—most importantly—the first data partition must immediately follow it.|  
|OSDisk|NTFS|Remaining space|Partition on which Windows is located, also known as the *operating system drive*. If BitLocker is used, this is the partition that is encrypted.|  

 In addition to the default MDT partition configurations, you can create custom partition configurations. For example, the default MDT partition configurations do not include other utility partitions or recovery images. For more information, see [Understanding Disk Partitions](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dd799232\(WS.10\).aspx).  

####  <a name="PrepareforDeploymenttoVirtualHardDiskswithNativeBoot"></a> Prepare for Deployment to Virtual Hard Disks with Native Boot  
 Native boot allows VHDs to run on a computer without a VM or hypervisor.  

> [!NOTE]
>  Only LTI supports deployment to VHDs with native boot.  

 Native VHD boot has the following dependencies:  

- The local disk must have at least two partitions: a system partition that contains the Windows boot environment files and Boot Configuration Data (BCD) store and a partition to store the VHD file.  

- The local disk partition that contains the VHD file must have enough free disk space for expanding a dynamic VHD to its maximum size and for the page file created when booting the VHD. The page file is created outside of the VHD file, unlike in a VM, where the page file is contained inside the VHD.  

  You can create LTI task sequences based on the following LTI task sequence templates to deploy to VHDs with native boot:  

1. **Deploy to VHD Client Task Sequence**. Select this LTI task sequence template to deploy Windows in a VHD with native boot.  

2. **Deploy to VHD Server Task Sequence**. Select this LTI task sequence template to deploy Windows Server in a VHD with native boot.  

   These tasks sequences contain the following task sequence steps, which are used to perform deployment to VHDs:  

- **Create VHD Disk**. The step creates the VHD file after the physical partition has been created and formatted. For more information about this task sequence step, see [Configure the Create VHD Disk Task Sequence Step Type](#ConfiguretheCreateVHDDiskTaskSequenceStepType).  

- **Format and Partition VHD**. This step formats the .vhd file and is built using the **Format and Partition Disk** task sequence step type. For more information about task sequence step type, see [Configure Disk Preparation Task Sequence Steps](#ConfigureDiskPreparationTaskSequenceSteps).  

- **Clear OSDDiskIndexVariable**. This step clears the **OSDDiskIndexVariable** task sequence variable that was set during the **Create VHD Disk** task sequence step. Clearing the **OSDDiskIndexVariable** task sequence variable allows other disks to be partitioned and formatted as a part of the task sequence.  

  For more information about VHDs with native boot, see [Understanding Virtual Hard Disks with Native Boot](/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-8.1-and-8/hh825689(v=win.10)).  

####  <a name="ConfiguretheCreateVHDDiskTaskSequenceStepType"></a> Configure the Create VHD Disk Task Sequence Step Type  
 The **Create VHD Disk** task sequence step type creates a .vhd file in preparation to performing a deployment to a VHD with native boot support. Table 160 describes how to configure the **Create VHD Disk** task sequence step type.  

### Table 160. Configure Create VHD Disk Task Sequence Step Type  

|Setting|Description|  
|-------------|-----------------|  
|VHD filename path| Specifies the path to the folder where the .vhd file will be created and can contain one of the following value:<br /><br /> -                              **Random**. This value specifies that the task sequence step will automatically create a unique folder and .vhd file name. The task sequence step automatically places the .vhd file in the folder.<br /><br /> -                              ***vhd_path***. In this case, *vhd_path* is the path to the folder where you want the task sequence step to create the .vhd file, including the name of the .vhd file.<br /><br /> The default value for this setting is **Random**.|  
|Diff filename|Specifies the file name for a differencing VHD file:<br /><br /> -                              **Random**. This value specifies that the task sequence step will automatically create a unique folder and file name for the differencing .vhd file.<br /><br /> -                              ***vhd_path***. In this case, *vhd_path* is the path to the folder where you want the task sequence step to create the differencing .vhd file, including the name of the .vhd file.<br /><br /> -                              ***Blank***. In this case, no differencing .vhd file is created.<br /><br /> The default value for this setting is **blank**, which indicates that no differencing .vhd file is created.|  
|VHD size|Specifies the capacity of the .vhd file, which can be specified in megabytes or as a percentage of the available disk space.|  
|Dynamically expanding|This option creates a dynamically expanding .vhd file, which will physically increase in size as more data is stored in the .vhd file. The other option is **Fixed size**. This setting is the default selection.|  
|Fixed size|This option creates a fixed sized .vhd file, which is created as the size specified in VHD size and does not automatically grow in size. The other option is **Dynamically expanding**, which is the default selection.|  
|Retrieve the destination drive for the VHD file from a variable|This specifies the task sequence variable name used to designate the destination drive for the task sequence variable. You can specify any valid task sequence variable in this setting. The default value is the **VHDTargetDisk** task sequence variable. For more information on the **VHDTargetDisk** task sequence variable, see the **VHDTargetDisk** property in the in the MDT document *Toolkit Reference*.|  
|Assign the disk index created from the VHD to a variable|This setting specifies the task sequence variable name used to designate the disk index to be used in deploying the operating system. You can specify any valid task sequence variable in this setting. The default value is the **OSDDiskIndex** task sequence variable. For more information on the **OSDDiskIndex** task sequence variable, see the **OSDDiskIndex** property in the in the MDT document *Toolkit Reference*.|  

####  <a name="DeploytoComputerswithUEFI"></a> Deploy to Computers with UEFI  
 The UEFI is a specification that defines a software interface between an operating system and platform firmware. UEFI is a more secure replacement for the older BIOS firmware interface, present in some personal computers, which is vulnerable to malware that performs attacks during startup or power on self-test (POST) processes.  

 Windows operating systems support firmware revisions that are based on the UEFI version 2.0 or later specification on 64-bit platforms and Intel Itanium platforms. Windows also supports firmware revisions that are based on the EFI Version 1.10 specification on Intel Itanium platforms.  

 Windows supports a subset of the functionality that is defined in the UEFI 2.0 specification. Windows implementations do not explicitly check against higher revisions of the firmware. The operating system supports higher revisions of the firmware if they contain the necessary support for Windows.  

> [!NOTE]
>  The UEFI partitions must be formatted using the FAT32 file system. The NTFS file system is not supported for UEFI boot.  

 By default, MDT creates the appropriate partitions to support UEFI. If you create custom partition configurations, ensure that you follow the recommendations described in the [Review the Default Partition Configuration Created by MDT](#ReviewtheDefaultPartitionConfigurationCreatedbyMDT) section.  

 For more information, see the following resources:  

-   [UEFI Support and Requirements for Windows Operating Systems](/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-8.1-and-8/hh824898(v=win.10))

###  <a name="SavingandRestoringUserStateInformation"></a> Saving and Restoring User State Information  
 User state information consists of the user profile information, Internet Explorer favorites, data files, and other user-specific data stored on the target computer. The MDT deployment process can automatically capture and restore user state information on the target computers.  

 The MDT deployment process uses USMT to save and restore user state information. During the State Capture Phase in the MDT deployment process, USMT saves the user state information to a desired location. Later, during the State Restore Phase, USMT restores this user state information.  

##### To save and restore user state information on target computers in MDT  

1.  Review the task sequence steps used for saving and restoring user state information as described in [Review User State Information Task Sequence Steps](#ReviewUserStateInformationTaskSequenceSteps).  

2.  Configure the MDT properties used in saving and restoring user state information as described in [Configure User State Information Properties](#ConfigureUserStateInformationProperties).  

3.  Customize the USMT XML control files as described in [Configure User State Migration XML Control Files](#ConfigureUserStateMigrationXMLControlFiles).  

4.  Configure MDT to perform user state capture in Windows PE (offline) or in the existing operating system (online) as described in [Configure USMT Offline User State Migration](#ConfigureUSMTOfflineUserStateMigration).  

####  <a name="ReviewUserStateInformationTaskSequenceSteps"></a> Review User State Information Task Sequence Steps  
 MDT includes task sequence templates for LTI and ZTI deployments for Configuration Manager. These task sequence templates include the task sequence steps listed in Table 163, which are used to save and restore user state information.  

### Table 163. User State Information Task Sequence Steps

 USMT uses the default versions of the migration XML files unless the path to the custom XML control files is indicated. Customize the user state migration XML control files for USMT by performing the following tasks:  

-   Configure the XML control files for USMT for LTI deployments as described in [Configure User State Migration XML Control Files for LTI Deployments](#ConfigureUserStateMigrationXMLControlFilesforLTIDeployments).  

-   Configure the XML control files for USMT for ZTI deployments as described in [Configure User State Migration XML Control Files for ZTI Deployments](#ConfigureUserStateMigrationXMLControlFilesforZTIDeployments).  

#####  <a name="ConfigureUserStateMigrationXMLControlFilesforLTIDeployments"></a> Configure User State Migration XML Control Files for LTI Deployments  
 For LTI deployments, insert one or more lines in the CustomSettings.ini file that contain the **USMTMigFiles** property for each of the USMT migration XML control files that you want to specify. The XML files need to be copied into either the USMT folder or the Scripts folder in the distribution share.  

 Use the following format for these lines:  

```  
USMTMigFiles1=MigApp.xml  
USMTMigFiles2=MigUser.xml  
USMTMigFiles3=MigSys.xml  
USMTMigFiles4=MigCustom.xml  
USMTConfigFile=Config.xml  
```  

> [!NOTE]
>  See the MDT document *Toolkit Reference* for details on configuration settings.  

#####  <a name="ConfigureUserStateMigrationXMLControlFilesforZTIDeployments"></a> Configure User State Migration XML Control Files for ZTI Deployments  
 For ZTI deployments for Configuration Manager, insert a line in the CustomSettings.ini file that contains the **OSDMigrateConfigFiles** task sequence variable for the USMT migration XML control file that you want to specify. If you specify the **OSDMigrateConfigFiles** property, insert another line that sets the **OSDMigrateMode** task sequence variable to Advanced.  

 Use the following format for these lines:  

```  
OSDMigrateMode=Advanced  
OSDMigrateConfigFiles=MigApp.xml,MigUser.xml  
```  

 The path to the XML control files is relative to the current folder, which will be the location of the USMT package. If you keep the XML control files in the USMT package, update this package each time you modify any of the XML control files. Otherwise, you can store the XML control files in a separate package or network shared folder and specify a fully qualified UNC path to the package or network shared folder.  

####  <a name="ConfigureUSMTOfflineUserStateMigration"></a> Configure USMT Offline User State Migration  
 USMT can perform offline migration of user state from a computer. In an offline migration, the capture is performed in Windows PE instead of the existing operating system. The advantages of performing an offline user state migration are:  

- You do not need to log on to the computer on which you are capturing user state.  

- Hardware resources and files are more readily accessible by ScanState and other USMT tools.  

- Performance may increase on older computers that have limited hardware resources and numerous software applications.  

- Doing so may help avoid conflicts where a file is in use by another application or service.  

- You may be able to use an offline migration to recover files and settings if a computer no longer starts properly.  

  The disadvantage of performing an offline user state migration is that some user settings are not captured but rather can only be captured while running USMT in the target operating system. For a list of the settings that are not captured when performing an offline user state capture, see [What Does USMT Migrate?](/previous-versions/windows/hh825238(v=win.10))  

  You can perform USMT offline user state migration in the MDT:  

- In a Refresh Computer deployment scenario using LTI, ZTI, or UDI when the value of the **USMTOfflineMigration** property is set to **"TRUE"**  

- In a New Computer deployment scenario using LTI with the **Move Data and Settings** wizard page in the **Deployment Wizard** or if the value of the **USMTOfflineMigration** property is set to **"TRUE"**  

> [!NOTE]
>  You cannot perform USMT offline user state migration in the MDT New Computer deployment scenario using ZTI.8  

###  <a name="JoiningTargetComputerstoADDSDomains"></a> Joining Target Computers to AD DS Domains  
 One of the final steps in completing the deployment of a target operating system to the target computers is joining the computer to an AD DS domain. Although you can complete this process manually, MDT supports the following automated methods for joining target computers to AD DS domains:  

-   Using the Deployment Wizard as described in [Join Domains Using the Deployment Wizard](#JoinDomainsUsingtheDeploymentWizard)  

-   Modifying CustomSettings.ini as described in [Join Domains by Modifying the CustomSettings.ini File](#JoinDomainsbyModifyingtheCustomSettings.iniFile)  

-   Modifying Unattended.xml as described in [Join Domains by Modifying the Unattended.xml File](#JoinDomainsbyModifyingtheUnattended.xmlFile)  

-   Using the **Recover from Domain Join Failure** task sequence step type as described in [Join Domains Using the Recover from Domain Join Failure Task Sequence Step Type](#JoinDomainsUsingtheRecoverfromDomainJoinFailureTaskSequenceStepType)  

-   Using the Windows offline domain join feature as described in [Join Domains Using Offline Domain Join](#JoinDomainsUsingOfflineDomainJoin)  

####  <a name="JoinDomainsUsingtheDeploymentWizard"></a> Join Domains Using the Deployment Wizard  
 For LTI deployments, the **Join the computer to a domain or workgroup** wizard page in the Windows Deploy Wizard in MDT allows you to interactively provide the configuration settings necessary to join a domain. Table 165 lists the configuration settings on this wizard page used in joining a domain.

|   **MachineObjectOU**   |                                                                                                                        The AD DS OU in the target domain in which the computer account for the target computer is created                                                                                                                        |

####  <a name="JoinDomainsbyModifyingtheUnattended.xmlFile"></a> Join Domains by Modifying the Unattended.xml File  
 You can automate the domain-join process for LTI or ZTI deployments by modifying the settings listed in Table 167 in the Unattended.xml file used in the MDT deployment process.  

### Table 167. Settings in Unattended.xml to Modify for Joining a Domain  

|Setting|Description|  
|-------------|-----------------|  
|**Username** |The user account credentials used to join the target computer to the domain specified in **JoinDomain** |  
|**Domain** |The domain in which the user's credentials specified in **Username** reside|  
|**Password** |The password used for the domain Administrator account specified in the **Username** setting to join the computer to the domain|  
|**JoinDomain** |The domain that the target computer joins after the target operating system is deployed|  
|**MachineObjectOU** |The AD DS OU in the target domain in which the computer account for the target computer is created|  

 For more information about these settings, see [Microsoft-Windows-UnattendedJoin](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/cc748842\(WS.10\).aspx).  

####  <a name="JoinDomainsUsingtheRecoverfromDomainJoinFailureTaskSequenceStepType"></a> Join Domains Using the Recover from Domain Join Failure Task Sequence Step Type  
 Task sequence steps based on the **Recover from Domain Join Failure** task sequence step type retry the domain-join process using the configuration information specified in CustomSettings.ini. You can configure the **Recover from Domain Join Failure** task sequence step type to recover using one of the following methods:  

-   **Auto Recover (Rerun Join Domain)**. This method automatically retries the domain-join process without intervention. Select this method when you want the MDT process to automatically retry the domain-join process.  

-   **Manual Recover (Allow user to Join Domain)**. This method allows the user running the Deployment Wizard to retry the domain-join process. Select this method when you want the MDT process to allow the user to retry the domain-join process.  

-   **No Recover (Stop script execution)**. This method automatically terminates the task sequence if the computer has not successfully joined the domain. Select this method when you want MDT to stop running the task sequence if the computer has not successfully joined the domain.  

    ###### To configure task sequence steps based on the Recover from Domain Join Failure task sequence step type  

    1.  Click **Start**, and then point to **All Programs**. Point to **Microsoft Deployment Toolkit**, and then click **Deployment Workbench**.  

    2.  In the Deployment Workbench console tree, go to Deployment Workbench/Deployment Shares/*deployment_share*/Task Sequences (where *deployment_share* is the name of the deployment share in which you will configure the task sequence).  

    3.  In the details pane, click ***task_sequence_name*** (where *task_sequence_name* is the name of the task sequence you want to configure).  

    4.  In the Actions pane, click **Properties**.  

         The ***task_sequence_name*** **Properties** dialog box opens (where *task_sequence_name* is the name of the task sequence you want to configure).  

    5.  On the **Task Sequence** tab, in the task sequence hierarchy, go to *task_sequence_step*, and then click the **Properties** tab.  

    6.  On the **Properties** tab, configure the settings listed in Table 168 based on the requirements of your organization, and then click **OK**.

####  <a name="JoinDomainsUsingOfflineDomainJoin"></a> Join Domains Using Offline Domain Join  
 Offline domain join is a process to join a domain without contacting a domain controller. This process makes it possible to join computers to a domain in locations where there is no connectivity to a corporate network.  

 Using offline domain join, target computers can be joined to the domain when they initially start after the installation of the target operating system. No additional restart is required to complete the domain-join process, which can significantly reduce the overall time required for wide-scale VM deployments.  

 The offline domain join is a variant on joining domains by modifying the Unattend.xml file. The Unattend.xml file includes the `Microsoft-Windows-UnattendJoin/Identification/Provisioning` section, which includes the configuration settings for performing a domain join.  

 For more information about:  

-   The offline domain join process, see Offline Domain Join (Djoin.exe) Step-by-Step Guide  

-   Configuring the Unattended.xml file to perform offline join, see the section, "Performing an offline domain join by using an unattended operating system installation," in Offline Domain Join (Djoin.exe) Step-by-Step Guide  

###  <a name="DeployingSoftwareUpdatestoTargetComputers"></a> Deploying Software Updates to Target Computers  
 In addition to the target operating system, applications, device drivers, and other software components, you may need to apply software updates to all these software components. These software updates are required to ensure a consistent configuration baseline for all the target computers.  

 Deploy software updates to target computers in MDT by:  

-   Selecting the appropriate strategies for deploying software updates as described in [Select the Software Update Deployment Strategy](#SelecttheSoftwareUpdateDeploymentStrategy)  

-   Deploying software updates using Windows Update Agent–based technologies for LTI deployments as described in [Deploy Software Updates with Windows Update Agent for LTI Deployments](#DeploySoftwareUpdateswithWindowsUpdateAgentforLTIDeployments)  

-   Deploying software updates using the Deployment Workbench for LTI deployments as described in [Deploy Software Updates with the Deployment Workbench for LTI Deployments](#DeploySoftwareUpdateswiththeDeploymentWorkbenchforLTIDeployments)  

-   Deploying software updates using Configuration Manager for ZTI deployments as described in [Deploy Software Updates with Configuration Manager for ZTI Deployments](#DeploySoftwareUpdateswithConfigurationManagerforZTIDeployments)  

####  <a name="SelecttheSoftwareUpdateDeploymentStrategy"></a> Select the Software Update Deployment Strategy  
 The software update deployment strategies are based on when the software updates are to be installed. You can install software updates:  

-   As a part of the image deployed to the target computers  

-   After the target operating system is deployed to the target computers  

####  <a name="DeploySoftwareUpdateswithWindowsUpdateAgentforLTIDeployments"></a> Deploy Software Updates with Windows Update Agent for LTI Deployments  
 In LTI deployments, you can install software updates from Windows Update or from WSUS using a task sequence step that runs the ZTIWindowsUpdate.wsf script. Some of the LTI task sequence templates provided in MDT include the **Windows Update (Pre-Application Installation)** task sequence step and the **Windows Update (Post-Application Installation)** task sequence step.  

 You can also create a custom task sequence step based on the **Run Command Line** task sequence step type that runs the following command line:  

```  
Cscript.exe "%SCRIPTROOT%\ZTIWindowsUpdate.wsf"  
```  

####  <a name="DeploySoftwareUpdateswiththeDeploymentWorkbenchforLTIDeployments"></a> Deploy Software Updates with the Deployment Workbench for LTI Deployments  
 In LTI deployments, you can install software updates for Windows in the Packages node in the Deployment Workbench using a task sequence step based on the **Install Updates Offline** task sequence step type. Some of the LTI task sequence templates provided in MDT include the **Apply Patches** task sequence step, which is based on the **Install Updates Offline** task sequence step type.  

 You can control the software updates deployed to the target computers by this method using selection profiles. The **Install Updates Offline** task sequence step allows you to specify a selection profile so that you can specify which software updates to deploy. If you want to deploy software updates based on multiple selection profiles, create a task sequence step for each selection profile, and then specify the corresponding selection profile in the task sequence step.  

 For more information on creating selection profiles, see [Create a New Selection Profile in the Deployment Workbench](#CreateaNewSelectionProfileintheDeploymentWorkbench).  

####  <a name="DeploySoftwareUpdateswithConfigurationManagerforZTIDeployments"></a> Deploy Software Updates with Configuration Manager for ZTI Deployments  
 In ZTI deployments using Configuration Manager, you can initiate software updates using a task sequence step based on the **Install Software Updates** task sequence step type. The **Install Software Updates** task sequence type allows you to install only mandatory or all software updates in a single task sequence step using one of the configuration options listed in Table 169.  

### Table 169. Configuration Settings on the Properties Tab of the Install Software Updates Type Task Sequence Step  

|Setting|Description|  
|-------------|-----------------|  
|**Name** |Configures the name of the task sequence step displayed in the task sequence hierarchy|  
|**Description** |Configures the description text for the task sequence step|  
|**Mandatory Software Updates** |Selecting configures the task sequence step to install only mandatory software updates|  
|**All Software Updates** |Selecting configures the task sequence step to install all software updates, including mandatory software updates|  

 For more information about the **Install Software Updates** task sequence type, see the section, "Install Software Updates," in the section, "Task Sequence Steps in Configuration Manager," in the Configuration Manager Documentation Library, which is installed with Configuration Manager.  

###  <a name="ManagingDeviceDrivers"></a> Managing Device Drivers  
 Device driver management is a critical component in deploying operating systems to target computers. The proper device drivers must be available to Windows PE and to the target operating system for the deployment to be successful.  

 Manage device drivers using MDT by:  

-   Selecting the appropriate strategies for managing device drivers as described in [Select the Device Driver Management Strategy](#SelecttheDeviceDriverManagementStrategy)  

-   Managing device drivers using the Deployment Workbench for LTI deployments as described in [Control Device Driver Deployments for LTI](#ControlDeviceDriverDeploymentsforLTI)  

-   Managing device drivers using Configuration Manager for ZTI deployments as described in [Control Device Driver Deployments Using Configuration Manager for ZTI](#ControlDeviceDriverDeploymentsUsingConfigurationManagerforZTI)  

-   Resolving device driver signing issues as described in [Resolve Device Driver Signing Issues](#ResolveDeviceDriverSigningIssues)  

####  <a name="SelecttheDeviceDriverManagementStrategy"></a> Select the Device Driver Management Strategy  
 The following are the high-level strategies for performing device driver management:  

- **Include all device drivers**. This is the default behavior for LTI and ZTI deployments. In this strategy, all the drivers are deployed to the target computer. Then, Windows PE and the target operating system use Plug-and-Play IDs to identify the device drivers needed for the devices on the target computers.  

- **Include only the device drivers specifically required for the target computer**. In this strategy, only the device drivers specific to the target computer are deployed to the target computer. This requires that you configure the ZTI and LTI process to control which device drivers are deployed to the target computer.  

  Table 170 lists the advantages and disadvantages of these device driver management strategies.  

### Table 170. Advantages and Disadvantages of Device Driver Management Strategies  

|Strategy|Advantages|Disadvantages|  
|--------------|----------------|-------------------|  
|Include all device drivers|- Requires less initial time and effort to identify the appropriate drivers.<br /><br /> - Works well when there are fewer device drivers to manage.|- Images are larger.<br /><br /> - Images require more frequent version updates.<br /><br /> - Ongoing management of device drivers in the image requires more effort, because there are more drivers in the image.<br /><br /> - Does not work well if there are a large number of device drivers to manage.|  
|Include only the device drivers specifically required for the target computer|- Ongoing management of device drivers in the image requires less effort, because there are fewer drivers in the image.<br /><br /> - Images are smaller.<br /><br /> - Images require less frequent version updates.<br /><br /> - Works well when there is a large number of device drivers to manage.|- Requires more initial time and effort to identify the appropriate drivers.<br /><br /> - Can introduce unnecessary management overhead when there are fewer device drivers to manage.|  

 Either of these strategies can cause problems if taken to the extreme. The "Include all device drivers" strategy might cause problems when trying to manage tens of thousands of device drivers because of the larger download sizes and a higher probability of detecting the wrong device drivers. A complex management structure used in the "Include only the device drivers specifically required for the target computer" strategy might be too complex for managing small environments with only two or three different types of computers and cause you to spend a lot of unnecessary time up front.  

 In most instances, select a device driver management strategy that is a hybrid of these strategies and best fits your organization.  

####  <a name="ControlDeviceDriverDeploymentsforLTI"></a> Control Device Driver Deployments for LTI  
 The goal of managing device drivers for LTI deployments is to help ensure that only the appropriate device drivers are deployed to the target computers without introducing unnecessary effort and management overhead. The high-level approach to device driver management using the Deployment Workbench for LTI deployments is as follows:  

1.  Create a folder structure in the Out-of-Box Drivers node of the Deployment Workbench to organize the device drivers as described in [Create Folders to Organize Device Drivers for LTI Deployments](#CreateFolderstoOrganizeDeviceDriversforLTIDeployments).  

2.  Create selection profiles used to select the device drivers for deployment based on the folder structure you created in the previous step as described in [Create Selection Profiles to Select the Device Drivers for LTI Deployments](#CreateSelectionProfilestoSelecttheDeviceDriversforLTIDeployments).  

3.  Configure tasks sequences to deploy the device drivers in the selection profiles as described in [Configure Task Sequences to Deploy Device Drivers in Selection Profiles for LTI Deployments](#ConfigureTaskSequencestoDeployDeviceDriversinSelectionProfilesforLTIDeployments).  

#####  <a name="CreateFolderstoOrganizeDeviceDriversforLTIDeployments"></a> Create Folders to Organize Device Drivers for LTI Deployments  
 Create folder structures in the Out-of-Box Drivers node in the Deployment Workbench to provide the level of control you want for deploying device drivers to target computers. The folder structure groups or categorizes device drivers so that you can select specific groupings or categories of drivers using selection profiles.  

 Select any combination of the following methods for creating folder structures:  

- **Target operating system**. Select this method to deploy only the device drivers to the target computer based on the respective target operating system.  

- **Processor architecture of the target computers**. Select this method to deploy only the device drivers to the target computers based on the respective processor architecture (32-bit or 64-bit).  

- **Manufacturer (make) and model of the target computers**. Select this method to deploy device drivers to the target computer based on the respective make and model of the target computer.  

  > [!TIP]
  >  If the name of the folder matches the value that the BIOS returned for make and model, you can select the appropriate folder structure based on task sequence variables later in the process.  

  The complexity of the folder structure that you create is based on the level of precision you want for deploying the device drivers. The more precision you want, the more complex the folder structure.  

  You can also select a method for creating folder structures based on specific problems you may be having or to mitigate an existing problem. For example, you may have or expect to have one of the following problems:  

- **Device drivers are being selected for the wrong operating system**. In this case, you could organize your device drivers by creating the following folder structure in the Out-of-Box Drivers node in the Deployment Workbench based on operating systems, and then place the device drivers in the corresponding folders:  

  -   Windows 7  

  -   Windows Server 2008 R2  

  -   Windows Server 2012  

  -   Windows 8  

- **Device drivers are being selected for the wrong processor architecture**. In this case, you could organize your device drivers by creating the following folder structure in the Out-of-Box Drivers node in the Deployment Workbench based on processor architecture, and then place the device drivers in the corresponding folders:  

  -   x86  

  -   x64  

- **Device drivers are being selected for the wrong make and model of target computer**. In this case, you could organize your device drivers by creating the following folder structure in the Out-of-Box Drivers node in the Deployment Workbench based on the make and model of the target computer, and then place the device drivers in the corresponding folders:  

  -   make_01\  

       ...\model_01  

       ...\model_02  

       ...\model_03  

  -   make_02\  

       ...\model_aa  

       ...\model_ab  

  -   make_03\  

       ...\model_xx  

       ...\model_xy  

  **Example: Woodgrove Bank Device Driver Folder Structure for LTI**  

  Woodgrove Bank has decided that it wants to maintain precise control over the device drivers deployed to target computers. So, its IP pros create a folder structure in the Out-of-Box Drivers node in the Deployment Workbench that organizes the device drivers by make and model, operating system, and processor architecture:  

  make\model\operating_system\architecture  

  Figure 14 illustrates the folder structure Woodgrove Bank created.  

  ![Dev Toolkit 14](media/DevToolkit14.png "DevToolkit14")  

  **Figure 14. Device driver folder structure created by Woodgrove Bank**  

#####  <a name="CreateSelectionProfilestoSelecttheDeviceDriversforLTIDeployments"></a> Create Selection Profiles to Select the Device Drivers for LTI Deployments  
 Create selection profiles to identify the combination of device drivers that you want to deploy to specific target computers based on the folder structure you created in the Out-of-Box Drivers node in the Deployment Workbench. The LTI deployment process uses selection profiles to determine the device drivers to deploy in the **Inject Drivers** task sequence step type, in CustomSettings.ini, and in the MDT DB.  

 By default, selection profiles deploy the device drivers in the selected folder and subfolders. Create selection profiles based on the level of control you want to have over the device drivers being deployed. If you create selection profiles on folders:  

-   Higher in the folder structure, more device drivers are included, and you have less granular control over the device drivers deployed  

-   Lower in the folder structure, fewer device drivers are included, and you have more granular control over the device drivers deployed  

> [!TIP]
>  Use selection profile names that allow you to easily identify the device drivers included in them, such as Windows 7 32-bit and 64-bit Device Drivers, Windows 8 64-bit Device Drivers, or Fabrikam - Model A532- 32-bit Device Drivers.  

 **Example: Woodgrove Bank Device Driver Selection Profiles for LTI Deployments**  

 Woodgrove Bank has decided that it wants to maintain precise control over the device drivers deployed to target computers. So, its IT pros create a selection profile for each leaf-level folder in following folder structure:  

 make\model\operating_system\architecture  

 Woodgrove Bank named the selection profiles based on the folder structure in the format as follows:  

 make–model-operating_system–architecture  

 The following is an example of the Woodgrove Bank selection profile naming convention for 64-bit device drivers for Windows 8 running on a computer with "Fabrikam" as the make and "FK5323" as the model:  

 "Fabrikam–FK5323–Win8–x64"  

#####  <a name="ConfigureTaskSequencestoDeployDeviceDriversinSelectionProfilesforLTIDeployments"></a> Configure Task Sequences to Deploy Device Drivers in Selection Profiles for LTI Deployments  
 Modify The configuration for your task sequences to reference the selection profiles and deploy the appropriate device drivers to the target computers. Selection profiles are exposed to the LTI deployment process as:  

- Selection profiles that can be configured in the Deployment Workbench, the CustomSettings.ini file, or the MDT DB  

- Device driver groups that can be configured in the CustomSettings.ini file or the MDT DB  

  Selection profiles and device driver groups are additive. The LTI deployment process creates the list of device drivers to deploy based on the union of both selection profiles and device driver groups, which can cause unpredictable results, because the default selection profile and default device driver group include all device drivers. For example, if you specify a selection profile that contains only 64-bit device drivers and leave the default device driver group, the result will include all device drivers.  

  To change this behavior, specify:  

- The**Nothing** device driver group in the CustomSettings.ini file or the MDT DB to allow the selection profile to control the device drivers deployed to the target computer  

- The**Nothing** selection profile in the Inject Driver task sequence step, the CustomSettings.ini file, or the MDT DB to allow the device driver group to control the device drivers deployed to the target computer  

- A specific set of device drivers for the selection profile and the device driver group so that a known set of device drivers is deployed  

  The following are strategies for configuring task sequences to control the deployment of device drivers for LTI deployments:  

- For a single selection profile, modify the **Inject Driver** task sequence step, which is in most of the LTI task sequence templates, to use the selection profile.  

- For a limited number of selection profiles, add an **Inject Driver** task sequence step for each selection profile, and then configure each task sequence step with the corresponding selection profile.  

- Configure a single **Inject Driver** task sequence step in your task sequence, and then override the selection profile specified in the **Inject Driver** task sequence step using the **DriverSelectionProfile** task sequence variable in the CustomSettings.ini file or the MDT DB.  

  > [!NOTE]
  >  The selection profile you specify in the **DriverSelectionProfile** task sequence variable overrides all **Inject Driver** task sequence steps in a task sequence. If you have multiple all **Inject Driver** task sequence steps in your task sequence, they all will be overridden.  

- Configure a single **Inject Driver** task sequence step in the task sequence (which already exists in most of the LTI task sequence templates), but specify additional device drivers to be added using the **DriverGroup** task sequence variable. Because selection profiles and device driver groups are additive, the device drivers specified in the **DriverGroup** task sequence variable are deployed in addition to the device drivers in the selection profile.  

- If you want to use the **DriverGroup** task sequence variable for backward compatibility with previous versions of MDT, configure the **Inject Driver** task sequence step to use the **Nothing** selection profile.  

  > [!NOTE]
  >  You can also use the **DriverPaths** property to specify the UNC path to the folders containing the device drivers to deploy. However, this method is provided for backward compatibility with previous versions of MDT. Instead, use selection profiles or the **DriverGroup** task sequence variable.  

  **Example: Woodgrove Bank Device Driver Task Sequence Configuration for LTI Deployments**  

  Woodgrove Bank has decided that it wants to maintain precise control over the device drivers deployed to target computers. Its IT pros have created a device driver folder structure and selection profile strategy that allows detailed control of device drivers.  

  The IT pros configured their task sequences using the **Inject Driver** task sequence step in their task sequences with the most common configuration in their organization, and then used the **DriverSelectionProfile** task sequence variable in the CustomSettings.ini file and the MDT DB to override the selection profile specified in the **Inject Driver** task sequence step as necessary.  

  The IT pros added the following line in their CustomSettings.ini file for the **DriverSelectionProfile** task sequence variable:  

```  
DriverSelectionProfile =%MAKE%-%MODEL%-Win8-%ARCHITECTURE%  
```  

> [!NOTE]
>  The operating system is a static value for the **DriverSelectionProfile** task sequence variable, because the task sequence will deploy only one operating system.  

####  <a name="ControlDeviceDriverDeploymentsUsingConfigurationManagerforZTI"></a> Control Device Driver Deployments Using Configuration Manager for ZTI  
 ZTI deployments in Configuration Manager use the driver catalog in Configuration Manager as the central repository for device drivers. After you import device drivers into the driver catalog, you can organize them by:  

- **Device driver packages**. Like software packages, device driver packages are distributed to distribution points so that they are accessible to the target computers. You can create multiple device driver packages to group device drivers to be deployed to the target computer, such as the make and model of target computer. You can control the device drivers deployed based on the device driver packages using the **Apply Driver Package** task sequence step.  

- **Device driver categories**. Device driver categories allow you to specify a category for each device driver you import into the driver catalog. Categories allow you to group device drivers based common characteristics, such as all network adapter drivers or by processor architecture. You can control the device drivers deployed to the target computer based on the device driver categories using the **Auto Apply Drivers** task sequence step.  

  Most of the ZTI task sequences created using the MDT task sequence templates include the **Auto Apply Drivers** task sequence step. By default, this step configures the task sequence to deploy all device drivers to the target computer, allowing the target operating system to select the device drivers required.  

  The list that follows provides strategies for configuring task sequences to control the deployment of device drivers for ZTI deployments in Configuration Manager:  

- Create multiple device driver categories that are configured in multiple Auto **Apply Drivers** task sequence steps. Control the deployment of device drivers by performing the following steps:  

  1. Create device driver categories based on the level of granularity you want in controlling the device drivers to be deployed.  

  2. Add multiple **Auto Apply Drivers** task sequence steps based on the number of combination categories you want to deploy.  

  3. Configure the **Auto Apply Drivers** task sequence step to use the proper combination of device driver categories using the **Limit driver matching to only consider drivers in selected categories** list box.  

  4. Configure the task sequence step conditions based on the contents of the device driver package.  

     For example, if the device driver packages are based on the make and model of the target computer, configure the task sequence step to run when the **Make** and **Model** task sequence variables equal the make and model for the device driver package.  

- Create multiple device driver packages that are configured in multiple **Apply Driver Package** task sequence steps. Control the deployment of device drivers by performing the following steps:  

  1. Create device driver packages based on the criteria for limiting the device drivers to be deployed.  

  2. For each device driver package, add an **Apply Driver Package** task sequence step for each category.  

  3. Configure the **Apply Driver Package** task sequence step to use the corresponding device driver package.  

  4. Configure the task sequence step conditions based on the contents of the device driver package.  

     For example, if the device driver packages are based on the make and model of the target computer, configure the task sequence step to run when the Make and **Model** task sequence variables equal the make and model for the device driver package.  

- Configure a single **Auto Apply Drivers** task sequence step in your task sequence, and then override the selection profile specified in the **Auto Apply Drivers** task sequence step using the **OSDAutoApplyDriverCategoryList** task sequence variable in the CustomSettings.ini file or the MDT DB. Control the deployment of device drivers by performing the following steps:  

  1.  Create device driver categories based on the level of granularity you want in controlling the device drivers to be deployed.  

  2.  Add a new or an existing **Auto Apply Drivers** task sequence step in your task sequence.  

  3.  Configure the **Auto Apply Drivers** task sequence step to use any of the device driver categories using the **Limit driver matching to only consider drivers in selected categories** list box.  

      > [!NOTE]
      >  The device driver category you select is not important, as the category will be overridden by the **OSDAutoApplyDriverCategoryList** task sequence variable.  

  4.  Determine GUIDs for each device driver category you created by running the following script, substituting *strSiteCode* with your site code, *strServer* with you Configuration Manager site server, and *strDriverCatName* with the name of a device driver category you created:  

      ```  
      strSiteCode = "NYC"  
      strServer = "CMSERVER"  
      strDriverCatName = "Fabrikam"  
      set objWMIService= GetObject("winmgmts:{impersonationlevel=impersonate}!\\" & strServer & "\root\sms\site_" & strSiteCode)  

      set DriverGUIDS = objWMIService.ExecQuery("select CategoryInstance_UniqueID from CMDB_categoryinstance where LocalizedCategoryInstanceName = '" & strDriverCatName & "'")   
      For each DriverGuid in DriverGuids  
          wscript.echo DriverGuid.CategoryInstance_UniqueID  
      Next  
      ```  

  5.  Modify the CustomSettings.ini file as follows, substituting *SECTION* with the name of a section (such as `[Default]`) and *GUID* with the GUID you retrieved in the previous step:  

      ```  
      [Settings]  
      Properties=OSDAutoAPplyDriverCategoryList  

      [SECTION]  
      OSDAutoApplyDriverCategoryList=DriverCategories:GUID  
      ```  

- When performing deployments using stand-alone media, use an **Apply Driver Package** task sequence step, because the **Auto Apply Drivers** task sequence requires connectivity to a management point, and the stand-alone media will not attempt a connection to a management point.  

####  <a name="ResolveDeviceDriverSigningIssues"></a> Resolve Device Driver Signing Issues  
 Digital signatures tell you whether a device driver is provided by a legitimate publisher. Windows features take advantage of code-signing technologies, and requirements for security in the operating system enforce the use of digital signatures for some kinds of code.  

 In many instances, device drivers from vendors are already signed. However, there may be instances where you modify the files include with the device drivers and need to sign the device drivers again. For example, you might need to modify an INF file for a device driver, and then sign the device driver.  

 Review the following resources to help you resolve device driver signing issues:  

-   [Driver Signing Requirements for Windows](/previous-versions/windows/hardware/design/dn653563(v=vs.85))  

-   [Device Management and Installation Step-by-Step Guide: Signing and Staging Device Drivers in Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2](/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2008-R2-and-2008/dd919230(v=ws.10))  

###  <a name="RunningOrchestratorRunbooks"></a> Running Orchestrator Runbooks  
 System Center 2012 Orchestrator can tie disparate tasks and procedures together by using the Runbook Designer graphical user interface to create reliable, flexible, and efficient end-to-end solutions in the IT environment.  

 You can carry out the following tasks using Orchestrator:  

- Automate processes in your data center, regardless of hardware or platform.  

- Automate your IT operations and standardize best practices to improve operational efficiency.  

- Connect different systems from different vendors without having to know how to use scripting and programming languages.  

  An Orchestrator *runbook* is the sequence of activities that orchestrate actions on computers and networks. You can initiate Orchestrator runbooks in MDT using the **Execute Runbook** task sequence step type.  

> [!NOTE]
>  The **Execute Runbook** task sequence step is not included any MDT task sequence templates. You must add the **Execute Runbook** task sequence step to any task sequences you create.  

##### To configure the Execute Runbook task sequence step type to run Orchestrator runbooks  

1. Edit ***task_sequence_name*** (where *task_sequence_name* is the name of the task sequence to which you want to add the task sequence step) for:  

   -   LTI as described in [Configure the Task Sequence Properties Task Sequence Tab](#ConfiguretheTaskSequencePropertiesTaskSequenceTab)  

   -   ZTI using Configuration Manager as described in [Configuring ZTI Task Sequence Steps in Configuration Manager](#ConfiguringZTITaskSequenceStepsinConfigurationManager)  

2. Add a new task sequence step based on the **Execute Runbook** task sequence type for:  

   1.  LTI on the **Task Sequence** tab (In the task sequence hierarchy, click **Add**, click **General**, and then click **Execute Runbook**.)  

   2.  ZTI in the task sequence hierarchy (Click **Add**, point to **MDT**, and then click **Execute Runbook**.)  

3. On the **Properties** tab, configure the settings listed in Table 171 based on the requirements of your organization, and then click **OK**.

For example, if a runbook has an input parameter named **OSDComputerName**, then the **OSDComputerName** task sequence variable value is passed to the runbook.<br /><br /> This option works only for input parameters that are valid task sequence variable names and do not contain spaces or other special characters. Although spaces and other special characters are supported as Orchestrator parameter names, they are not valid task sequence variable names. If you need to pass values to parameters with spaces or other special characters, use the **Specify explicit runbook parameters** option.<br /><br /> The other option is **Specify explicit runbook parameters**.<br /><br /> The values provided for the runbook input parameters to the Orchestrator web service are formatted as XML. Passing values that contain data that is or resembles XML-formatted data may cause errors.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

This is the name of the input runbook parameter.<br /><br /> If you change the parameters for an existing Orchestrator runbook, you need to browse (reselect) for the runbook again, because MDT only retrieves the parameter list when initially adding the Orchestrator runbook.<br /><br /> -                                  **Value**. This can be a constant or a variable, such as a task sequence variable or an environment variable. For example, you can specify a value of **%OSDComputerName%**, which will pass the value of the **OSDComputerName** task sequence variable to the runbook input parameter.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

The amount of time between polls starts at 1 second, then increases to 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, and 64 seconds between each poll. Once the amount of time reaches 64 seconds, the task sequence step continues to poll every 64 seconds.<br /><br /> -                                  **Cleared**, then the task sequence step will not wait for the runbook to finish before proceeding to the next task sequence step.<br /><br /> This check box must be selected if the runbook returns output parameters.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

   If the Orchestrator runbook returns parameters, the values of the return parameters are set to corresponding task sequence variable names. If an Orchestrator runbook return parameter name contains spaces, the **ZTIExecuteRunbook.wsf** script will strip the spaces from the parameter name when creating the corresponding task sequence variable name.  

> [!NOTE]
>  If a runbook return parameter name contains other special characters, the return parameter may be ignored or generate errors.  

 For example, if a runbook return parameter has a name of **OSD Computer Name**, then the corresponding task sequence variable name **OSDComputerName** and the value in the return parameter will be saved in the **OSDComputerName** task sequence variable.  

> [!NOTE]
>  The **Wait for the runbook to finish before continuing** check box must be selected if the runbook returns output parameters.  

###  <a name="RunningWindowsPowerShellScriptsDuringDeployment"></a> Running Windows PowerShell Scripts During Deployment  
 MDT supports running Windows PowerShell scripts as a part of the deployment process. You can develop Windows PowerShell scripts to help automate the deployment process and then run those scripts within an MDT task sequence.  

 Run the Windows PowerShell scripts using a task sequence step created using the **Run PowerShell Script** task sequence step type. You can add a task sequence step based on the **Run PowerShell Script** task sequence step type for task sequences in LTI, ZTI, or UDI.  

> [!NOTE]
>  For Configuration Manager task sequences, run the **Use Toolkit Package** task sequence step prior to running the **Run PowerShell Script** task sequence step.  

##### To run a Windows PowerShell script in a task sequence  

1.  Create the Windows PowerShell script.  

     For more information about creating Windows PowerShell scripts for use in MDT task sequences, see [Create Windows PowerShell Scripts for Use in MDT](#CreateWindowsPowerShellScriptsforUseinMDT).  

2.  Place the Windows PowerShell script in the Scripts subfolder in the:  

    -   Deployment share for LTI  

    -   MDT files package for ZTI and UDI  

3.  Add a new task sequence step to your task sequence based on the **Run PowerShell Script** task sequence step type.  

4.  In the newly create task sequence step, in the **PowerShell script** text box, ***script_name*** (where *script_name* is the fully qualified path to the Windows PowerShell script).  

     If you specify:  

    -   Just the script name, then the assumption is that the script exists in the Scripts subfolder  

    -   A fully qualified path and script name, then ensure that the task sequence has access to the folder in which the script is stored (For example, if the script is stored on a network shared folder, ensure that there is an existing connection to that server prior to running the script.)  

###  <a name="ApplyingGroupPolicyObjectPacks"></a> Applying Group Policy Object Packs  
 Deploying operating systems and applications so that they are compliant with security and regulatory standards is an essential part of any deployment effort. MDT allows you to apply security and compliance configuration templates to the operating system and applications after they are deployed using Group Policy object (GPO) packs.  

 GPO packs are created by exporting a GPO backup in the Microsoft Security Compliance Manager. These GPO packs are applied by the **Apply Local GPO Package** task sequence step for task sequences created using the MDT task sequence templates. The **Apply Local GPO Package** task sequence step runs the ZTIApplyGPOPack.wsf script, which is responsible for applying the GPO packs to the target computer.  

> [!NOTE]
>  GPO packs are only used to configure security and compliance configuration settings for Windows operating systems, not the applications running on the operating system. For example, the Internet Explorer or Microsoft Office security and compliance configuration settings in Security Compliance Manager cannot be used as GPO packs.  

 The following MDT task sequence templates include the**Apply Local GPO Package** task sequence step:  

-   **Standard Client Task Sequence** in LTI in ZTI  

-   **Standard Server Task Sequence** in LTI and ZTI  

-   **Deploy to VHD Client Task Sequence** in LTI  

-   **Deploy to VHD Server Task Sequence** in LTI  

> [!NOTE]
>  Applying GPO packs affects system behavior and features because of the increased security requirements that GPO packs could configure. The result is that you may lose certain functionality after a GPO pack is applied.  

 If the security configuration settings that the Security Compliance Manager GPO packs provide are too stringent, perform one of the following tasks:  

- Modify the existing GPO templates to be less restrictive.  

- Provide a custom GPO template that you have created that is less restrictive.  

- Disable the **Apply Local GPO Package** task sequence step in your task sequence.  

  For example, the GPO pack for Windows 7 can enforce Server Message Block (SMB) configuration settings that could prevent Windows 7 from communicating with other devices running Common Internet File System (CIFS) or SAMBA.  

  Apply GPO packs templates by performing the following steps:  

1.  Identify or create the GPO packs required by your organization as described in [Identify or Create the GPO Packs.](#IdentifyorCreatetheGPOPacks)  

2.  Place the GPO packs in the appropriate MDT folders as described in [Place the GPO Packs in the Appropriate MDT Folders](#PlacetheGPOPacksintheAppropriateMDTFolders).  

3.  Configure MDT to deploy the GPO packs as described in [Configure MDT to Deploy the GPO Packs](#ConfigureMDTtoDeploytheGPOPacks).  

####  <a name="IdentifyorCreatetheGPOPacks"></a> Identify or Create the GPO Packs  
 You can use GPO packs that are:  

-   **Generated from the Security Compliance Manager**. The Security Compliance Manager can export a GPO backup that you can use as a GPO pack. You can copy these GPO packs to the MDT files folder and apply them during the deployment process.  

-   **Customized by you**. You can create your own customized GPO packs based on your organization's requirements. You can use the security and compliance configuration settings in Security Compliance Manager as a beginning, and then customize those settings for your organization. Then, you can export the security and compliance configurations settings as a GPO backup and subsequently a GPO pack.  

####  <a name="PlacetheGPOPacksintheAppropriateMDTFolders"></a> Place the GPO Packs in the Appropriate MDT Folders  
 After you have identified or created the GPO packs that your organization requires, place the GPO packs in subfolder in the Templates\GPOPacksfolder in the:  

-   Deployment share for LTI  

-   MDT files package for ZTI and UDI  

####  <a name="ConfigureMDTtoDeploytheGPOPacks"></a> Configure MDT to Deploy the GPO Packs  
 The **Apply Local GPO Package** task sequence step can be configured using the properties listed in Table 172. These properties can be configured using the CustomSettings.ini file or the MDT DB.  

### Table 172. Properties Used to Configure the Apply Local GPO Package Task Sequence Step  

|Property|Description|  
|--------------|-----------------|  
|ApplyGPOPack|This property is used to determine whether the **Apply Local GPO Package** task sequence step is performed. If the value is set to:<br /><br /> -                              **YES**, then the task sequence step is performed<br /><br /> -                              **NO**, then the task sequence step is not performed<br /><br /> The default value is **YES**.<br /><br /> The **ApplyGPOPack** property can be set in the CustomSettings.ini file or in the MDT DB. For more information on configuring the **ApplyGPOPack** property, see the **ApplyGPOPack** property in the MDT document *Toolkit Reference*.|  
|GPOPackPath|This property is used to override the default path to the root folder for all the GPO packs. The path specified in this property is relative to the Templates\GPOPacks folder.The default path to the root folder for all the GPO packs is the Templates\GPOPacks folder.<br /><br /> For more information on configuring the **GPOPackPath** property, see the **GPOPackPath** property in the MDT document *Toolkit Reference*.|  

> [!NOTE]
>  The appropriate GPO pack is selected based on the operating system being deployed. If no matching GPO pack can be found, then no GPO pack will be applied.  

###  <a name="EnablingParticipationinCEIPandWER"></a> Enabling Participation in CEIP and WER  
 MDT includes a new task sequence step that automates the configuration of participation in [Windows Customer Experience Improvement Program](https://privacy.microsoft.com/privacystatement) (CEIP) and [Windows Error Reporting](/windows/win32/wer/windows-error-reporting) (WER). The **Opt In to CEIP and WER** task sequence step is used to automate this participation.  

> [!NOTE]
>  Although you can use MDT task sequences to enable CEIP and WER for Windows operating systems (only when the corresponding task sequence step is enabled), this is separate from the CEIP information gathered when you opt in to the MDT CEIP program. For more information, see the [Microsoft Privacy Statement](https://privacy.microsoft.com/privacystatement).  

 The **Opt In to CEIP and WER** task sequence step is included in the following MDT task sequence templates but is disabled by default:  

- **Standard Client Task Sequence** in LTI and ZTI  

- **Standard Server Task Sequence** in LTI and ZTI  

- **Deploy to VHD Client Task Sequence** in LTI  

- **Deploy to VHD Server Task Sequence** in LTI  

- **User Driven Installation Task Sequence** in UDI  

  The **Opt In to CEIP and WER** task sequence step runs the ZTIOptIn.wsf script as shown in the following example:  

```  
cscript.exe %SCRIPTROOT%\ZTIOptIn.wsf /CEIP:YES /WER:YES  
```  

 The ZTIOptIn.wsf script has the following named parameters:  

-   **CEIP**. This parameter determines the participation in CEIP and can be one of the following:  

    -   **YES**. This value specifies to enable participation.  

    -   **NO**. This value specifies to not enable participation.  

    > [!NOTE]
    >  Any value other than **YES** is treated as **NO**, including not providing the parameter.  

-   **WER**. This parameter determines the participation in WER and can be one of the following:  

    -   **YES**. This value specifies to enable participation.  

    -   **NO**. This value specifies to not enable participation.  

> [!NOTE]
>  Any value other than **YES** is treated as **NO**, including not providing the parameter.

   > [!NOTE]
   >  If you configure values in the CustomSettings.ini or the MDT DB, use the %DESTINATIONLOGICALDRIVE% task sequence variable instead of the %SYSTEMROOT% variable. For LTI deployments, the variables are evaluated while running Windows PE, so the %SYSTEMROOT% variable will return the SystemRoot folder for Windows PE, not the target operating system. The %SYSTEMROOT% variable for Windows PE typically is set to X:\WINDOWS.  

5. In the **Site name** box, type the name of the site in which to install the domain controller.  

    The default name for a new forest or site is *default_first_site*; however, this value does not appear in the **Site name** box by default—you must type it.

####  <a name="ConfigureAuthorizeDHCPTaskSequenceStepSettings"></a> Configure Authorize DHCP Task Sequence Step Settings  
 Authorizing the DHCP service within AD DS is imperative to successfully deploying and using DHCP services within a Windows-based network.  

> [!NOTE]
>  The ZTI task sequence templates that are provided with MDT do not include an **Authorize DHCP** task sequence step type. You must manually add this step type if you want to automatically authorize the DHCP server as a part of the ZTI deployment.  

###### To authorize the DHCP server role in AD DS  

1.  Edit ***task_sequence_name*** (where *task_sequence_name* is the name of the task sequence to which you want to add the task sequence step) for:  

    -   LTI as described in [Configure the Task Sequence Properties Task Sequence Tab](#ConfiguretheTaskSequencePropertiesTaskSequenceTab)  

    -   ZTI using Configuration Manager as described in [Configuring ZTI Task Sequence Steps in Configuration Manager](#ConfiguringZTITaskSequenceStepsinConfigurationManager)  

2.  Add a new task sequence step based on the **Authorize DHCP** task sequence type for:  

    -   LTI on the **Task Sequence** tab (In the task sequence hierarchy, click **Add**, click **Roles**, and then click **Authorize DHCP**.)  

    -   ZTI in the task sequence hierarchy (Click **Add**, click **MDT**, and then click **Authorize DHCP**.)  

3.  On the **Properties** tab, type the relevant information in the following boxes:  

    -   **Name**. The name by which the task appears in the task sequence list.  

    -   **Description**. A description of the task.  

4.  In the **Account** box, type the name of an account with permissions to authorize the DHCP service in AD DS. Click **Set**, and then type the following information in the relevant boxes:  

    -   **Username**. The account that can authorize DHCP, in the format domain\user  

    -   **Password**. The password for the account  

    -   **Confirm Password**. Retype the password  

5.  Click **OK**, then click **OK** again.  

###  <a name="CopyingContenttotheTargetComputer"></a> Copying Content to the Target Computer  
 To copy content to target computers, perform any combination of the following steps:  

-   Copy content to the target computer using a task sequence step as described in [Copy Content to Target Computers Using Task Sequence Steps](#CopyContenttoTargetComputersUsingTaskSequenceSteps).  

-   Copy content to the target computer using $OEM$ folders as described [Copy Content to Target Computers Using $OEM$ Folders](#CopyContenttoTargetComputersUsingOEMFolders).  

####  <a name="CopyContenttoTargetComputersUsingTaskSequenceSteps"></a> Copy Content to Target Computers Using Task Sequence Steps  
 Create a task sequence based on the **Run Command Line** task sequence step type that runs the **xcopy.exe** command or a similar command to copy the content to the target computer. Ensure that the **Run Command Line** task sequence step type occurs prior to any task sequence steps or scripts that depend on the files being copied to the target computers. For more information about modifying task sequence steps, see [Configure the Task Sequence Steps and Step Sequence](#ConfiguretheTaskSequenceStepsandStepSequence).  

####  <a name="CopyContenttoTargetComputersUsingOEMFolders"></a> Copy Content to Target Computers Using $OEM$ Folders  
 MDT supports using legacy $OEM$ folders to organize and copy supplemental files to the target computers. Data WIM files are preferred over $OEM$ folders.  

> [!NOTE]
>  In an instance where multiple $OEM$ folders have been defined, the first driver that LTIApply.wsf finds is deployed to the target computer.  

 For more information about using data WIM files or $OEM$ folders see the *Windows Assessment and Deployment Kit User's Guide* in the Windows ADK.  

 MDT looks in the following locations within the deployment share, in the order specified, to find an $OEM$ folder:  

- **Control\\*task_sequence*** (where *task_sequence* is the name or ID of the task sequence that MDT is installing). Create $OEM$ folders in this location to create a custom folder for each build.  

- **Operating Systems\\*Name*** (where Name is the name of the operating system MDT is installing). Create $OEM$ folders in this location to create a custom folder for each operating system.  

- ***Platform***  (where *Platform* is either x86 or x64). Create $OEM$ folders in this location to create a custom folder for each platform.  

- **$OEM$**, which is at the root of the deployment share and is the default $OEM$ folder if a folder is not found in the previous locations.  

  An $OEM$ folder contains supplemental files. The following list describes each folder that you can create within an $OEM$ folder to organize these files:  

- **$$**. Windows Setup copies the contents of this folder to %SystemRoot% on each destination computer. It replicates all the folders, subfolders, and files that this folder contains in the %SystemRoot% folder of each destination computer. For Windows Setup to copy a file to %SystemRoot%\System32 on each destination computer, for example, put the file in $OEM$\\$$\System32.  

- **$1**. Windows Setup copies the contents of this folder to %SystemDrive% on each destination computer. It replicates all the folders, subfolders, and files that this folder contains in the %SystemDrive% folder on each destination computer. This is typically drive C on most computers.  

- **Drive**. Drive is a drive letter (C, D, E, and so on). Windows Setup copies the contents of this folder to the root of the corresponding drive on each destination computer. It replicates all the folders, subfolders, and files that this folder contains in the corresponding drive during the setup process. For example, Windows Setup copies any files put in $OEM$\D to the root of drive D on each destination computer.  

   Microsoft recommends that these folders not be used. The folders rely on a very specific disk configuration on the destination computer. Use $1 to represent %SystemDrive%, instead. In most installations, $OEM$\\$1 and $OEM$\C write to the same location: the root of drive C.  

###  <a name="CreatingCustomScriptsforMDT"></a> Creating Custom Scripts for MDT  
 Scripts provide automation of the image-build and overall deployment process. They scan the configuration files, query the configuration database, evaluate environment variables to determine the rules to be used when deploying the images to the target computers, and perform many other intricate deployment tasks. MDT uses both Microsoft Visual Basic® Scripting Edition (VBScript [.vbs]) and Windows Script file (.wsf) scripts. Typically, there is no need to modify one of the delivered scripts. If a modification is necessary, instead of modifying one of the delivered scripts, copy the script to a new file, update it, and thoroughly test the effect of any change.  

 The scripts create log files as the scripts automate the deployment process. The log files record the status of the deployment process and can be used to assist in troubleshooting this process:  

-   Develop new scripts for use in MDT deployments as described in [Develop Custom Scripts](#DevelopCustomScripts).  

-   Create new scripts for use in MDT deployments from a template as described in [Create New Scripts from a Template](#CreateNewScriptsfromaTemplate).  

-   Create Windows PowerShell scripts for use in MDT deployments as described in [Create Windows PowerShell Scripts for Use in MDT](#CreateWindowsPowerShellScriptsforUseinMDT).  

####  <a name="DevelopCustomScripts"></a> Develop Custom Scripts  
 You can develop new scripts for use in MDT deployments. These scripts should be in the form of .vbs or .wsf files. For examples of scripts that the Deployment Workbench uses, open the installation path of the deployment share, and then open the Scripts folder.  

> [!NOTE]
>  Microsoft does not support customized and custom scripts.  

 Before describing how to create a script, it is best to review how the scripts included with MDT are constructed. The standard MDT script is a .wsf file, which allows references to be made to functions that are contained in other scripts. MDT scripts leverage this functionality by referencing the ZTIUtility.vbs script and the ZTIDataAccess.vbs script. The ZTIUtility.vbs script is used to initialize the MDT environment and setup classes. The ZTIDataAccess.vbs script includes the common routines for database access, including connecting to and querying databases, and provides a web service interface.  

 The scripts define several standard objects that need not be declared in the script:  

- **oFSO**. File System Object  

- **oShell**. WScript Shell object  

- **oEnv**. Process Environment object  

- **oNetwork**. WScript Network object  

  The following classes are defined that perform several standard tasks:  

- **Environment**. Configures environment variables gathered through WMI and MDT rule processing, allowing for direct reference from the script, and is defined in ZTIUtility.vbs as described in [Environment Class](#EnvironmentClass).  

- **Logging**. Provides the logging functionality that all MDT scripts use, creating a single log file for each script and a consolidated log file of all scripts and is defined in ZTIUtility.vbs as described in [Logging Class](#LoggingClass).  

- **Utility**. Provides general utility functionality and is defined in ZTIUtility.vbs as described in [Utility Class](#UtilityClass).  

- **Database**. Provide access to databases and is defined in ZTIDataAccess.vbs as described in [Database Class](#DatabaseClass). The **Database** class:  

  -   Is used by ZTIGather.wsf when processing database rules from the CustomSettings.ini or BootStrap.ini files  

  -   Can be used to access databases in scripts instead of configuring the CustomSettings.ini or BootStrap.ini files; you can specify the parameters for accessing the database in the scripts  

- **WebService**. Provides access to web services and is defined in ZTIDataAccess.vbs as described in [WebService Class](#WebServiceClass). The **WebService** class:  

  -   Is used by ZTIGather.wsf when processing web service rules from the CustomSettings.ini or BootStrap.ini files  

  -   Can be used to access web services in scripts instead of configuring the CustomSettings.ini or BootStrap.ini files; you can specify the parameters for accessing the web services in the scripts  

#####  <a name="EnvironmentClass"></a> Environment Class  
 Reference this class in scripts through the **oEnvironment** object. For example, change the computer name to **Example** using the command:  

```  
oEnvironment.Item("ComputerName") = "Example"  
```  

 Or, to determine whether this is a 32-bit or 64-bit architecture, query the architecture using the command:  

```  
oEnvironment.Item("Architecture")  
```  

#####  <a name="LoggingClass"></a> Logging Class  
 Reference this class in scripts through the **oLogging** object. When creating an informational log entry, use the command:  

```  
oLogging.CreateEntry "Informational message", LogTypeInfo  
```  

 When creating an error log entry, use the command:  

```  
oLogging.CreateEntry "An error occurred",LogTypeError  
```  

#####  <a name="UtilityClass"></a> Utility Class  
 Reference this class in scripts through the **oUtility** object. To determine the name of the current script, use the command:  

```  
oUtility.ScriptName  
```  

 To find the location of a file, use the command:  

```  
iRetVal = oUtility.FindFile("CustomSettings.ini", sIniFile)  
```  

#####  <a name="DatabaseClass"></a> Database Class  
 Reference this class in scripts through the **Database** class. You can create an instance of the object class and connect to a database using following script excerpt:  

```  
<script language="VBScript" src="ZTIUtility.vbs"/>   <script language="VBScript" src="ZTIDataAccess.vbs"/>  
<script language="VBScript">  

   Dim oDatabase  
   Dim oRecordset  

   Set oDatabase = new Database  
   oDatabase.SQLServer = "NYC-MDT-01"  
   oDatabase.Instance = "SQLExpress"  
   oDatabase.Database = "MDTDB"  
   oDatabase.Port = ""  
   oDatabase.Netlib = "DBNMPNTW"  
   oDatabase.Table = "ComputerSettings"  
   oDatabase.Parameters = "UUID, AssetTag, SerialNumber, MacAddress"  
   oDatabase.ParameterCondition = "OR"  
   oDatabase.SQLShare = "DeploymentShare$"  

   oDatabase.Connect  

   Set oRecordset = oDatabase.Query  
   WScript.Echo "Records retrieved: " & oRecordset.RecordCount  
```  

#####  <a name="WebServiceClass"></a> WebService Class  
 Reference this class in scripts through the **WebService** class. You can create an instance of the object class and connect to a database using following script excerpt:  

```  
<script language="VBScript" src="ZTIUtility.vbs"/>   <script language="VBScript" src="ZTIDataAccess.vbs"/>  
<script language="VBScript">  

   Dim oWebService  
   Dim oXML  

   oEnvironment.Item("USZip") = "98029"  
   oEnvironment.Item("USZip") = "98029"  
   Set oWebService = new WebService  
   oWebService.WebService = "https://www.webservicex.net/uszip.asmx/GetInfoByZIP"  
   oWebService.Parameters = "USZip"  

   Set oXML = oWebService.Query  
   WScript.Echo "Web service response:"  
   WScript.Echo oXML.XML  
```  

####  <a name="CreateNewScriptsfromaTemplate"></a> Create New Scripts from a Template  
 You can also create scripts for use in the imaging process. You call these scripts by adding them to the Task Sequence Editor and ultimately by adding them to the TS.xml file. Listing 13 shows a template for creating custom scripts.  

 **Listing 13. Custom Script Template**

End Function  

</script>  
</job>  
```  

 At a high level, complete the following steps to add a custom script:  

1. Create the script based on the template.  

2. Place the script in the Scripts folder of the:  

   -   Deployment share for LTI deployments  

   -   Package source for the Microsoft Deployment Toolkit Files package  

3. Create a task sequence step based on the **Run Command Line** task sequence step type in your task sequence.  

4. Configure the task sequence step created in the previous step to run your script.  

   Follow these guidelines when creating a script:  

-   Always declare variables.  

-   Only create objects where required, because MDT includes most objects that are needed.  

-   Verify that ZTIUtility.vbs and ZTIDataAccess.vbs do not already provide the functionality required before writing a function.  

####  <a name="CreateWindowsPowerShellScriptsforUseinMDT"></a> Create Windows PowerShell Scripts for Use in MDT  
 MDT allows you to create Windows PowerShell scripts, and then run those scripts as a part of a MDT task sequence using the **Run PowerShell Script** task sequence step type. The Windows PowerShell scripts that you create can perform any typical automation supported by the target operating system.  

 Create Windows PowerShell scripts for use in MDT by:  

1.  Including the prerequisites in your Windows PowerShell script for running in MDT as described in [Include Prerequisites for Running Windows PowerShell Scripts in MDT](#IncludePrerequisitesforRunningWindowsPowerShellScriptsinMDT)  

2.  Using task sequence variables within your Windows PowerShell script as described in [Use Task Sequence Variables Within Windows PowerShell Scripts](#UseTaskSequenceVariablesWithinWindowsPowerShellScripts)  

3.  Updating the MDT logs with output from your Windows PowerShell scripts as described in [Update MDT Logs Using Windows PowerShell Scripts](#UpdateMDTLogsUsingWindowsPowerShellScripts)  

4.  Interpreting Windows PowerShell return codes generated by your script as described in [Interpret Windows PowerShell Script Return Codes](#InterpretWindowsPowerShellScriptReturnCodes)  

#####  <a name="IncludePrerequisitesforRunningWindowsPowerShellScriptsinMDT"></a> Include Prerequisites for Running Windows PowerShell Scripts in MDT  
 When a **Run PowerShell Script** task sequence step runs a Windows PowerShell script, the step automatically loads the **Microsoft.BDD.TaskSequenceModule** module prior to running the script. The **Microsoft.BDD.TaskSequenceModule** module is responsible for creating the **TSENV**: and **TSENVLIST**: Windows PowerShell drives.  

 In addition, it is recommended that your script load the **ZTIUtility.psm1** module at the beginning of your script by adding the following line to the beginning of your script:  

 Import-Module `.\ZTIUtility.psm1`  

 Including the **ZTIUtility.psm1** module at the beginning of your script provides the following features:  

1. Creates the **TSENV**: and **TSENVLIST**: Windows PowerShell drives so that you can test your script outside a task sequence  

2. Provides support for Windows PowerShell task sequence module features that may be provided in future releases  

   For more information on the **TSENV**: and **TSENVLIST**: Windows PowerShell drives, see [Use Task Sequence Variables Within Windows PowerShell Scripts](#UseTaskSequenceVariablesWithinWindowsPowerShellScripts).  

> [!NOTE]
>  For Configuration Manager task sequences, run the **Use Toolkit Package** task sequence step prior to running the **Run PowerShell Script** task sequence step.  

 If your script needs to load other custom modules, places those modules in a subfolder beneath the Tools\Modules folder. By default, the module path is modified to include the Tools\Modules folder and all subfolders. For example, if you have a module in the MyCustomModule.psm1 file, create the Tools\Modules\MyCustomModule folder and the place MyCustomModule.psm1 file in that folder. To load your custom module in your script, include the following line in your script:  

```  
Import-Module MyCustomModule  
```  

#####  <a name="UseTaskSequenceVariablesWithinWindowsPowerShellScripts"></a> Use Task Sequence Variables Within Windows PowerShell Scripts  
 Your Windows PowerShell script can get or set task sequence variables that can be consumed by MDT. You get or set task sequence variables using the following Windows PowerShell drives:  

- **TSENV**:. This drive is a list of all the task sequence variables and their current values. You can access this drive as you would any other Windows drive. For example, you could type the following command within Windows PowerShell to list all the task sequence variables and their current values:dir tsenv:  

- **TSENVLIST**:. This drive lists all the task sequence variables and their current values as an array.  

  > [!NOTE]
  >  Any values in the TSENV: and TSENVLIST: drives are lost after the task sequence completes as any values are stored in memory and are not persisted after the task sequence finishes.  

  The following are examples that illustrate how to access task sequence variables using these drives:  

- `$tsenv:GPOPackPath = "\\WDG-MDT-01\Packages$\GPOPacks"`  

   This command updates the **ApplyGPOPack** task sequence variable to "\\\WDG-MDT-01\Packages$\GPOPacks"  

- `Write-Host $tsenv:ScriptRoot`  

   This command displays the contents of the **ScriptRoot** task sequence variable to the Windows PowerShell console.  

- `$packages = $tsenvlist:PACKAGES`  

   This command sets the **$packages** Windows PowerShell variable to the current value of the **PACKAGES** task sequence variable.  

- `$tsenvlist:PACKAGES = @("XXX00001:Program","XXX00002:Program")`  

   This command sets the value of the **PACKAGES** task sequence variable to `"XXX00001:Program","XXX00002:Program"`.  

####  <a name="UpdateMDTLogsUsingWindowsPowerShellScripts"></a> Update MDT Logs Using Windows PowerShell Scripts  
 By default, the output from your Windows PowerShell scripts is written to BDD.LOG. Table 175 lists the message types that appear in the BDD.LOG file and how those types of messages are generated by your script.  

### Table 175. BDD.LOG Message Types and Script Output That Generates Them  

|Message type| Generated by the following cmdlets|  
|------------------|----------------------------------------|  
|Informational|Any cmdlets that write to the Windows PowerShell console, such as Write-Host or Out-Host|  
|Warning|Write-Warning cmdlet|  
|Error|Write-Error cmdlet|  

 The progress for your Windows PowerShell script is shown in the task sequence progress UI and is displayed as follows:  

-   Progress is shown as a percentage of total completion for the current script and any messages that are being displayed.  

-   Progress is updated using the standard [Write-Progress](/previous-versions//dd347663(v=technet.10)) cmdlet.  

> [!NOTE]
>  Unlike some of the other scripts in MDT, a separate log file is not generated for the task sequence step running the Windows PowerShell script. Logging is only performed in the BDD.LOG file.  

####  <a name="InterpretWindowsPowerShellScriptReturnCodes"></a> Interpret Windows PowerShell Script Return Codes  
 By default, if your Windows PowerShell script reports a terminating error or non-zero return code, the task sequence step will fail and stop running (unless you have configured the step to ignore the generated return code).  

  Table 176 lists the predefined return codes that MDT returns and provides a brief description of each. Any other return codes not listed in Table 176 were returned by the Windows PowerShell script.  

### Table 176. Predefined Windows PowerShell Script Return Codes  

|Return code|Description|  
|-----------------|-----------------|  
|10901|Unable to find the Windows PowerShell script in the location specified.|  
|10902|No Windows PowerShell script was specified in the task sequence step.|  
|10903|A terminating error was reported by the Windows PowerShell script.|  

##  <a name="PerformingDeploymentsUsingtheMDTDB"></a> Performing Deployments Using the MDT DB  
 MDT includes a database—the MDT DB—that you can use to provide configuration settings for LTI or ZTI deployments using Configuration Manager. Configure the MDT DB through the Deployment Workbench in MDT or any other data-management tool that you can use to modify information stored in SQL Server databases.  

 Conceptually, the MDT DB is a centralized version of the CustomSettings.ini file. The advantage to using the MDT DB is that for larger deployments, you have a centralized repository for managing deployment configuration settings.  

 You can store the MDT DB on the same SQL Server computer that is used for Configuration Manager, on a SQL Server computer on which MDT is installed, or on any other SQL Server computer in your organization.  

 Perform deployments using the MDT DB by:  

-   Prepare the MDT DB to provide configuration settings for MDT deployments as described in [Preparing the MDT DB](#PreparingtheMDTDB).  

-   Select the methods for applying configuration settings to targeted computers using the MDT DB as described in [Selecting the Methods for Applying Configuration Settings](#SelectingtheMethodsforApplyingConfigurationSettings).  

-   Manage the configuration settings stored in the MDT DB as described in [Managing Configuration Settings Stored in the MDT DB](#ManagingConfigurationSettingsStoredintheMDTDB)  

-   Configuring MDT deployment process to retrieve configuration settings from the MDT DB by changing CustomSettings.ini as described in [Configuring the MDT Deployment Process to Retreive Configuration Settings from the MDT DB](#ConfiguringtheMDTDeploymentProcesstoRetreiveConfigurationSettingsfromtheMDTDB)  

-   Extending the schema of the MDT DB as described in [Extending the MDT DB Schema](#ExtendingtheMDTDBSchema)  

###  <a name="PreparingtheMDTDB"></a> Preparing the MDT DB  
 Before you can use the MDT DB to provide configuration settings to MDT deployments, you must prepare the MDT DB for use by MDT. Prepare the MDT DB for storing Configuration settings by:  

-   Creating a new MDT DB or connecting to an existing MDT DB as described in [Creating a New MDT DB or Connecting to an Existing MDT DB](#CreatingaNewMDTDBorConnectingtoanExistingMDTDB)  

-   Upgrading the MDT DB from a previous version of MDT as described in [Upgrading an Existing MDT DB](#UpgradinganExistingMDTDB)  

-   Assigning appropriate permissions to the MDT DB as described in [Assigning the Appropriate Permissions to the MDT DB](#AssigningtheAppropriatePermissionstotheMDTDB)  

####  <a name="CreatingaNewMDTDBorConnectingtoanExistingMDTDB"></a> Creating a New MDT DB or Connecting to an Existing MDT DB  
 Before you can manage configuration settings in the MDT DB, create a new MDT DB or connect to an existing MDT DB in the Deployment Workbench. The MDT DB contains the database objects that the MDT deployment process uses, such as views, tables, and stored procedures. You create a new MDT DB or connect to an existing the MDT DB database objects using the Advanced Configuration/Database node in the Deployment Workbench.  

> [!NOTE]
>  To create and manage the MDT DB for LTI or ZTI deployments using Configuration Manager, create a deployment share in the Deployment Workbench. However, for ZTI deployments, you do not need to add any content to the deployment share, as ZTI deployments do not require it.  

 Create a new MDT DB or connect to an existing MDT DB by performing one of the following tasks:  

-   Create a new MDT DB as described in [Create a New MDT DB](#CreateaNewMDTDB).  

-   Connect to an existing MDT DB as described in [Connect to an Existing MDT DB](#ConnecttoanExistingMDTDB).  

#####  <a name="CreateaNewMDTDB"></a> Create a New MDT DB  
 Create a new MDT DB, and then create the MDT DB database objects in the database. You can create the MDT DB in:  

-   An existing database as described in [Create the MDT DB in an Existing Database](#CreatetheMDTDBinanExistingDatabase)  

-   A new database as described in [Create the MDT DB in a New Database](#CreatetheMDTDBinaNewDatabase)  

######  <a name="CreatetheMDTDBinanExistingDatabase"></a> Create the MDT DB in an Existing Database  
 If you want to store the MDT DB in a SQL Server database that database administrator (DBA) manages, the DBA must create the MDT DB, and then grant you the appropriate permissions to create the MDT DB objects in the new database. When the database has been created, create the MDT DB in the new database using the Deployment Workbench.  

> [!NOTE]
>  To create the MDT DB, the db_owner database role must exist in the database that the DBA created.  

###### To create the MDT DB in an existing database  

1. The DBA creates the database and grants you DBA permission on the database.  

2. Click **Start**, and then point to **All Programs**. Point to **Microsoft Deployment Toolkit**, and then click **Deployment Workbench**.  

3. In the Deployment Workbench console tree, go to Deployment Workbench/Deployment Shares/*deployment_share*/Advanced Configuration/Database (where *deployment_share* is the name of the deployment share in which you will add the application).

###  <a name="SelectingtheMethodsforApplyingConfigurationSettings"></a> Selecting the Methods for Applying Configuration Settings  
 After preparing the MDT DB, select the method for applying MDT configuration settings using the MDT DB. You can manage the configuration settings stored in the MDT DB using the nodes beneath the Database node in a Deployment Workbench deployment share.  

> [!NOTE]
>  Managing configuration settings stored in the MDT DB using the Deployment Workbench is good when adding a limited number of entries or managing individual entries. If you want to make bulk additions or updates to the MDT DB, use standard SQL Server database tools as described in [Manage Configuration Settings Stored in the MDT DB Using SQL Server Management Tools](#ManageConfigurationSettingsStoredintheMDTDBUsingSQLServerManagementTools).  

 Each node beneath the Database node corresponds to a method for applying configuration settings. Table 181 lists the nodes beneath the Database node and describes when to make configuration settings in each node.  

### Table 181. Nodes Beneath the Database Node in a Deployment Share  

|Node|Use this node to define|  
|----------|-----------------------------|  
|Computers|Specific target computers based on one of these properties: **AssetTag**, **UUID**, **SerialNumber**, or **MACAddress** properties. Associate property settings, applications, packages, roles, and Administrator-level accounts with a computer.<br /><br /> Select this method when you want to provide configuration settings to a specific target computer. For example, you could use the MAC address of the primary network adapter of each computer to uniquely identify each computer.|  
|Roles|A group of computers based on the tasks performed by the users of the target computers (using the **Role** property). Associate property settings, applications, packages, and Administrator-level accounts with a role.<br /><br /> Select this method when you want to provide configuration settings to a group of computers that perform a specific job function. The roles can be based on users or actual target computers. For example, you could provide configuration settings for highly secured computers used to process confidential data.|  
|Locations|A group of computers using the **DefaultGateway** property of the target computers to identify a geographic location. Associate property settings, applications, packages, roles, and Administrator-level accounts with a location.<br /><br /> Select this method when you want to provide configuration settings to a group of computers that reside with in a specific geographic site. For example, you could provide configuration settings for services that are provided within the local site.|  
|Make and Model|A group of computers using the **Make** and **Model** properties of the target computers. Associate property settings, applications, packages, roles, and Administrator-level accounts with target computers that are of the same make and model.<br /><br /> Select this method when you want to provide configuration settings to a group of computers that have the same make and model. For example, you could deploy device drivers to the computers that all have the same make and model.|  

 You can use any combination of the methods listed in Table 181 to provide configuration settings for target computers. For example, one set of configuration settings could be provided based on the location of the target computer, while another set of configuration settings could be provided based on the role of the computer, and finally, a set of configuration settings could be provided based on the MAC address of the target computer.  

> [!NOTE]
>  Create the items in the Roles node before creating items beneath the other nodes (Computers, Locations, and Make and Model), because items in the other nodes can be associated with roles.  

###  <a name="ManagingConfigurationSettingsStoredintheMDTDB"></a> Managing Configuration Settings Stored in the MDT DB

####  <a name="ManageConfigurationSettingsStoredintheMDTDBUsingSQLServerManagementTools"></a> Manage Configuration Settings Stored in the MDT DB Using SQL Server Management Tools  
 Managing the configuration settings stored in the MDT DB using the Deployment Workbench is good for management of a limited number of database entries. However, if you need to add hundreds of entries (such as adding the configuration settings for the target computers) or if you want to perform a bulk update to the configuration settings, use SQL Server database management tools.  

 Perform bulk import and update of configuration settings in the MDT DB using:  

- **Microsoft Office system applications**. Microsoft Office Access® or Office Excel have data-manipulation features that allow you to directly modify tables in the MDT DB using tools with which you are already familiar.  

- **bcp utility (Bcp.exe)**. This bulk import/export tool allows you to import configuration settings to and export configuration settings from the tables in the MDT DB.  

- **Transact-SQL language in SQL Server**. The Transact-SQL language allows you to add, update, or delete entries in tables in the MDT DB.  

  You can review the tables, views, and other database objects in the MDT DB to determine the tables that you want to update. For more information on the tables and views in the MDT DB, see the section, "Tables and Views in the MDT DB", in the MDT document*Toolkit Reference*.  

###  <a name="ConfiguringtheMDTDeploymentProcesstoRetreiveConfigurationSettingsfromtheMDTDB"></a> Configuring the MDT Deployment Process to Retreive Configuration Settings from the MDT DB  
 Configure the MDT deployment process to access the MDT DB and retrieve the configuration settings stored in it by modifying CustomSettings.ini. You can modify CustomSettings.ini to allow the MDT deployment process to access the MDT DB using any combination of the following methods:  

-   Use the Configure DB Wizard in the Deployment Workbench as described in [Configure the Retreival of Configuration Settings from the MDT DB Using the Configure DB Wizard](#ConfiguretheRetreivalofConfigurationSettingsfromtheMDTDBUsingtheConfigureDBWizard).  

-   Directly modify the CustomSettings.ini file as described in [Configure the Retreival of Configuration Settings from the MDT DB by Directly Modifying the CustomSettings.ini File](#ConfiguretheRetreivalofConfigurationSettingsfromtheMDTDBbyDirectlyModifyingtheCustomSettings.iniFile).  

####  <a name="ConfiguretheRetreivalofConfigurationSettingsfromtheMDTDBUsingtheConfigureDBWizard"></a> Configure the Retrieval of Configuration Settings from the MDT DB Using the Configure DB Wizard  
 The Configure DB Wizard in Deployment Workbench provides a graphical interface for configuring the MDT deployment process to access the MDT DB. The advantages of using this wizard is that it helps reduce the:  

1. Possibility of configuration errors in the CustomSettings.ini file  

2. Effort required to modify the CustomSettings.ini file to enable retrieval of configuration settings from the MDT DB  

   The disadvantage of using the Configure DB Wizard is that it does not allow you to access any additional database objects that you have created, such as tables, views, or stored procedures. However, the wizard recognizes any columns that you have added to the existing tables and views.  

   In most instances, use the Configure DB Wizard to modify the CustomSettings.ini file. Only make direct modifications to the CustomSettings.ini file if you have added database objects, such as tables, views, or stored procedures.  

   Run the Configure DB Wizard for each deployment share defined in the Deployment Workbench that will be updated.  

###### To configure CustomSettings.ini for database queries using the Configure DB Wizard in the Deployment Workbench  

1. Click **Start**, and then point to **All Programs**. Point to **Microsoft Deployment Toolkit**, and then click **Deployment Workbench**.  

2. In the Deployment Workbench console tree, go to Deployment Workbench/Deployment Shares/*deployment_share*/Advanced Configuration/Database (where *deployment_share* is the name of the deployment share to which you will add the application).  

3. In the Actions pane, click **Configure Database Rules**.  

    The Configure DB Wizard starts.  

4. Complete the **Computer Options** wizard page using the information in Table 187, and then click **Next**.

####  <a name="ConfiguretheRetreivalofConfigurationSettingsfromtheMDTDBbyDirectlyModifyingtheCustomSettings.iniFile"></a> Configure the Retreival of Configuration Settings from the MDT DB by Directly Modifying the CustomSettings.ini File  
 The Configure DB Wizard in the Deployment Workbench provides the method that requires the least effort, requires minimal knowledge about how the CustomSettings.ini file is modified, and minimizes the risk of configuration errors. However, if you need to create custom queries for information, you can modify CustomSettings.ini to return the proper query results.  

> [!NOTE]
>  Although it is possible to manually customize the CustomSettings.ini file to retrieve configuration settings from the MDT DB without running the Configure DB Wizard, it is recommend that you run the Configure DB Wizard, and then modify the CustomSettings.ini file to meet your needs.  

 Directly modify the CustomSettings.ini file to configure the retrieval of configuration settings from the MDT DB by performing the following steps:  

-   Review the CustomSettings.ini file after running the Configure DB Wizard as a starting point for customization as described in [Review the CustomSettings.ini File After Running the Configure DB Wizard](#ReviewtheCustomSettings.iniFileAfterRunningtheConfigureDBWizard).  

-   Configure the properties in the CustomSettings.ini file that are used to create a SQL query as described in [Configure Properties That Are Used to Create an SQL Query](#ConfigurePropertiesThatAreUsedtoCreateanSQLQuery).  

-   Configure the properties in the CustomSettings.ini file that are used for deployment to a specific computer as described in [Configure Properties That Are Used for Deployment to a Specific Computer](#ConfigurePropertiesThatAreUsedforDeploymenttoaSpecificComputer).  

-   Configure the properties in the CustomSettings.ini file that are used for deployment by location as described in [Configure Properties That Are Used for Deployment by Location](#ConfigurePropertiesThatAreUsedforDeploymentbyLocation).  

-   Configure the properties in the CustomSettings.ini file that are used for deployment by computer make and model as described in [Configure Properties That Are Used for Deployment by Computer Make and Model](#ConfigurePropertiesThatAreUsedforDeploymentbyComputerMakeandModel).  

-   Configure the properties in the CustomSettings.ini file that are used for deployment by role as described in [Configure Properties That Are Used for Deployment by Role](#ConfigurePropertiesThatAreUsedforDeploymentbyRole).

#####  <a name="ConfigurePropertiesThatAreUsedtoCreateanSQLQuery"></a> Configure Properties That Are Used to Create an SQL Query  
 The Configure DB Wizard creates entries in the CustomSettings.ini file that are used to build an SQL query. Table 191 lists the MDT properties that are used to create the query. For more information on the properties in Table 191, see the corresponding section for each property in the section, "Properties", in the MDT document *Toolkit Reference*.  

### Table 191. Properties That Are Used to Create an SQL Query  

|Property|Description|  
|--------------|-----------------|  
|**SQLServer** |Specifies the name of the computer running SQL Server to use in the query|  
|**Instance** |Specifies the name of the SQL Server instance on the computer specified in the **SQLServer** property. If you are using:<br /><br /> - SQL Server installed as the default instances, you can leave **Instance** blank<br /><br /> - SQL Server Express, type **SQLExpress** for the instance name|  
|**Database** |Specifies the name of the MDT DB in the SQL Server instance specified in the **Instance** property.|  
|**Netlib** |Specifies the network library to be used in connecting to the MDT DB specified in the **Database** property and can be either Named Pipes (DBNDPNTW) or TCP/IP Sockets (DBMSSOCN).|  
|**SQLShare** |Specifies a network shared folder on the computer specified in the **SQLServer** property, which is used when performing user authentication using Windows Integrated Authentication with Named Pipes protocol.|  
|**Table** |Specifies the table or view to be used in the query. If you specify the **Table** property, you cannot specify the **StoredProcedure** property, too: You must specify one or the other.|  
|**StoredProcedure** |Specifies the stored procedure to be used in the query. If you specify the **StoredProcedure** property, you cannot specify the **Table** property, too: You must specify one or the other.|  
|**Parameters** |Specifies the selection criteria for returning rows from the query. Conceptually, this property is the **WHERE** clause in an SQL **SELECT** statement.|  
|**ParameterCondition** |Specifies the Boolean operation to be performed when you specify more than one selection criterion in the **Parameters** property. You can select either Boolean **AND** (the default) or **OR** operations. If you want to use a Boolean **OR** operation, you must specify **ParameterCondition=OR**.|  
|**Order** |Specifies the sort order of the rows returned from the query. Conceptually, this property is the **ORDER BY** clause in an SQL **SELECT** statement.|  

> [!NOTE]
>  The SQL query that these properties create returns all columns from the table or view specified in the **Table** property.  

 Most of these properties in Table 191 were configured when you created the MDT DB. Listing 15 provides an example of CustomSettings.ini file that creates an SQL query that returns all the configuration information in the Computers view for a computer that matches the **SerialNumber** or **AssetTag** of the computer being deployed.  

 **Listing 15. The CustomSettings.ini File After the Configure DB Wizard Has Finished**  

```  
[Settings]  
Priority=CSettings, Default  

[Default]  
OSInstall=YES  

[CSettings]  
SQLServer=NYC-SQL-01  
Instance=SQLEXPRESS  
Database=MDTDB  
Netlib=DBNMPNTW  
SQLShare=SQL$  
Table=ComputerSettings  
Parameters=UUID, AssetTag, SerialNumber, MacAddress  
ParameterCondition=OR  

```  

 The Priority line in the CustomSettings.ini file contains the `Computers` value, which directs MDT to process the `[CSettings]` section later in the CustomSettings.ini file. The properties in the `[CSettings]` section performs the query and returns the result set from the query to be used during the MDT deployment process, such as the computer name or IP address of the target computer.  

 You can review the tables and views in the MDT DB to determine the columns you want to reference in the **Parameters** property. For more information on the tables and views in the MDT DB, see the section, "Tables and Views in the MDT DB", in the MDT document *Toolkit Reference*.  

#####  <a name="ConfigurePropertiesThatAreUsedforDeploymenttoaSpecificComputer"></a> Configure Properties That Are Used for Deployment to a Specific Computer

 For more information about the database view and tables that the Deployment Workbench manages, see the section, "Tables and Views in the MDT DB", in the MDT document *Toolkit Reference*.  

###  <a name="ExtendingtheMDTDBSchema"></a> Extending the MDT DB Schema  
 Although the MDT DB contains most of the common configuration settings that you would need in your deployment, there may be instances in which you need to extend the information associated with one or more of the entities in the MDT DB, such as computers, roles, locations, or the makes and models.  

 If so, you must extend the schema for one or more of the tables and views in the MDT DB. If you extend the schema for the tables, you might also need to modify the views that depend on those tables. You extend the schema for the:  

- Tables using the Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio or the **ALTER TABLE** Transact-SQL statement  

- Views using the SQL Server Management Studio or the **ALTER VIEW** Transact-SQL statement  

  To extend the schema of the MDT DB, review the tables and views in the MDT DB to determine which you need to modify. For more information on the tables and views in the MDT DB, see the section, "Tables and Views in the MDT DB", in the MDT document *Toolkit Reference*.  

##### To extend the schema of the MDT DB  

1.  Determine the tables and views to be modified by reviewing the schema of the MDT DB as described in [Determine the Tables and Views to Be Modified](#DeterminetheTablesandViewstoBeModified).  

2.  Create a backup of the existing MDT DB as described in [Create a Backup of the MDT DB](#CreateaBackupoftheMDTDB).  

3.  Modify the tables using SQL Server Management Studio or the **ALTER** Transact-SQL statement as described in [Modify the Table](#ModifytheTable).  

4.  Modify and refresh the views that are dependent on the table and in which you want to return the new column in the result set as described in [Modify and Refresh the Dependent Views](#ModifyandRefreshtheDependentViews).  

5.  Reference the new column in the CustomSettings.ini file as described in [Reference the New Column in the CustomSettings.ini File](#ReferencetheNewColumnintheCustomSettings.iniFile).  

6.  Create a task sequence step that references the new column as described in [Reference the New Column in a Task Sequence Step](#ReferencetheNewColumninaTaskSequenceStep).  

####  <a name="DeterminetheTablesandViewstoBeModified"></a> Determine the Tables and Views to Be Modified  
 Determine the tables and views to be modified by reviewing the schema of the tables and views in the MDT DB. The table most commonly modified is **Settings**, which is common to all views, such as the **ComputerSettings** or **LocationSettings**.  

> [!TIP]
>  the views provided with MDT do not require modification, because they already return all columns.  

 For more information on the tables and views in the MDT DB, see the section, "Tables and Views in the MDT DB", in the MDT document Toolkit *Reference*.  

> [!TIP]
>  To determine which views are dependent on a table, look at the Transact-SQL statements used to create the view by right-clicking the view, and then clicking **Edit**.  

 **Example: How Woodgrove Bank Determined the Tables and Views to Be Modified**  

 Woodgrove Bank has decided that it needs to configure the antivirus server based on the location of a target computer. To do this, the bank's IT pros need to add an antivirus server configuration setting for each location that they define in the MDT DB.  

 To make the antivirus server information available, they must:  

-   Modify the **Settings** table  

-   Retrieve the information through the **LocationSettings** view  

####  <a name="CreateaBackupoftheMDTDB"></a> Create a Backup of the MDT DB  
 As a best practice, create a backup of the MDT DB before modifying the tables and views in it. Create a backup of the MDT DB using:  

-   **SQL Server Management Studio**. For more information on how to perform database backups using this method, see "How to: Back Up a Database (SQL Server Management Studio)" in SQL Server Books Online, included with SQL Server.  

-   **Existing SQL Server backup solution in your organization**. For more information on how to perform database backups using this method, see the documentation for your backup solution, or contact your DBA.  

####  <a name="ModifytheTable"></a> Modify the Table  
 You modify the table by adding new columns to it. You add new columns to tables in the MDT DB using:  

- **SQL Server Management Studio**. For more information on how to add a column using SQL Server Management Studio, see "How to: Insert Columns into Tables (Visual Database Tools)" in SQL Server Books Online, included with SQL Server.  

- **ALTER TABLE Transact-SQL statement**. For more information on how to add a column using the **ALTER TABLE** Transact-SQL statement, see "ALTER TABLE (Transact-SQL)" in SQL Server Books Online, included with SQL Server.  

- **Other SQL Server management tools**. For more information on how to perform this task using other SQL Server management tools, see the documentation for the corresponding tool.  

  To add a new column to a table, you need to know:  

- The columns that you will add to the table  

- The SQL Server data type for each column you will add to the table  

- If the new column allows Null values  

- The default value for the new column (optional)  

- Check constraints for the new column (optional)  

  For more information on how to determine what to use for each item in the previous list, see the section, "Table Column Properties (SQL Server Management Studio)," in SQL Server Books Online, included with SQL Server.  

  **Example: How Woodgrove Bank Modified Tables**  

  Woodgrove Bank will add a new column to the **Settings** table called **AVServer**. The **AVServer** column will contain the computer name of the antivirus server for each location specified in the **LocationIdentity** table. Woodgrove Bank has decided to create the **AVServer** column using the information in Table 196.  

### Table 196. Information for the AVServer Column  

|Property|Value|  
|--------------|-----------|  
|**Name** |AVServer|  
|**Allow Nulls** |Yes|  
|**Data Type** |char(20)|  

####  <a name="ModifyandRefreshtheDependentViews"></a> Modify and Refresh the Dependent Views  
 After the column has been added to the table, modify any views you want to display for the newly created column. Typically, you would add the new column to custom views that you have created.  

> [!NOTE]
>  The views provided with MDT do not require modifications, because all these views already return all columns. If you have not created custom views, you can skip this step.  

 Modify the dependent views in the MDT DB using:  

- **SQL Server Management Studio**. For more information on how to add a column using SQL Server Management Studio, see the section, "Working with Views (Visual Database Tools)," in SQL Server Books Online, included with SQL Server.  

- **ALTER VIEW Transact-SQL statement**. For more information on how to drop a view using the **ALTER VIEW** Transact-SQL statement, see the section, "ALTER View (Transact-SQL)," in SQL Server Books Online, included with SQL Server.  

- **Other SQL Server management tools**. For more information on how to perform this task using other SQL Server management tools, see the documentation for the corresponding tool.  

  To modify the dependent view, you need to know:  

- The columns that you will add to the view  

- The SQL **SELECT** statement used to create the view  

  For more information on determining what to use of each of the items in the previous list, see the section, "Modifying Views," in SQL Server Books Online, included with SQL Server.  

  Even if the views do not require modification, refresh all views that reference modified tables by running the **sp_refreshview** stored procedure. The**sp_refreshview** stored procedure is required to update views when the columns in dependent tables or views have changed. For more information about the **sp_refreshview** stored procedure, see the section, "sp_refreshview (Transact-SQL)," in SQL Server Books Online, included with SQL Server.  

  **Example: How Woodgrove Bank Modified the Dependent Views**  

  Woodgrove Bank does not need to modify any views, as the **LocationSettings** view already returns all columns from the **Settings** table. However, Woodgrove Bank ran the **sp_refreshview** stored procedure to refresh the **ComputerSettings**, **LocationSettings**, **MakeModelSettings**, or **RoleSettings** views, which reference the Settings table. This allows all the views to return the computer name of the antivirus server, if required.  

####  <a name="ReferencetheNewColumnintheCustomSettings.iniFile"></a> Reference the New Column in the CustomSettings.ini File  
 After you have added the column to the table and modified the appropriate views, configure the CustomSettings.ini file to reference the new column. To reference the new column in the CustomSettings.ini file, perform the following steps:  

1. Add a reference to the query section on the **Priority** line in the CustomSettings.ini file, if required.  

    This reference initiates the query defined in the query section that you will create in a later step. This step may not be necessary if CustomSettings.ini already has an existing query for the view or table referenced in the query.  

2. Add the new column name to the **Properties** line in the CustomSettings.ini file.  

    This reference informs MDT to resolve the value for **AVServer** and create a task sequence variable of the same name. The task sequence variable can then be referenced in a task sequence step.  

3. Create a query section that was referenced in step 1, which queries the appropriate table or view.  

   **Example: How Woodgrove Bank Referenced the New Column in the CustomSettings.ini File**  

   Woodgrove Bank queries the **LocationSettings** view to return the antivirus server for a particular location. The **LSettings** query already exists in the CustomSettings.ini file after running the Configure DB Wizard. As shown in Listing 16, all Woodgrove Bank needs to do is add **AVServer** to the `Priority` line so that MDT creates a task sequence variable of the same name.  

   **Listing 16. CustomSettings.ini File to Retrieve Antivirus Server for Woodgrove Bank**  

```  
[Settings]  
Priority=LSettings, Default  
Properties=AVServer  

[Default]  
OSInstall=YES  

[LSettings]  
SQLServer=NYC-SQL-01  
Instance=SQLExpress  
Database=MDTDB  
Netlib=DBNMPNTW  
SQLShare=SQL$  
Table=LocationSettings  
Parameters=DefaultGateway  
```  

####  <a name="ReferencetheNewColumninaTaskSequenceStep"></a> Reference the New Column in a Task Sequence Step  
 Now that the CustomSettings.ini file is modified to return the configuration settings from the new column, you are ready to reference the new column in a task sequence step. You reference the new column as a task sequence variable in the task sequence step. The variable will have the same name as the column. For example, if you create a column named **Zip_Code**, the task sequence variable will be named **Zip_Code**.  

 **Example: How Woodgrove Bank Referenced the New Column in a Task Sequence Step**  

 Woodgrove Bank creates a custom task sequence step to run the antivirus setup program. As a part of the antivirus setup program, the antivirus server name can be provided by using the **–server** parameter and referencing the new column name as a task sequence variable (%AVSERVER%). The command line used to run the antivirus setup program is:  

 `avsetup.exe -server %AVSERVER%`  

##  <a name="MonitoringMDTDeployments"></a> Monitoring MDT Deployments  
 You can monitor MDT deployments using the monitoring feature supported by the MDT scripts and the Deployment Workbench. The MDT deployment monitoring feature allows you to view the MDT deployment process for LTI, ZTI, and UDI deployments.

##  <a name="SupportingWindowsREandDaRT"></a> Supporting Windows RE and DaRT  
 MDT integrates with Windows RE and DaRT to provide enhanced support and troubleshooting features. MDT support for Windows RE and DaRT is as follows:  

-   LTI supports Windows RE and DaRT in LTI boot images and on the recovery partition on the target computer as described in [Supporting Windows RE and DaRT in LTI](#SupportingWindowsREandDaRTinLTI).  

-   ZTI and UDI support DaRT in boot images as described in [Supporting DaRT in ZTI and UDI Boot Images](#SupportingDaRTinZTIandUDIBootImages).  

###  <a name="SupportingWindowsREandDaRTinLTI"></a> Supporting Windows RE and DaRT in LTI  
 MDT supports the ability to deploy Windows RE partitions to computers. In addition, if your organization is licensed for the [Microsoft Desktop Optimization Package](/microsoft-desktop-optimization-pack/) (MDOP), you can include DaRT in the Windows RE partitions.  

> [!NOTE]
>  MDT does not support Windows RE in Windows 7 when using the Windows ADK.  

##### Provide support for Windows RE and DaRT by performing the following steps:  

1.  Enable Windows RE support on target computers by installing the MDT-enabled boot image to the target computer as described in [Enable Windows RE Support in LTI](#EnableWindowsRESupportinLTI).  

2.  Enable DaRT support on target computers by installing DaRT along with Windows RE as described in [Enable DaRT Support in LTI](#EnableDaRTSupportinLTI).  

3.  Customize the DaRT configuration when DaRT is integrated with LTI as described in [Customize DaRT When Integrated with LTI](#CustomizeDaRTWhenIntegratedwithLTI).  

####  <a name="EnableWindowsRESupportinLTI"></a> Enable Windows RE Support in LTI  
 Windows RE helps users troubleshoot and recover from startup-related problems on their computers. When a deployment share is updated, Deployment Workbench automatically generates .iso and .wim files that contain Windows RE support.  

> [!NOTE]
>  You must import the entire Windows 7 installation files to a deployment share to support Windows RE. Otherwise, Windows 7 is installed without Windows RE support.  

 While running the LTI task sequence, the **Add Windows Recovery (WinRE)** task sequence step is responsible for:

- Installing the appropriate .wim image to the active partition  

- Modifying the BCD file so that a user can choose to start Windows RE by pressing F8 as Windows is starting.  

  The **Add Windows Recovery (WinRE)** task sequence step runs when the **PrepareWinRE** property is set to a value of **YES**. For more information about the **PrepareWinRE** property, see the "PrepareWinRE" property in the MDT document *Toolkit Reference*.  

####  <a name="EnableDaRTSupportinLTI"></a> Enable DaRT Support in LTI  
 DaRT is included as a part of the [Microsoft Desktop Optimization Package](/microsoft-desktop-optimization-pack/), which is provided as a part of Microsoft Software Assurance. You can include DaRT in the Windows RE partitions.  

 The following is a summary of the DaRT features:  

- Includes 14 administrative, system, and network tools.  

- Provides many options for recovery, even when Windows Safe mode or normal startup will not function  

- Provides an easy-to-use, offline boot environment that helps IT teams quickly restart computers  

- Helps recover deleted files and reset lost or forgotten local passwords, even the administrator's  

  Enable DaRT support in LTI for:  

- DaRT version 7 (used with Windows 7) as described in [Enable DaRT 7 Support in LTI](#EnableDaRT7SupportinLTI)  

- DaRT version 8 (used with Windows 8) as described in [Enable DaRT 8 Support in LTI](#EnableDaRT8SupportinLTI)  

#####  <a name="EnableDaRT7SupportinLTI"></a> Enable DaRT 7 Support in LTI  
 DaRT version 7 is for use with Windows 7. For information on how to enable DaRT version 8 for use with Windows 8, see [Enable DaRT 8 Support in LTI](#EnableDaRT8SupportinLTI).  

###### To enable DaRT 7 support in LTI  

1.  Perform an administrative installation of DaRT on the computer running the Deployment Workbench.  

     By default, if you do a traditional installation of DaRT, the processor architecture of DaRT is the same as the processor architecture of the operating system where you installed DaRT. For example, if you install DaRT on a 64-bit operating system, you will have a 64-bit version of DaRT.  

     Performing an administrative installation allows you to install both 32-bit and 64-bit versions of DaRT. With an administrative installation the folder structures for both processor architectures are created, but none of the shortcuts are created.  

     Perform an administrative installation of DaRT by running the following command from a command prompt:  

     `msiexec.exe /a MSDart70.msi`  

2.  Copy the 32-bit version of Tools.cab file from the DaRT administrative installation to the Tools\x86 folder in a deployment share.  

3.  Copy the 64-bit version of Tools.cab file from the DaRT administrative installation to the Tools\x64 folder in a deployment share.  

4.  Click **Start**, and then point to **All Programs**. Point to **Microsoft Deployment Toolkit**, and then click **Deployment Workbench**.  

5.  In the Deployment Workbench console tree, go to Deployment Workbench/Deployment Shares  

6.  In the details pane, click ***deployment_share*** (where *deployment_share* is the name of the deployment share for which you want to enable DaRT support).  

7.  In the Actions pane, click **Properties**.  

     The ***deployment_share*** **Properties** dialog box appears (where *deployment_share* is the name of the deployment share for which you want to enable DaRT support).  

8.  In the ***deployment_share*** **Properties** dialog box, on the **Windows PE** tab, select **platform** (where *deployment_share* is the name of the deployment share for which you want to enable DaRT support and *platform* is the processor architecture platform for which you want to enable DaRT support), select the **Microsoft Diagnostics and Recovery Toolkit (DaRT)** check box, and then click **OK**.  

9. Update the deployment share.  

     As a part of updating the deployment share, the DaRT files are integrated with the Lite Touch Windows PE .wim files, which automatically include Windows RE. When the .wim files are installed on the target computer, DaRT support will automatically be included.  

    > [!NOTE]
    >  For more information about updating a deployment share see [Update a Deployment Share in the Deployment Workbench](#UpdateaDeploymentShareintheDeploymentWorkbench).  

10. Close all open windows and dialog boxes.

 DaRT version 8 is for use with Windows 8. For information on how to enable DaRT 7 for use with Windows 7, see [Enable DaRT 7 Support in LTI](#EnableDaRT7SupportinLTI).  

###### To enable DaRT 8 support in LTI  

1.  Perform an administrative installation of DaRT on the computer running the Deployment Workbench.  

     By default, if you perform a traditional installation of DaRT, the processor architecture of DaRT is the same as the processor architecture of the operating system on which you installed DaRT. For example, if you install DaRT on a 64-bit operating system, you will have a 64-bit version of DaRT.  

     Performing an administrative installation allows you to install both 32-bit and 64-bit versions of DaRT. With an administrative installation, the folder structures for both processor architectures are created, but none of the shortcuts are created.  

     Perform an administrative installation of DaRT by running the following command from a command prompt:  

     `msiexec.exe /a MSDart80.msi`  

2.  If the computer on which you installed MDT is running Windows 8, you can proceed to step 5.  

     MDT automatically performs the following two steps if you install DaRT 8 on the computer running Windows 8 and MDT.  

3.  Copy the Toolsx86.cab file from the DaRT administrative installation to the Tools\x86 folder in a deployment share.  

    > [!TIP]
    >  By default, the administrative installation of DaRT installs the Toolsx86.cab file in C:\Program Files\Microsoft DaRT 8\v8.  

4.  Copy the Toolsx64.cab file from the DaRT administrative installation to the Tools\x64 folder in a deployment share.  

    > [!TIP]
    >  By default, the administrative installation of DaRT installs the Toolsx64.cab file in C:\Program Files\Microsoft DaRT 8\v8.  

5.  Click **Start**, and then point to **All Programs**. Point to **Microsoft Deployment Toolkit**, and then click **Deployment Workbench**.  

6.  In the Deployment Workbench console tree, go to Deployment Workbench/Deployment Shares.

####  <a name="CustomizeDaRTWhenIntegratedwithLTI"></a> Customize DaRT When Integrated with LTI  
 You can customize DaRT, and then save the customizations in LTI so that the deployed partitions that include DaRT are configured consistently. You can do this by creating a new DaRT recovery image that includes the configuration settings you desire, then copying the DartConfig.dat file from the newly configured DaRT recovery image to an LTI deployment share.  

###### To customize DaRT when integrated with LTI  

1.  Install DaRT on the computer where you installed MDT.  

2.  Create a new DaRT recovery image using the DaRT Recovery Image Wizard.  

     While running the DaRT Recovery Image Wizard, make the configuration settings that you wish to have applied to your environment. Select to save the DaRT recovery image as an .iso file.  

     For more information about how to create a new DaRT recovery image for:  

    -   DaRT 7, see [How to create & test Diagnostics & Recovery Toolkit (DaRT 7) Recovery Image–Part I](/archive/blogs/aviraj/how-to-create-test-diagnostics-recovery-toolkit-dart-7-recovery-imagepart-i).  

    -   DaRT 8, see the section, "Create the DaRT 8 Recovery Image," in the *Microsoft Diagnostics and Recovery Toolset Administrator's Guide*, which is included with DaRT 8.  

3.  Extract the DartConfig.dat file from the .iso file created in the previous step.  

4.  Copy the DartConfig.dat file extracted in the previous step into the *installation_folder*\Templates folder (where *installation_folder* is the folder where you installed MDT) on the computer where you installed MDT.  

5.  Update the deployment share in the Deployment Workbench to create a LTI boot image that includes the customized DartConfig.dat file.  

     For more information about updating a deployment share, see [Update a Deployment Share in the Deployment Workbench](#UpdateaDeploymentShareintheDeploymentWorkbench).  

###  <a name="SupportingDaRTinZTIandUDIBootImages"></a> Supporting DaRT in ZTI and UDI Boot Images  
 MDT supports DaRT version 7 (for Windows 7) and DaRT version 8 (for Windows 8) in ZTI and UDI boot images. This support makes DaRT features available when the ZTI or UDI boot images are running on the target computers.  

 After a ZTI or UDI boot image is enabled for DaRT, the **Use Toolkit Package** task sequence step will recognize that the DaRT remote control files are present and will automatically start the DaRT remote control agent. The DaRT remote control agent provides remote control of the target computer during the deployment process, which helps troubleshoot deployment problems.  

 Enable DaRT support in ZTI and UDI boot images for:  

-   DaRT version 7 (used with Windows 7) as described in [Enable DaRT 7 Support in ZTI and UDI Boot Images](#EnableDaRT7SupportinZTIandUDIBootImages).  

-   DaRT version 8 (used with Windows 8) as described in [Enable DaRT 8 Support in ZTI and UDI Boot Images](#EnableDaRT8SupportinZTIandUDIBootImages).  

####  <a name="EnableDaRT7SupportinZTIandUDIBootImages"></a> Enable DaRT 7 Support in ZTI and UDI Boot Images  
 DaRT version 7 is for use with Windows 7. For information on how to enable DaRT version 8 for use with Windows 8, see [Enable DaRT 8 Support in ZTI and UDI Boot Images](#EnableDaRT8SupportinZTIandUDIBootImages).  

###### To enable DaRT 7 support in ZTI and UDI Boot Images  

1.  Perform an administrative installation of DaRT on the computer running the Deployment Workbench.  

     By default, if you do a traditional installation of DaRT, the processor architecture of DaRT is the same as the processor architecture of the operating system where you installed DaRT. For example, if you install DaRT on a 64-bit operating system, you will have a 64-bit version of DaRT.  

     Performing an administrative installation allows you to install both 32-bit and 64-bit versions of DaRT. With an administrative installation the folder structures for both processor architectures are created, but none of the shortcuts are created.  

     Perform an administrative installation of DaRT by running the following command from a command prompt:  

     `msiexec.exe /a MSDart70.msi`  

2.  Copy the 32-bit version of Tools.cab file from the DaRT administrative installation to the *installation_folder*\Templates\Distribution\Tools\x86 folder (where *installation_folder* is the folder where you installed MDT).  

3.  Copy the 64-bit version of Tools.cab file from the DaRT administrative installation to the *installation_folder*\Templates\Distribution\Tools\x64 folder (where *installation_folder* is the folder where you installed MDT).  

4.  Run the Create Boot Image using MDT wizard to generate the boot image.  

     While running the Create Boot Image using MDT wizard, on the **General Settings: Components** wizard page, select the **Microsoft Diagnostics and Recovery Toolkit (DaRT)** check box.  

     For information about how to run the Create Boot Image using MDT wizard for Configuration Manager, see [Creating ZTI Boot Images in Configuration Manager](#CreatingZTIBootImagesinConfigurationManager)  

5.  Close all open windows and dialog boxes.  

####  <a name="EnableDaRT8SupportinZTIandUDIBootImages"></a> Enable DaRT 8 Support in ZTI and UDI Boot Images  
 DaRT version 8 is for use with Windows 8. For information on how to enable DaRT 7 for use with Windows 7, see [Enable DaRT 7 Support in ZTI and UDI Boot Images](#EnableDaRT7SupportinZTIandUDIBootImages).  

 You enable DaRT support based on the operating system running on the computer on which you installed MDT. DaRT 8 can only be installed on Windows 8. If you install MDT on a computer running:  

-   Windows 8, then install DaRT on the same computer, and MDT will automatically copy the necessary files to support DaRT 8 as described in [Enable DaRT 8 Support in ZTI and UDI Boot Images for Windows 8 Operating Systems](#EnableDaRT8SupportinZTIandUDIBootImagesforWindows8OperatingSystems).  

-   Operating systems prior to Windows 8, then perform an administrative installation on a computer running Windows 8, and then copy the Toolsx86.cab and Toolsx64.cab files to the computer running MDT as described in [Enable DaRT 8 Support in ZTI and UDI Boot Images for Operating Systems Prior to Windows 8](#EnableDaRT8SupportinZTIandUDIBootImagesforOperatingSystemsPriortoWindows8).  

#####  <a name="EnableDaRT8SupportinZTIandUDIBootImagesforWindows8OperatingSystems"></a> Enable DaRT 8 Support in ZTI and UDI Boot Images for Windows 8 Operating Systems  
 Enabling DaRT 8 support in ZTI and UDI boot images for Windows 8 Operating Systems  requires the installation of DaRT 8 on the computer on which you installed MDT. After DaRT 8 is installed, the Deployment Workbench in MDT automatically copies the necessary DaRT 8 files to the appropriate locations.  

###### To enable DaRT 8 support in ZTI and UDI boot images for Windows 8 operating systems  

1.  Install DaRT on the computer running MDT.  

     Install DaRT by running the following command from a command prompt:  

     `msiexec.exe /i MSDart80.msi`  

2.  Start the Deployment Workbench.  

     When the Deployment Workbench starts, MDT copies  the necessary DaRT files to the MDT installation. The Deployment workbench copies the:  

    -   Toolsx86.cab file from the DaRT installation to the *installation_folder*\Templates\Distribution\Tools\x86 folder (where *installation_folder* is the folder where you installed MDT).  

    -   Toolsx64.cab file from the DaRT installation to the *installation_folder*\Templates\Distribution\Tools\x64 folder (where *installation_folder* is the folder where you installed MDT).  

3.  Run the Create Boot Image Using the MDT Wizard to generate the boot image.  

     While running the Create Boot Image Using MDT Wizard, on the General Settings: Components wizard page, select the **Microsoft Diagnostics and Recovery Toolkit 8 (DaRT 8)** check box.

#####  <a name="EnableDaRT8SupportinZTIandUDIBootImagesforOperatingSystemsPriortoWindows8"></a> Enable DaRT 8 Support in ZTI and UDI Boot Images for Operating Systems Prior to Windows 8  
 Enabling DaRT 8 support in ZTI and UDI boot images for operating systems prior to Windows 8 requires an administrative installation of DaRT 8 on a computer running an operating system prior to Windows 8. After DaRT 8 is installed, you will need to manually copy the DaRT 8 files to the appropriate locations on the computer running MDT.  

###### To enable DaRT 8 support in ZTI and UDI boot images for operating systems prior to Windows 8  

1.  Perform an administrative installation of DaRT on the computer running the Deployment Workbench.  

     By default, if you perform a traditional installation of DaRT, the processor architecture of DaRT is the same as the processor architecture of the operating system on which you installed DaRT. For example, if you install DaRT on a 64-bit operating system, you will have a 64-bit version of DaRT.  

     Performing an administrative installation allows you to install both 32-bit and 64-bit versions of DaRT. With an administrative installation the folder structures for both processor architectures are created, but none of the shortcuts are created.  

     Perform an administrative installation of DaRT by running the following command from a command prompt:  

     `msiexec.exe /a MSDart80.msi`  

2.  Copy the Toolsx86.cab file from the DaRT administrative installation to the *installation_folder*\Templates\Distribution\Tools\x86 folder (where *installation_folder* is the folder where you installed MDT).  

    > [!TIP]
    >  By default the administrative installation of DaRT installs the Toolsx86.cab file in C:\Program Files\Microsoft DaRT 8\v8.  

3.  Copy the Toolsx64.cab file from the DaRT administrative installation to the *installation_folder*\Templates\Distribution\Tools\x64 folder (where *installation_folder* is the folder where you installed MDT).  

    > [!TIP]
    >  By default the administrative installation of DaRT installs the Toolsx64.cab file in C:\Program Files\Microsoft DaRT 8\v8.  

4.  Run the Create Boot Image using MDT wizard to generate the boot image.  

     While running the Create Boot Image using MDT wizard, on the **General Settings: Components** wizard page, select the **Microsoft Diagnostics and Recovery Toolkit 8 (DaRT 8)** check box.  

     For information about how to run the Create Boot Image using MDT wizard for Configuration Manager, see [Creating ZTI Boot Images in Configuration Manager](#CreatingZTIBootImagesinConfigurationManager)  

5.  Close all open windows and dialog boxes.  

##  <a name="PreparingtheMDTMigrationResources"></a> Preparing the MDT Migration Resources  
 During deployment to the target computers, deployment scripts connect to the deployment shares and shared folders. Create accounts for the scripts to use when accessing these resources.  

 Prepare the MDT migration resources by:  

-   Creating additional shared folders as described in [Creating Additional Shared Folders](#CreatingAdditionalSharedFolders)  

-   Configuring shared folder permissions as described in [Configuring Shared Folder Permissions](#ConfiguringSharedFolderPermissions)  

-   Configuring access to other resources as described in [Configuring Access to Other Resources](#ConfiguringAccesstoOtherResources)  

###  <a name="CreatingAdditionalSharedFolders"></a> Creating Additional Shared Folders  
 Before starting the deployment, create additional shared folders in which to store the user state migration data and the deployment logs. Table 198 lists the shared folders that must be created and describes the purpose of each.  

### Table 198. Shared Folders and Their Descriptions  

|Shared folder|Description|  
|-------------------|-----------------|  
|MigData|Stores the user state migration data during the LTI deployment process.|  
|Logs|Stores the deployment logs during the LTI or ZTI deployment process. This folder is optional for either deployment.|  

> [!NOTE]
>  The files in Table 198 are recommended shared folder names. Use any name for these shared folders. However, the remainder of the deployment process refers to these shared folders by these names.  

###  <a name="ConfiguringSharedFolderPermissions"></a> Configuring Shared Folder Permissions  
 After creating additional shared folders listed in Table 198, configure the appropriate shared folder permissions. Ensure that unauthorized users are unable to access user state migration information and the deployment logs. Only the target computer creating the user state migration information and the deployment logs should have access to these folders.  

##### To configure the shared folder permissions for the folders listed in Table 198  

1. In Windows Explorer, right-click ***shared_folder*** (where *shared_folder* is one of the shared folders listed in Table 198), and then click **Properties**.  

2. On the **Security** tab, click **Advanced**.  

3. On the **Permissions** tab, clear the **Allow inheritable permissions from the parent to propagate to this object and all child objects** check box.  

4. In the **Security** dialog box, click **Remove**.  

5. On the **Permissions** tab, click **Add**.  

6. In the **Enter the object name to select** box, type **Authenticated Users**, and then click **OK**.  

7. In the **Permission Entry for *shared_folder*** dialog box (where *shared_folder* is one of the shared folders listed in Table 198), in the **Apply onto** list, click **This folder only**.  

8. In the **Permission Entry for *shared_folder*** dialog box (where *shared_folder* is one of the shared folders listed in Table 198), in the **Permissions** list, click **Allow for the Create Folders/Append Data permission**, and then click **OK**.  

9. On the **Permissions** tab, click **Add**.  

10. In the **Enter the object name to select** box, type **CREATOR OWNER**, and then click **OK**.  

     This action allows domain computers and domain users to access the subfolders they create.  

11. In the **Permission Entry for *shared_folder*** dialog box (where *shared_folder* is one of the shared folders listed in Table 198), in the **Apply onto** list, click **Subfolders and files only**.  

12. In the **Permission Entry for *shared_folder*** dialog box (where *shared_folder* is one of the shared folders listed in Table 198), in the **Permissions** list, click **Allow for the Full Control permission**, and then click **OK**.  

13. Repeat steps 10–13 for each group that will receive Administrator privileges.  

    The permissions set in these steps work for both LTI and ZTI deployments. In some instances, you may want to further restrict the user accounts that can access the shared folder. You can restrict user accounts for:  

-   LTI deployments by substituting **Authenticated Users** in the steps above with each account you want to have access  

-   ZTI deployments by substituting **Authenticated Users** in the steps above with a network access account in Configuration Manager  

###  <a name="ConfiguringAccesstoOtherResources"></a> Configuring Access to Other Resources  
 In addition to the shared folders just created, the MDT scripts might require access to other resources. The resources include application or database servers (such as Microsoft SQL Server or Microsoft Exchange Server).  

 Access is granted to the credentials specified in the:  

- **UserID**, **UserPassword**, and **UserDomain** properties for LTI deployments  

- Deployment Wizard for LTI deployments  

- Network access account used by the Configuration Manager client for ZTI deployments  

  Grant access to the following resources:  

- **MDT deployment share for LTI deployments**. Configure access to the deployment share created in the Deployment Workbench.  

- **Any resources accessed using the ZTIConnect.wsf script for LTI or ZTI deployments**. Configure access to resources that are referenced using the ZTIConnect.wsf script.  

  > [!NOTE]
  >  For further guidance on using the ZTIConnect.wsf script, see the MDT document *Microsoft Deployment Toolkit Samples Guide*.  

- **Any resources on application or database servers for LTI or ZTI deployments**. Configure access to applications or databases that are accessed through the **SQLServer**, **SQLShare**, and **Database** properties.  

  > [!NOTE]
  >  Other connections to the same servers, such as Named Pipes and RPC, use the same credentials listed above. Use the ZTIConnect.wsf script to establish these connections.  

##  <a name="PreparingWindowsDeploymentServices"></a> Preparing Windows Deployment Services  
 You can use Windows Deployment Services in conjunction with MDT to automatically initiate boot images on target computers. These boot images can be Windows PE images or custom images that can deploy operating systems directly to the target computers.  

 Prepare Windows Deployment Services for use with MDT by:  

-   Preparing Windows Deployment Services for use in LTI deployments as described in [Preparing Windows Deployment Services for LTI Deployments](#PreparingWindowsDeploymentServicesforLTIDeployments)  

-   Preparing Windows Deployment Services for use in ZTI deployments using Configuration Manager as described in [Preparing Windows Deployment Services for ZTI Deployments Using Configuration Manager](#PreparingWindowsDeploymentServicesforZTIDeploymentsUsingConfigurationManager)  

-   Preparing Windows Deployment Services for use in UDI deployments as described in [Preparing Windows Deployment Services for UDI Deployments](#PreparingWindowsDeploymentServicesforUDIDeployments)  

###  <a name="PreparingWindowsDeploymentServicesforLTIDeployments"></a> Preparing Windows Deployment Services for LTI Deployments  
 You can use Windows Deployment Services in LTI deployments in the following ways:  

- **Start Windows PE on the target computers**. The beginning of the New Computer deployment scenario and the second half of the Replace Computer deployment scenario both start the target computer in Windows PE. For these scenarios, you can automate starting Windows PE using Windows Deployment Services.  

- **Install images created in the Deployment Workbench on the target computers**. You can create custom WIM images in the Deployment Workbench that you can deploy directly to target computers using Windows Deployment Services.  

  For more information about setting up and configuring Windows Deployment Services, see:  

- [Windows Deployment Services](/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2012-R2-and-2012/hh831764(v=ws.11))  

- The Windows Deployment Services Help file, included in Windows Deployment Services  

  Prepare Windows Deployment Services for LTI deployments by:  

- Adding boot images created in the Deployment Workbench for LTI deployments to Windows Deployment Services as described in [Add LTI Boot Images to Windows Deployment Services](#AddLTIBootImagestoWindowsDeploymentServices)  

- Pre-staging target computers in Windows Deployment Services for LTI deployments as described in [Pre-stage Target Computers for Windows Deployment Services for LTI Deployments](#PrestageTargetComputersforWindowsDeploymentServicesforLTIDeployments)  

- Enabling Windows Deployment Services multicast deployment of images in Windows Deployment Services for LTI deployments as described in [Enable Windows Deployment Services Multicast Deployment for LTI Deployments](#EnableWindowsDeploymentServicesMulticastDeploymentforLTIDeployments)  

####  <a name="AddLTIBootImagestoWindowsDeploymentServices"></a> Add LTI Boot Images to Windows Deployment Services  
 You can add the LTI boot image WIM files in the Boot folder of a deployment share to Windows Deployment Services. Doing so allows Windows Deployment Services to automatically initiate LTI deployment by starting LTI boot images.  

> [!NOTE]
>  Add the LTI boot images only to Windows Deployment Services. You do not need to add operating system images from the Deployment Workbench.  

 You can add LTI boot images to Windows Deployment Services using the Windows Deployment Services management console or the WDSUTIL.exe tool.  

 For more information about adding an LTI boot image to Windows Deployment Services, see:  

-   "Add an Image," in Windows Deployment Services Help, which is included in Windows Deployment Services  

-   [Windows Deployment Services Getting Started Guide](/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2012-R2-and-2012/jj648426(v=ws.11))  

####  <a name="PrestageTargetComputersforWindowsDeploymentServicesforLTIDeployments"></a> Pre-stage Target Computers for Windows Deployment Services for LTI Deployments  
 You can pre-stage PXE client computers in AD DS domains. When target computers are pre-staged, the computer accounts exist in AD DS domains (also called *known computers*). Target computers that are not pre-staged do not have computer accounts in AD DS domains (also called unknown computers).  

> [!NOTE]
>  Responding to unknown computers is the preferred method for LTI deployments, because it is the simplest method. If you pre-stage the target computers, LTI is unable to use the pre-staged computer account. Only Windows Deployment Services can use the pre-staged computer accounts.  

 You can configure Windows Deployment Services to respond to computers that are known or unknown. Depending on the Windows Deployment Services configuration, you may need to pre-stage the target computers. Doing so authorizes Windows Deployment Services to deploy operating system images to the target computer.  

> [!NOTE]
>  If Windows Deployment Services is configured to respond to any computer (known or unknown), pre-staging the target computers is not necessary. LTI will not use a pre-staged computer account when joining the domain. Instead, LTI uses the computer name and credentials configured in the task sequence or through the rules process.  

###### To pre-stage the target computers for Windows Deployment Services  

1.  Click **Start**, point to **Administrative Tools**, and then click **Active Directory Users and Computers**.  

2.  In the console tree, right-click ***organizational_unit*** (where *organizational_unit* is the name of the OU that will contain the target computer), point to **New**, and then click **Computer**.  

3.  In the **New Object – Computer** dialog box, in the **Computer name** box, type ***computer_name*** (where *computer_name* is the name of the target computer), and then click **Next**.  

4.  In the **Managed** dialog box, select the **This is a managed computer** check box. In the **Computer's unique ID (GUID/UUID)** box, type ***guid_uuid*** (where *guid_uuid* is the GUID/UUID of the computer), and then click **Next**.  

5.  In the **Host server** dialog box, select one of the following options, and then click **Next**:  

    -   **Any available remote installation server**. This option specifies that this computer can be serviced by any Windows Deployment Services server.  

    -   **The following remote installation server**. This option designates a specific server to service the computer. Specify the FQDN of the server running Windows Deployment Services.  

6.  In the **New Object – Computer** dialog box, review the information displayed, and then click **Finish**.  

7.  Close all open windows.  

####  <a name="EnableWindowsDeploymentServicesMulticastDeploymentforLTIDeployments"></a> Enable Windows Deployment Services Multicast Deployment for LTI Deployments  
 Multicast deployment of LTI operating systems using Windows Deployment Services allows multiple computers to receive a single copy of an image, which reduces the amount of network traffic required when multiple computers need to receive the same image. By default, multicasting support is disabled in MDT.  

 For LTI deployments, the Deployment Workbench creates a multicast namespace for the deployment share. The images are transferred to the target computers using multicast from the deployment share, not from a Windows Deployment Services share.  

> [!NOTE]
>  MDT supports only the multicast transfer of images stored in the LTI$ distribution share. Images stored in Windows Deployment Services cannot be deployed using multicast transfer.  

 The multicast types available for use in LTI deployments include:  

- **Auto-Cast**. In this option, as soon as an applicable client computer requests an installation image, a multicast transmission of the selected image begins. Then, as other client computers request the same image, they are joined to the transmission that has already started.  

- **Scheduled-Cast**. This option sets the start criteria for the transmission based on the number of client computers requesting an image or a specific day and time.  

  MDT supports multicast-based deployments when MDT and the deployment share are installed on:  

- **The computer running Windows Deployment Services**. In this scenario, MDT is installed on a computer running Windows Server with the Windows Deployment Services role as described in [Enable Multicast Deployments with MDT Installed on the Same Computer as Windows Deployment Services](#EnableMulticastDeploymentswithMDTInstalledontheSameComputerasWindowsDeploymentServices).  

- **A computer other than the computer Windows Deployment Services is running on**. In this scenario, MDT and the deployment share are installed on a separate computer from the one running Windows Server with the Windows Deployment Services role as described in [Enable Multicast Deployments with MDT Installed on a Different Computer from Windows Deployment Services](#EnableMulticastDeploymentswithMDTInstalledonaDifferentComputerfromWindowsDeploymentServices).  

  > [!NOTE]
  >  If MDT is installed on a separate computer, you must install the Remote Server Administration Tools feature so that the WDSUTIL command-line utility is available.  

> [!NOTE]
>  You cannot use these scenarios to allow multicast for boot images, as the multicast client is not loaded until after Windows PE is running. LTI only uses multicast to transfer operating system WIM files.  

#####  <a name="EnableMulticastDeploymentswithMDTInstalledontheSameComputerasWindowsDeploymentServices"></a> Enable Multicast Deployments with MDT Installed on the Same Computer as Windows Deployment Services  
 In this scenario, MDT is installed on a computer running Windows Server  with the Windows Deployment Services server role. In this scenario, MDT can automatically configure Windows Deployment Services to support multicast deployments.  

###### To enable multicast deployments with MDT installed on the same computer as Windows Deployment Services  

1. Install Windows Server on the computer that is to be the deployment server.  

2. Install the Windows Deployment Services server role on the computer that is to be the deployment server.  

3. Install Windows ADK for Windows 8.1 on the computer that is to be the deployment server.  

4. Install MDT on the computer that is to be the deployment server.  

5. Start the Deployment Workbench.  

6. In the Deployment Workbench console tree, click **Deployment Shares**.  

7. In the details pane, right-click ***deployment_share*** (where *deployment_share* is the name of an existing deployment share for which multicast deployments will be enabled), and then click **Properties**.  

8. In the ***deployment_share*** **Properties** dialog box (where *deployment_share* is the name of an existing deployment share), on the **General** tab, select the **Enable multicast for this deployment share** check box, and then click **OK**.  

   > [!NOTE]
   >  The **Network (UNC) path** and **Local Path** text boxes on the **General** tab must contain valid paths for multicasting to function properly.  

9. In the Actions pane, click **Update Deployment Share**.  

   When completed, the Deployment Workbench creates an Auto-Cast Windows Deployment Services multicast transmission from the deployment share.  

#####  <a name="EnableMulticastDeploymentswithMDTInstalledonaDifferentComputerfromWindowsDeploymentServices"></a> Enable Multicast Deployments with MDT Installed on a Different Computer from Windows Deployment Services  
 In this scenario, Windows Deployment Services and Windows Server are all installed on the computer acting as the deployment server, but MDT is installed on another computer. In this configuration, remotely run the **WDSUTIL** command on the computer running Windows Deployment Services and Windows Server.  

###### To enable multicast deployments with MDT Installed on a different computer than Windows Deployment Services  

1. Install Windows Server on the computer hosting the deployment share.  

2. Install the Windows Deployment Services server role on the computer hosting the deployment share.  

3. Install Windows ADK for Windows 8.1 on a computer other than the computer hosting the deployment share.  

4. Install MDT on the same computer as in step 3.  

5. On the computer hosting the deployment share, in a Command Prompt window, type the following command, and then press ENTER (where *remote_server* is the name of the computer running Windows Server with the Windows Deployment Services server role and *deploy_share_path* is the fully qualified path to the root of the deployment share).  

    `wdsutil.exe /new-namespace /friendlyname:"BDD Share Deploy$" /server:remote_server /namespace:"Deploy$" /contentprovider:WDS /configstring:"deploy_share_path" /namespacetype:AutoCast`  

   When completed, the WDSUTIL tool creates an Auto-Cast Windows Deployment Services multicast transmission from the deployment share.  

###  <a name="PreparingWindowsDeploymentServicesforZTIDeploymentsUsingConfigurationManager"></a> Preparing Windows Deployment Services for ZTI Deployments Using Configuration Manager  
 For ZTI deployments using Configuration Manager, configure a Configuration Manager PXE service point on the computer on which Windows Deployment Services is installed. Doing so allows Configuration Manager to directly service PXE boot requests received by Windows Deployment Services as a PXE service point, which in turn allows target computers to boot images that Configuration Manager manages using PXE. The PXE service point is a feature of the distribution point site system role, which means that you will configure the computer running Windows Deployment Services as a distribution point site system role.  

 For more information about preparing Windows Deployment Services for ZTI deployments using Configuration Manager, see:  

-   "How to Deploy Operating Systems by Using PXE in Configuration Manager" in the Configuration Manager Documentation Library, included with Configuration Manager  

-   "Configuring Distribution Points to Accept PXE Requests" in the Configuration Manager Documentation Library, included with Configuration Manager  

> [!NOTE]
>  In addition to the methods described here, you can use traditional Windows Deployment Services methods for responding to PXE boot requests. For more information, see the Windows Deployment Services Help file included with Windows Deployment Services.  

###  <a name="PreparingWindowsDeploymentServicesforUDIDeployments"></a> Preparing Windows Deployment Services for UDI Deployments
