Each of these reference topics are discussed in subsequent sections.

## UDI Concepts

This section contains concepts that help describe UDI, the UDI Wizard, and the UDI Wizard Designer.

### Display Name

The display name is used to provide a user-friendly, descriptive name for a wizard page within the Page Library in the UDI Wizard Designer. The display name is displayed in blue text for each wizard page in the Page Library and on the **Flow** tab in the UDI Wizard Designer.

 When you add a page to the Page Library, you must provide the display name. After the wizard page is added to the Page Library, you cannot change the display name.

### Flow

The **Flow** tab displays the list of wizard pages within a UDI stage in the UDI Wizard Designer. You can use the **Flow** tab to perform the following tasks:

- Add a wizard page from the Page Library to a UDI stage by dragging the page from the Page Library to the UDI stage.

- Remove a wizard page from a UDI stage.

- Change the sequence of wizard pages within a UDI stage.

### Page Library

The Page Library contains all the pages currently loaded in the UDI Wizard Designer. When loading a UDI Wizard configuration file, all of the wizard pages defined in the configuration file are displayed to the Page Library. The Page Library shows the wizard pages in alphabetical order by page types. Each instance of a specific page type is listed under the page type.

 For example, you may need two different **WelcomePage** wizard pages for different stages. The two **WelcomePage** wizard pages will be listed under the **WelcomePage** wizard page type in the Page Library in the UDI Wizard Designer.

 In addition, each wizard page instance in the Page Library indicates how many times the wizard page is used in the stage flows. When you hover over a wizard page in the Page Library, a thumbnail of the wizard page is displayed along with the stages that include that page.

### Page Name

The page name is used to uniquely identify a wizard page within the Page Library in the UDI Wizard Designer. The *page name* is the name a UDI stage references so that the UDI Wizard knows which wizard page to display within a specific UDI stage. When you add a page to the Page Library, you must provide the page name. After the wizard page is added to the Page Library, you cannot change the page name. In the UDI Wizard Designer, the page name is shown at the bottom of each wizard page in the Page Library in smaller, non-bold text.

### Prestaged Media Deployments

Prestaged media support is an operating system deployment feature in Configuration Manager that allows an administrator to copy and apply prestage bootable media and an operating system image to a hard disk prior to the provisioning process. This work can reduce network traffic and the time needed for the provisioning process. Prestaged media can be deployed as part of the manufacturing process or at an enterprise staging center that is not connected to the Configuration Manager environment.

 For more information about prestaged media deployments, see the following resources:

- [Planning for Media Operating System Deployments in Configuration Manager](/previous-versions/system-center/system-center-2012-R2/hh499044(v=technet.10))

- [About Prestaged Media for Operating System Deployment](../osd/deploy-use/create-prestaged-media.md)

### Stage Group

Use a stage group to group one or more stages in the UDI Wizard Designer. UDI stage groups are loosely related to MDT deployment scenarios, but there is no one-to-one correlation between the two.

### Stage

A *stage* is a subset of all the pages in the UDI Wizard configuration file that an MDT deployment scenario uses. When you start the UDI Wizard using the **UDI Wizard** task sequence step, the **/stage** parameter specifies the stage to run, which in turn specifies the set of pages to use. You can preview how wizard pages will appear in a stage by selecting **Preview** in the **Preview Wizard** group on the Ribbon. You can use a UDI stage in more than one MDT deployment scenario, even though the UDI stage is defined only once in the UDI Wizard Designer. For example, the NewComputer stage can be used in the MDT New Computer and Replace Computer deployment scenarios.

### Task

*UDI tasks* are software that is run on a wizard page to perform specific functions. In some instances, these tasks are used to verify that the target computer is ready for deployment. Other tasks can be used to perform deployment steps, such as copying configuration or result files.

> [!NOTE]
>
> The **Next** button on the wizard page where the tasks are run will be disabled if any of the tasks finish with warning or error completion status.

 UDI includes several built-in tasks that allow you to perform most of the tasks necessary for deployment. For more information about the UDI built-in tasks, see [Built-in UDI Tasks](#built-in-udi-tasks).

 The **Shell Execute** built-in UDI task allows you to run any software (scripts) that can be initiated from a command line, such as Visual Basic or Windows PowerShell scripts. This functionality allows you create tasks using familiar scripting languages. For more information, see [Shell Execute Task](#shell-execute-task).

 If your requirements go beyond scripting, you can write custom UDI tasks. *UDI tasks* are DLLs written in C++ and implement the **ITask** interface. You register the DLL with the UDI Wizard Designer task library by creating a UDI Wizard Designer configuration (.config) file and placing it in the *installation_folder*\Bin\Config folder (where *installation_folder* is the folder in which you installed MDT). For more information on developing custom UDI tasks, see the section, "Creating Custom UDI Tasks", in the *User-Driven Installation Developers Guide*.

### UDI Task Sequence

You create a UDI task sequence using one of the following UDI-specific MDT task sequence templates, which run the UDI Wizard at the appropriate step in the task sequence:

- **User-Driven Installation Task Sequence.** This task sequence template is used for the New Computer, Refresh Computer, and Replace Computer MDT deployment scenarios.

- **User-Driven Installation Replace Task Sequence.** This task sequence template is the first step in a two-step process in the Replace Computer deployment scenario and is used to capture user state migration data. The second step in the two-step process is the User-Driven Installation Task Sequence task sequence template, which you use to deploy the target applications and operating system and restore the user state migration data saved during the first step of the process.

  For more information about UDI task sequence templates, see the section, "Identify the UDI Task Sequence Templates in MDT", in the MDT document *Using the Microsoft Deployment Toolkit*. For more information about these components, see the section, "Identify UDI Deployment Process Components", in the MDT document *Using the Microsoft Deployment Toolkit*, which is included with MDT.

### UDI Wizard

The UDI Wizard provides the UI for collecting deployment settings that the UDI task sequences consume. The UDI Wizard is initiated as a part of a UDI task sequence and collects the necessary configuration information for customizing the deployment of the Windows client operating systems and applications. The wizard pages read their configuration settings from the UDI Wizard configuration file, which is customized using the UDI Wizard Designer.

 The UDI Wizard is initiated by the **UDI Wizard** task sequence step in task sequences created using the UDI task sequence templates. The **UDI Wizard** task sequence step runs the UDIWizard.wsf script, which in turn initiates the UDI Wizard (OSDSetupWizard.exe). Table 9 lists the UDI Wizard command-line parameters and provides a brief description of each.

## Table 9. UDI Wizard Command-Line Parameters

|**Parameter**|**Description**|
|-|-|
|**/preview**|Allows you to preview the current configuration of the wizard by enabling the **Next** button, which allows you to move from page to page without requiring valid input.|
|**/xml**|Specifies the name of the UDI Wizard configuration file. The UDIWizard.wsf script automatically sets this parameter to the OSDSetupWizard.xml file, which is stored in the folder in which the task sequence stores log files. This parameter defaults to the config.xml file.<br><br> The syntax for this parameter is as follows (where `<full_path>` is the fully qualified path to the .xml file, including the file name and extension):<br><br> `/xml:<full_path>`|
|**/stage**|Specifies the name of the UDI stage to run. The UDIWizard.wsf script automatically sets this parameter to the appropriate stage, as described in [UDI Stage Reference](#udi-stage-reference). This parameter defaults to the first stage in the UDI Wizard configuration file.<br><br> The syntax for this parameter is as follows (where `<stage_name>` is the name of the stage to be run):<br><br> `/stage:<stage_name>`<br><br> Note:<br><br> The value for <stage_name> is case sensitive.|
|**/locale**|Specifies the language to use in the UDI Wizard in the form of a locale identifier (LCID), which is represented by a numeric value. For a list of the available LCIDs, see [Locale IDs Assigned by Microsoft](/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-lcid/a9eac961-e77d-41a6-90a5-ce1a8b0cdb9c).<br><br> You would use this list to identify the language you want to use, and then provide the corresponding LCID.<br><br> The syntax for this parameter is as follows (where `<locale_id>` is the numeric value of the LCID to be used):<br><br> `/locale:<locale_id>`|

### UDI Wizard Application Configuration File

The **ApplicationPage** wizard page configures the UDI Wizard application configuration file, which maintains the list of software to be installed. This file contains an entry for each Configuration Manager application or program and package that was added using the UDI Wizard Designer.

 This file has the same name as the UDI Wizard configuration file but with a .app extension. For example, if the UDI Wizard configuration file is named *Config.xml,* then the corresponding UDI Wizard application configuration file would be *Config.xml.app.* This file is the companion to the UDI Wizard configuration file.

### UDI Wizard Configuration File

The UDI Wizard reads the UDI Wizard configuration file to determine the wizard pages to be displayed, the sequence of the wizard pages, any default for controls on the wizard pages, and whether the controls are enabled or disabled. This file contains all the configuration settings that are displayed in the UDI Wizard and are configured using the UDI Wizard Designer.

 A separate configuration file—the UDI Wizard application configuration file—is used to configure applications to be installed on the target computer.

### UDI Wizard Designer

The UDI Wizard Designer is the primary tool for customizing wizard pages for the different deployment scenarios that UDI supports. Changes made in the UDI Wizard Designer are saved in the UDI Wizard configuration file and ultimately reflected in the user experience in the UDI Wizard. The user performing the deployment will see only the wizard pages in the UDI Wizard that you have selected and configured using the UDI Wizard Designer.

 Although the UDI Wizard would run with the default UDI Wizard configuration file, the wizard pages would not be configured correctly. It is recommended that you use the UDI Wizard Designer to configure the UDI Wizard user experience.

> [!NOTE]
>
> To run the UDI Wizard Designer, you must have the appropriate rights in Configuration Manager to access objects such as packages, applications, or images.

### Validator

You use UDI validators to help ensure that the correct information is entered into text fields on wizard pages in the UDI Wizard. UDI includes several built-in validators that help you perform typical validations of fields used for entering text, such as preventing users from entering invalid characters and ensuring that the field is not empty. When a validator detects an invalid entry in a text box, a message is displayed on the wizard page, and the **Next** button is disabled until all invalid entries are resolved.

 UDI includes built-in validators that allow you to perform most of the validation necessary for deployment. For more information about the UDI built-in validators, see [Built-in UDI Validators](#built-in-udi-validators).

 If your requirements go beyond the built-in UDI validators, you can write custom UDI validators. *UDI validators* are DLLs written in C++ that implement the **IValidator** interface. Register the DLL with the UDI Wizard Designer validator library by creating a UDI Wizard Designer configuration (.config) file and placing it in the *installation_folder*\Bin\Config folder (where *installation_folder* is the folder in which you installed MDT). For more information on developing custom UDI tasks, see the section, "Creating Custom UDI Validators", in the MDT document *User-Driven Installation Developers Guide*.

### Wizard Page

You use a wizard page to collect configuration information in the UDI Wizard. Configure UDI wizard pages using the UDI Wizard Designer. The configuration settings are stored in the UDI Wizard configuration file and are read by the wizard page when the page is initialized in the UDI Wizard.

 Wizard pages are stored in the wizard Page Library, and they can be used in one or more UDI stages. This design allows you to configure a wizard page that is shared between stages once for all stages, dramatically reducing the amount of effort required and the complexity of updating wizard page configuration.

 UDI includes built-in wizard pages and wizard page editors that are typically sufficient for most deployments. For more information about the built-in wizard pages, see [Built-in UDI Wizard Pages](#built-in-udi-wizard-pages).

 If your requirements go beyond the built-in UDI wizard pages and corresponding wizard page editors, you can write custom UDI wizard pages and wizard page editors. UDI wizard pages are implemented as DLLs that the UDI Wizard reads. Wizard page editors are created using C++ in Visual Studio.

 For more information on developing custom UDI wizard pages, see the section, "Creating Custom UDI Wizard Pages", in the MDT document *User-Driven Installation Developers Guide*.

### Wizard Page Editor

You use a wizard page editor to configure a wizard page in the UDI Wizard Designer. A wizard page editor updates the wizard page configuration settings in the UDI Wizard configuration file; UDI includes a built-in wizard page editor for each built-in wizard page. For more information about the built-in wizard pages and wizard page editors, see [Built-in UDI Wizard Pages](#built-in-udi-wizard-pages).

 If your requirements go beyond the built-in UDI wizard pages and corresponding wizard page editors, you can write custom UDI wizard pages and wizard page editors. UDI wizard page editors are implemented as DLLs that the UDI Wizard Designer reads. Create wizard page editors using:

- [Windows Presentation Foundation](/dotnet/desktop-wpf/) version 4.0

- [Microsoft Prism](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/165370/Creating-View-Switching-Applications-with-Prism-4) version 4.0

- [Microsoft Unity Application Block](https://www.codeproject.com/articles/42524/a-basic-introduction-to-the-unity-application-bloc) (Unity) version 2.1

  For more information on developing custom UDI wizard page editors, see the section, "Creating Custom Wizard Page Editors", in the MDT document *User-Driven Installation Developers Guide*.

## OSDResults Reference

**OSDResults** is a part of UDI that displays the results of a deployment performed using UDI. **OSDResults** displays the **Deployment Complete** dialog box. **OSDResults** is displayed prior to Windows logon the first time the target computer is started. The user can use **OSDResults** and the information in the **Deployment Complete** dialog box to determine the completion status of the deployment process and the configuration of the computer prior to logging on for the first time. In addition, the information in **OSDResults** can be used for troubleshooting any problems encountered during the deployment process.

 You can configure some of the user interface elements for **OSDResults** using the OSDResults.exe.config file, which resides in Tools\OSDResults in the MDT files Configuration Manager package. Table 10 lists the configuration settings in the OSDResults.exe.config file.

## Table 10. Configuration Settings in the OSDResults.exe.config File

|**Setting**|**Description**|
|-|-|
|**headerImagePath**|This setting allows you to specify the fully qualified or relative path to a .bmp file that is displayed in the header of the **OSDResults** dialog box.<br><br> The default value for this setting is as follows:<br><br> `images\UDI_Wizard_Banner.bmp`|
|**backgroundWallpaper**|This setting allows you to specify the fully qualified or relative path to a .jpg file that is displayed as the wallpaper in the **OSDResults** dialog box.<br><br> The default value for this setting is as follows:<br><br> `images\Wallpaper.jpg`|
|**welcomeText**|This setting allows you to specify the text that welcomes the user and provides information about the deployment process. It is displayed in the **OSDResults** dialog box.|
|**completedText**|This setting allows you to specify the text that indicates whether the deployment process is complete. It is displayed in the **OSDResults** dialog box.|
|**timeoutMinutes**|This setting allows you to specify the length of time the **OSDResults** dialog box is displayed prior to automatically displaying the Windows logon screen. The value for this setting is specified in minutes.<br><br> The default value for this setting is zero (0), which indicates that the **OSDResults** dialog box will be displayed indefinitely until manually closed.|

 The following is the high-level process for how the **OSDResults** feature works in UDI:

1. A task sequence runs on the target computer.

    The task sequence is based on one of the followUDI task sequence templates:

   - **User Driven Installation Task Sequence**. This task sequence template is used for the MDT New Computer, Refresh Computer, and Replace Computer MDT deployment scenarios.

   - **User-Driven Installation Replace Task Sequence**. This task sequence template is the first step in a two-step process in the MDT Replace Computer deployment scenario and is used to capture user state migration data. The second step in the two step process is the MDT New Computer deployment scenario using the **User Driven Installation Task Sequence** task sequence template, which is used to deploy the target applications and operating system and restore the user state migration data saved during the first step of the process

     For more information about the:

   - UDI task sequence templates, see the section, "Identify the UDI Task Sequence Templates in MDT", in the MDT document *Using the Microsoft Deployment Toolkit*

   - Relationship between MDT deployment scenarios and UDI stages, see [UDI Stage Reference](#udi-stage-reference)

2. During the task sequence, the configuration settings provided by task sequence variables and from user input in the UDI Wizard are saved in the *%DEPLOYROOT%*\Tools\OSDResults folder on the target computer (where *%DEPLOYROOT%* is the root of the folder in which the MDT files are locally cached on the target computer).

3. In the **OSD Results and Branding** group in the task sequence, the following task sequence steps are run that affect **OSDResults**:

   -   **Cache OSD Results.** This task sequence step copies the contents of the *%DEPLOYROOT%*\Tools\OSDResults folder to the %WINDIR%\UDI folder on the target computer. This ensures that the contents of the OSDResults folder will be persisted after the task sequence finishes.

   -   **Run OSD Results.** This tasks sequence step configures the target computer to run **OSDResults** the first time the computer starts.

4. The target computer starts for the first time, and OSDResults.exe is run prior to the Windows logon screen.

    The **Welcome** tab in the **Deployment Complete** dialog box is displayed. The **Welcome** tab provides helpful information about the deployment and contact information in the event that issues with the deployment are discovered.

    Review the information on the **Deployment Summary** and **Applications Installed** tabs to verify that the operating system and applications were installed correctly. When you have completed reviewing these tables, select **Start Windows** to log on to Windows 7 for the first time.

   > [!NOTE]
   >  Configuration Manager applications are not displayed on the **Applications Installed** tab. The Configuration Manager applications are detected after the user logs on to the target computer the first time.

5. The Windows logon screen is displayed, and the logon process continues normally.

    AppInstall.exe is run the first time a user logs on to the target computer. For more information on this process, see [User-Centric App Installer Reference](#user-centric-app-installer-reference).

## User-Centric App Installer Reference

The User-Centric App Installer feature in UDI is used to report any applications installed during the UDI deployment process to the Application Catalog feature in Configuration Manager. The User-Centric App Installer feature provides the link between the applications selected on the **ApplicatonPage** wizard page in the UDI Wizard and any optional Configuration Manager applications advertised to the users.

 For more information on the Application Catalog feature in Configuration Manager, see [Application Management in Configuration Manager](/previous-versions/system-center/system-center-2012-R2/gg699373(v=technet.10)).

 The following is the high-level process for how the App Install feature works in UDI:

1. Configuration Manager applications are created in Configuration Manager.

    For more information about creating and managing Configuration Manager applications, see the following resources:

   -   [How to Create Applications in Configuration Manager](/previous-versions/system-center/system-center-2012-R2/gg682159(v=technet.10))

   -   [Operations and Maintenance for Application Management in Configuration Manager](/previous-versions/system-center/system-center-2012-R2/gg681963(v=technet.10))

2. The Configuration Manager user collections are created, and users are added to the collection.

    For more information about creating and managing user collections and adding users to collections, see the following resources:

   -   [Collections in Configuration Manager](/previous-versions/system-center/system-center-2012-R2/gg682169(v=technet.10))

   -   [How to Create Collections in Configuration Manager](/previous-versions/system-center/system-center-2012-R2/gg712295(v=technet.10))

3. The Configuration Manager applications are deployed to the user collections.

    For more information about how to deploy the applications to user collections, see [How to Deploy Applications in Configuration Manager](/previous-versions/system-center/system-center-2012-R2/gg682082(v=technet.10)).

4. The Configuration Manager applications are made available on the **ApplicatonPage** wizard page using the UDI Wizard Designer.

    For more information about how to make Configuration Manager applications available on the **ApplicatonPage** wizard page, see the section, "Step 5-11: Customize the UDI Wizard Configuration File for the Target Computer", in the MDT document *Quick Start Guide for User-Driven Installation*.

5. UDA is configured using one of the following methods:

   - In the Configuration Manger console (For more information about configuring UDA in the Configuration Manager console, see [How to Manage User Device Affinity in Configuration Manager](/previous-versions/system-center/system-center-2012-R2/gg699365(v=technet.10)).)

   - On the **UDAPage** wizard page in the UDI Wizard. For more information about the **UDAPage** wizard page, see [UDAPage](#udapage).

     After UDA is configured, the specified user account will be the primary user for the target computer.

   > [!NOTE]
   >  UDA can only be configured by UDI in the New Computer deployment scenario. It cannot be configured in the Refresh Computer or Replace Computer deployment scenarios.

6. The task sequence is run, and the user selects the Configuration Manager applications on the **ApplicatonPage** wizard page in the UDI Wizard.

    The UDI Wizard is run in the **UDI Wizard** task sequence step in the **Preinstall** group of the task sequence. When the user selects Configuration Manager applications on the **ApplicatonPage** wizard page, the wizard page creates a separate task sequence variable for each application selected.

    For more information on selecting the Configuration Manager applications on the **ApplicatonPage** wizard page in the UDI Wizard, see the section, "Step 6-4: Start the Target Computer with the Task Sequence Bootable Media", in the MDT document *Quick Start Guide for User-Driven Installation*.

7. The task sequence installs the Configuration Manager applications that were selected in the previous step.

    The Configuration Manager applications are installed using the following task sequence steps in the **Install Applications** group in the task sequence:

   -   **Convert list to two digits**

   -   **Install Application**

8. The task sequence performs the following tasks in the **OSD Results and Branding** group prior to starting the target operating system for the first time:

   -   Copies the information used for OSDResults.exe to the %WINDIR%\UDI folder on the target computer in the **Cache OSD Results** task sequence step

   -   Records the task sequence variables created in step 6 for the Configuration Manager applications in the registry on the target computer in the **Branding to Reg** and **Branding to Reg x64** task sequence steps

        The tasks sequence variables are saved in the following location in the registry:

        **HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\MPSD\OSD**

   -   Configures the target operating system to automatically run OSDResults.exe when the computer starts prior to the Windows logon screen in the **Run OSD Results** task sequence step

   -   Configures the target operating system to automatically run AppInstall.exe when a user logs on to the computer for the first time in the **Run OSD Results** task sequence step

   -   Configures a task on the target operating system to remove the %WINDIR%\UDI folder one month from the date of the deployment

9. The target computer is started, and OSDResults.exe is run.

     For more information about OSDResults.exe, see [OSDResults Reference](#osdresults-reference).

10. A user logs on to the target computer, and AppInstall.exe starts automatically.

11. AppInstall checks whether the currently logged-on user is a primary user who was configured in UDA.

     A *primary user* is a user who uses the device on a regular basis and is considered the owner, or one of the owners, of the device.

     If the currently logged-on user is:

    - Not a primary user, then AppInstall.exe stops

    - A primary user, then AppInstall.exe reads the registry entries saved in step 8 to determine which applications were installed

12. AppIntaller connects to Configuration Manager and reads the Application Catalog using the following steps:

    1. AppInstall will wait 5 minutes after it starts to allow the Configuration Manager policies to be available.

    2. After 5 minutes, AppInstall attempts to connect to the Application Catalog.

    3. If AppInstall is unable to connect, then it will wait for a period of time before attempting to connect again.

    4. AppInstall attempts to connect up to five times before exiting.

       You can configure the connection time-out delay and the number of retries for AppInstall using the AppInstall.exe.config file, which resides in the Tools\OSDResults folder in the MDT files Configuration Manager package. Table 11 lists the configuration settings in the AppInstall.exe.config file.

## Table 11. Configuration Settings in the AppInstall.exe.config File

|**Setting**|**Description**|
|-|-|
|**timeoutMinutes**|This setting allows you to specify the length of time for AppInstall to wait for a response from the Configuration Manager Application Catalog before timing out. The value is specified in minutes. The default value for this setting is **5**.|
|**delayTimer**|This setting allows you to specify the length of time for AppInstall to wait prior to attempting the connection to the Configuration Manager Application Catalog. The value is specified in minutes. The default value for this setting is **5**.|

1. AppInstall compares the list of applications discovered in the registry with the list of applications available from the Configuration Manger Application Catalog for the user currently logged on.

     If the application discovered in the registry:

    - Is available in the Application Catalog, then AppInstall.exe maps the applications and identifies the applications as existing both in the registry and in the Application Catalog. These applications will be used in the following step.

    - Is not available in the Application Catalog, then AppInstall.exe does not create a mapping. These applications will not be used in the following step.

2. AppInstall uses Configuration Manager APIs to initiate the installation of the mapped applications.

     The applications used in this step were mapped in the previous step. That is to say, they were both listed in the registry and found in the Application Catalog.

3. As a part of the installation process, Configuration Manager detects whether the application is already installed.

     Because the application has already been installed, Configuration Manager records that the application has been successfully deployed to that user, and the application will be listed in Software Center for that user. Configuration Manager begins management and monitoring of the application for that user.

4. After 1 month, the task created on the target computer in step 8 runs and removes the %WINDIR%\UDI folder.

     The folder is retained for 1 month so that the primary users have an opportunity to be log on and run AppInstall.exe.

## UDI Stage Reference

The MDT deployment scenarios use one or more UDI [stage](#stage). Each UDI stage used in the MDT deployment scenarios is discussed in a subsequent section in the context of the MDT deployment scenario. In some MDT deployment scenarios, only one stage is used. In other MDT deployment scenarios, multiple stages are used within the scenario. For more information on the MDT deployment scenarios, see the section, "Identifying Deployment Scenarios", in the MDT document *Using the Microsoft Deployment Toolkit.*

 Table 12 lists the MDT deployment scenarios and provides a brief description of each, how each scenario is selected, and which UDI stages are used in each deployment scenario. MDT automatically determines which MDT deployment scenario to use based on the MDT task sequence template you use to create your task sequence and on how the task sequence is initiated.

 Each UDI stage used in the MDT deployment scenarios is discussed in a subsequent section in the context of the MDT deployment scenario. In some MDT deployment scenarios, only one stage is used. In other MDT deployment scenarios, multiple stages are used within the scenario. For more information on the MDT deployment scenarios, see the section, "Identifying Deployment Scenarios", in the MDT document *Using the Microsoft Deployment Toolkit.*

## Table 12. MDT Deployment Scenarios and UDI Stages

|**Scenario**|**Description**|
|-|-|
|New Computer|MDT for UDI automatically selects this scenario when you:<br><br> - Create the advertised task sequence using the User-Driven Installation Task Sequence task sequence template<br><br> - Start the task sequence in Windows PE using PXE boot, task sequence boot media, or prestaged media for the NEWCOMPUTER.Prestaged stage<br><br> This scenario can be used with traditional deployments or with prestaged media deployments as supported in Configuration Manager. Run the UDI Wizard with the following UDI stages to support each type of deployment:<br><br> - **NEWCOMPUTER stage.** The UDI Wizard is run with this stage in the **User-Driven Installation Task Sequence** task sequence when the operating system image is stored on distribution points. For more information, see [NEWCOMPUTER Stage](#newcomputer-stage).<br><br> -                         **NEWCOMPUTER.Prestage stage.** The UDI Wizard is run with this stage in the **User-Driven Installation Task Sequence** task sequence when the operating system image is stored on a local disk on the target computer (prestaged). For more information, see [NEWCOMPUTER.Prestaged Stage](#newcomputerprestaged-stage).|
|Refresh Computer|MDT for UDI automatically selects this scenario when you:<br><br> - Create the advertised task sequence using the User-Driven Installation Task Sequence task sequence template<br><br> - Start the task sequence in the existing Windows operating system on the target computer (not in Windows PE)<br><br> - The UDI Wizard is run with the REFRESH stage to support this deployment scenario.

|Replace Computer|This scenario includes an existing computer and a replacement computer. A separate task sequence is created and run on each computer as described in the following process:<br><br> -                          **On the existing computer.** MDT for UDI automatically selects this portion of the scenario when you:<br><br> - Create the advertised task sequence using the User-Driven Installation Replace Task Sequence task sequence template<br><br> Start the task sequence in the existing Windows operating system on the target computer (not in Windows PE)<br><br> The UDI Wizard is run with the following UDI stages to support this deployment scenario:<br><br> - **REPLACE stage.** This stage is run in the existing Windows operating system and captures configuration information from within Windows.<br><br> -                          **REPLACE.WinPE stage.** This stage is run in Windows PE and completes the capturing of configuration information from the existing computer—for example, running USMT and capturing the user state migration data.<br><br> The user state is captured to a network shared folder or to a local USB drive.<br><br> For more information on the REPLACE and REPLACE.WinPE stages, see [REPLACE and REPLACE.WinPE Stages](#replace-and-replacewinpe-stages).<br><br> -                          **On the replacement computer.** This portion of the scenario is identical to the New Computer scenario, except that the user state captured in the previous step is restored. MDT for UDI automatically selects this portion of the scenario when you:<br><br> - Create the advertised task sequence using the User-Driven Installation Task Sequence task sequence template<br><br> - Start the task sequence in Windows PE using PXE boot, task sequence boot media, or prestaged media for the NEWCOMPUTER.Prestaged stage.<br><br> This portion of the scenario can be used with traditional deployments or with prestaged media deployments as supported in Configuration Manager. As a part of this portion of the scenario, the user state migration data is restored. The UDI Wizard is run with the following UDI stages to support each type of deployment:<br><br> -                          **NEWCOMPUTER stage.** The UDI Wizard is run with this stage in the **User-Driven Installation Task Sequence** task sequence when the operating system image is stored on distribution points. For more information, see [NEWCOMPUTER Stage](#newcomputer-stage).<br><br> -                          **NEWCOMPUTER.Prestage stage.** The UDI Wizard is run with this stage in the **User-Driven Installation Task Sequence** task sequence when the operating system image is stored on a local disk on the target computer (prestaged). For more information, see [NEWCOMPUTER.Prestaged Stage](#newcomputerprestaged-stage).|

#### NEWCOMPUTER Stage

Figure 1 illustrates the use of the NEWCOMPUTER stage in a task sequence created using the User\-Driven Installation Task Sequence task sequence template. The primary difference between the task sequences calling the NEWCOMPUTER stage and the NEWCOMPUTER.Prestaged stage is that the task sequence calling the NEWCOMPUTER.Prestaged stage does not run the **Apply Operating System Image** task sequence step, because the operating system image is already located on the target computer.

## UDI Task Reference

*UDI tasks* are software that is run on a wizard page that perform specific functions. In some instances, these tasks are used to verify that the target computer is ready for deployment. Other tasks can be used to perform deployment steps, such as copying configuration or result files.

> [!NOTE]
>
> The **Next** button on the wizard page where the tasks are run will be disabled if any of the tasks finish with warning or error completion status.

 This reference includes:

- An overview of UDI tasks, as described in [UDI Task Overview](#udi-task-overview)

- A description of the configuration settings for UDI tasks, as described in [UDI Task Configuration Settings](#udi-task-configuration-settings)

- A description of the built\-in UDI validators that are provided with MDT, as described in [Built\-in UDI Tasks](#built-in-udi-tasks)

### UDI Task Overview

UDI tasks allow you to run software on the target computer that helps with the deployment process. UDI includes several built\-in tasks that help you perform common tasks, such as ensuring that the target computer is not running on a battery and is connected to a wired network connection.

 In addition to the built\-in UDI tasks, you can create custom UDI tasks using the UDI software development kit \(SDK\). For more information about creating custom UDI tasks using the UDI SDK, see *User\-Driven Installation Developers Guide*.

### UDI Task Configuration Settings

You manage tasks using the UDI Wizard Designer. You can add tasks, remove tasks, and edit the configuration of a task in the UDI Wizard Designer. The configuration settings for a task are stored in the UDI Wizard configuration file and are read by the UDI Wizard when the wizard page that contains the task is displayed.

 UTI tasks have some configuration settings that are common to all UDI tasks, as listed in Table 13. For the configuration settings that are specific to each UDI task, see the corresponding section in [Built\-in UDI Tasks](#built-in-udi-tasks).

## Table 13. Configuration Settings Common to All UDI Tasks

|**Task**|**Description**|
|-|-|
|**Bitmap Filename**|This parameter specifies the graphic used to indicate the task type.|
|**Display Name**|This specifies the name of the task, which is displayed on the wizard page when the task is run.|
|**Exit Code Values**|This specifies a list of possible return codes for the task. An item exists in the list for each possible return code.|
|**Error Code Values**|This specifies a list of possible unexpected exceptions that may be encountered \(thrown\) by the task. An item exists in the list for each possible exception.|

|          Exit          | **33554432** |    **Warning**, which indicates that critical problems were encountered while processing the application master list     |

#### CheckSMSFolderOnUSB

Use this UDI task to identify whether the \_SMSTaskSequence folder is located on a USB drive on the target computer. By default, the Configuration Manager task sequencer places the \_SMSTaskSequence folder on the drive with the most available free disk space. This can cause problems later in the deployment process if the USB drive is removed.

 This task checks to see whether the folder is located on a USB drive and prevents the deployment from proceeding if it is. This task uses only those parameters common to all UDI tasks. For more information about these parameters, see [UDI Task Configuration Settings](#udi-task-configuration-settings).

 If the \_SMSTaskSequence folder is located on a USB drive, this task fails and prevents the deployment from continuing. To resolve this issue and perform the deployment, complete the following steps:

1. Disconnect the USB drive from the target computer before starting the task sequence.

2. Start the task sequence.

3. Wait until the UDI Wizard starts.

4. Connect the USB drive.

5. Complete the UDI Wizard.

   Table 18 lists the error and exit codes that the **CheckSMSFolderOnUSB** task generates.

## Table 18. Error and Exit Codes for the CheckSMSFolderOnUSB Task

| **Exit or error code** | **Value** |                                                          **Status**                                                           |
|------------------------|-----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|          Exit          |   **0**   | **Success**, which indicates that the \_SMSTaskSequence folder is not located on a USB drive and the deployment can continue. |
|          Exit          |  **\\***  |  **Error**, which indicates that the \_SMSTaskSequence folder is located on a USB drive and the deployment cannot continue.   |

#### Copy Files Task

|          Exit          |  **\\***  |  **Error**, which indicates that the copy process failed   |
|         Error          |  **\-1**  |  **Error**, which indicates that the copy process failed   |

#### Shell Execute Task

Use this UDI task to run software that can be initiated from a command line.

 Table 21 lists the parameters that the **Shell Execute** task uses.

## Table 21. Parameters Used by the Shell Execute Task

|**Task**|**Description**|
|-|-|
|**Filename**|This parameter specifies the fully qualified or relative path to the command for the task to run.|
|**Parameters**|This parameter specifies the command\-line parameters that are to be provided when running the command.|

 In addition to the parameters in Table 21, this task uses parameters common to all UDI tasks. For more information about these parameters, see [UDI Task Configuration Settings](#udi-task-configuration-settings).

 You can also run custom Visual Basic scripts designed to run in cscript.exe using the **Shell Execute** task. To run Visual Basic scripts, perform the following steps:

1. Type the following text in the **Filename** parameter:

   ```cmd
   %windir%\system32\cscript.exe
   ```

2. Type name of the Visual Basic script file \(.vbs file\) in the **Parameters** parameter, including any command\-line parameters for the script.

    For example, to run a Visual Basic script named *SelfTest.vbs* with a parameter value of **Debug**, type the following \(where *script\_path* is the fully qualified path to the SelfTest.vbs file\):

   ```cmd
   <script_path>\SelfTest.vbs Debug
   ```

   Table 22 lists the common error and exit codes that the **Shell Execute** task generates.

## UDI Validator Reference

UDI validators are used to validate values entered in text fields on wizard pages. When a UDI validator detects an invalid entry, a message is displayed for the first error encountered at the bottom of the wizard page. The next validation error message, if any, is displayed after you resolve the first validation error. This process continues until all validation errors are resolved. The **Next** button is disabled until all validation errors on the wizard page are resolved.

 This reference includes:

- An overview of UDI validators, as described in [UDI Validator Overview](#udi-validator-overview)

- A description of the built\-in UDI validators provided with MDT, as described in [Built\-in UDI Validators](#built-in-udi-validators)

### UDI Validator Overview

UDI validators are used to help ensure that users provide the correct information in the text fields on wizard pages in the UDI Wizard. UDI includes several built\-in validators that help you perform typical validations of fields used for entering text, such as preventing users from entering invalid characters or ensuring that the field is not empty.

 In addition to the built\-in UDI validators, you can create custom UDI validators using the UDI SDK. For more information about creating custom UDI validators using the UDI SDK, see the MDT document *User\-Driven Installation Developers Guide*.

### Built-in UDI Validators

Table 24 lists the built-in UDI validators. Each built-in validator is discussed in a subsequent section. When a validator detects an invalid entry in a text box, a message is displayed on the wizard page, and the **Next** button is disabled until all invalid entries are resolved.

## Table 24. Built-in UDI Validators

|**Validator**|**Description**|
|-|-|
|[InvalidChars](#invalidchars)|This validator identifies any invalid characters that have been entered from a list that you configure.|
|[NamedPattern](#namedpattern)|This validator helps ensure that the text follows a predefined pattern.|
|[NonEmpty](#nonempty)|This validator is used to require text in a field.|
|[RegEx](#regex)|This validator allows you ensure that the text matches a regular expression that you specify as a part of the validator.|

#### InvalidChars

This validator prevents users from entering specific characters. The **Message** box allows you to enter a message that is displayed if the text field contains any of the invalid characters. The **Invalid Characters** box allows you to enter the characters that are considered invalid. The characters are entered without spaces between them.

#### NamedPattern

This validator helps ensure that the text follows a predefined pattern. The **Message** box allows you to enter a message that is displayed if the text field does not match the named pattern. The **Named Pattern** box allows you to enter the name of the predefined pattern and must be **Username**, **ComputerName**, or **Workgroup**.  The names are case insensitive.

#### NonEmpty

Use this validator to require text in a field. The **Message** box allows you to enter a message that is displayed if the text field is empty.

#### RegEx

This validator allows you ensure that the text matches a regular expression that you specify as a part of the validator. The **Message** box allows you to enter a message that is displayed if the text field does not match the regular expression. The **Regular Expression** box allows you to enter the regular expression used for the validation. For more information about how to build regular expressions for this validator, see [TR1 Regular Expressions](/cpp/standard-library/regular-expressions-cpp).

## UDI Wizard Page Reference

You add a UDI [wizard page](#wizard-page) to stages from the [Page Library](#page-library) in the [UDI Wizard Designer](#udi-wizard-designer). UDI wizard pages are displayed in the [UDI Wizard](#udi-wizard).

 This reference includes:

- An overview of UDI wizard pages, as described in [UDI Wizard Page Overview](#udi-wizard-page-overview)

- A description of the built-in UDI wizard pages that are provided with MDT, as described in [Built-in UDI Wizard Pages](#built-in-udi-wizard-pages)

### UDI Wizard Page Overview

Wizard pages are displayed in the [UDI Wizard](#udi-wizard) and collect the information required to complete the deployment process. You create wizard pages using C++ in Visual Studio. The custom wizard pages are implemented as DLLs that the UDI Wizard reads.

 Each built-in UDI wizard page has a corresponding UDI [wizard page editor](#wizard-page-editor), which you use to configure the wizard page in the [UDI Wizard Designer](#udi-wizard-designer).

 In addition to the built-in UDI wizard pages, you can create custom UDI wizard pages using the UDI SDK. For more information about creating custom UDI wizard pages using the UDI SDK, see the MDT document *User-Driven Installation Developers Guide*.

 Each wizard page can reference the following types of variables:

- Task sequence variables

- Memory variables

- Environment variables

  You can reference task sequence and environment variables by bracketing the variable using percent signs (%), such as *%OSDImageIndex%.* You can reference memory variables by bracketing the variable using dollar signs ($), such as *$VolumeArchitecture$.*

> [!NOTE]
>
> If a task sequence variable and an environment variable both have the same name, then the task sequence variable takes precedence over the environment variable.

 Table 25 lists the memory variables that are set when the UDI Wizard starts, the description of the variables, and whether the UDI Wizard reads or writes the variables during startup.

## Table 25. Memory Variables Set by the UDI Wizard at Startup and Their Descriptions

|**Variable**|**Read**|**Write**|
|-|-|-|
|**LogPath**<br><br> Specifies the fully qualified path to the log files for the UDI Wizard. You can set this variable to one of the following values:<br><br> - The value in the **_SMSTSLogPath** task sequence variable<br><br> - The value of the %TEMP% environment variable if the **_SMSTSLogPath** task sequence variable is not set|No|Yes|
|**WizardConfigFilename**<br><br> Specifies the name of the UDI Wizard configuration file currently in use. The **ApplicationPage** wizard page reads the value of this variable to find the corresponding .app file, which contains the list of applications. For example, if the UDI Wizard configuration file is named *config.xml,* then the wizard page will look for the corresponding .app file (config.xml.app).|No|Yes|

### Built-in UDI Wizard Pages

Table 26 lists the built-in UDI wizard pages. Each built-in UDI wizard page is discussed in a subsequent section.

|**OSDArchitecture**<br><br> Specifies the processor architecture of the target computer. The **ApplicationPage** wizard page uses this variable to filter the available applications when the **VolumeArchitecture** memory variable has not been set. However, if the **VolumeArchitecture** memory variable has been set, it always takes precedence over this task sequence variable for filtering the available applications.<br><br> The value for this variable can be:<br><br> -                                      **x86**, which indicates a 32-bit processor architecture<br><br> -                                      **amd64**, which indicates a 64-bit processor architecture|Yes|No|No|
|**OSDBaseVariableName**<br><br> Specifies the name used as the base for the task sequence variable names created for each Configuration Manager package and program selected on the **ApplicationPage** wizard page. This variable is configured using the **Edit Software Settings** button in the **Page Behavior** group on the Ribbon in the UDI Wizard Designer.<br><br> A separate task sequence variable is created for each application selected on this page. The default value for this variable is **PACKAGES**. So, for example, the default names of the task sequence variables created for each application selected on this page will be *PACKAGES001, PACKAGES002, PACKAGES003,* and so forth.|No|Yes|Yes|

#### Memory Variables

Table 29 lists the **ApplicationPage** memory variables with the description and whether the variable is read or written by the wizard page.

## Table 29. ApplicationPage Memory Variables

|**Variable**|**Read**|**Write**|
|-|-|-|
|**VolumeArchitecture**<br><br> Specifies the processor architecture of the target operating system image to be deployed (whether the image contains a 32-bit or 64-bit operating system). When this page is displayed, it checks to see if this variable has changed. If the variable has changed since the last time the wizard page was displayed, the wizard page filters the programs available for selection based on architecture of the target operating system. For example, if a 32-bit operating system is to be deployed, then the wizard page removes (filters) any 64-bit applications from the list of available applications on the wizard page.|Yes|No|
|**WizardConfigFilename**<br><br> Specifies the name of the UDI Wizard configuration file currently in use. If the value of the **Link.Uri** setter property is empty, the **ApplicationPage** wizard page reads the value of this variable to find the corresponding .app file, which contains the list of applications. For example, if the UDI Wizard configuration file is named *config.xml,* then the wizard page will look for the corresponding .app file (config.xml.app). This variable is set when the UDI Wizard starts.<br><br> The **Link.Uri** setter property is set on the **Software Settings** dialog box, which can be opened using the **Edit Software Settings** button in the **Page Behavior** group on the Ribbon in the UDI Wizard Designer.|Yes|No|

#### BitLockerPage

This wizard page is used to configure BitLocker settings for the target computer.

|-|-|-|-|
|**KeyLocation**<br><br> Specifies the fully qualified path to the location where the BitLocker encryption keys are stored, which can be a local or UNC path. This configuration value is used to set the value of the **BDEKeyLocation** task sequence variable for the **BitLockerPage**. This variable is only considered valid when **OSDBitLockerMode** is set to **TPMKEY** or **KEY**.|Yes|No|Yes|

#### ComputerPage

Use this wizard page to configure the computer name of the target computer, the domain or workgroup to join, and the credentials to be used when joining a domain. When you configure this page to join the target computer to a domain, this wizard page will validate the credentials you provide for joining the domain in AD DS by default. Then, this wizard page attempts to modify a computer object in AD DS to verify that the user credentials provided on this page have permissions to create or modify the computer object. You can disable either of these behaviors. If you disable the validation of the credentials, then the verification of permissions for creating or modifying computer objects is also disabled. Both of these validations occur when the **Next** button is selected. If either of the validations encounters an error, an error message will be displayed and this page will continue to be displayed.

 The following is the order of precedence for determining the default computer name:

1. If the **UserExistingComputerName** value in the UDI Wizard configuration file is set to **TRUE**, then the existing computer name is used \(if present\).

2. If the **OSDComputerName** task sequence variable is set, then the computer name in that variable is used.

3. If a default value is specified for the computer name in the UDI Wizard configuration file, then that value is used.

##### Task Sequence Variables

Table 32 lists the **ComputerPage** task sequence variables with a description and whether the variable is read by the wizard page, written by the wizard page, or can be configured in the UDI Wizard configuration file.

- Copying the application discovery file to the location selected on the [UserStatePage](#userstatepage) wizard page

- Copying the printer configuration file to the location selected on the [UserStatePage](#userstatepage) wizard page

- Copying the list of installed products to the location selected on the [UserStatePage](#userstatepage) wizard page

- Running the USMT and saving the user state migration data to the location selected on the [UserStatePage](#userstatepage) wizard page

#### RebootPage

Use this wizard page to notify the user that the target computer is going to be restarted. You can configure the notification message using the UDI Wizard Designer.

#### SummaryPage

Use this wizard page to notify the user about the configuration options that were selected while running the UDI Wizard. The configuration information displayed on this wizard page is automatically collected from other wizard pages. Some fields on other wizard pages allow you to configure the caption \(label\) displayed on this wizard page using the UDI Wizard Designer.

#### UDAPage

Use this wizard page to configure the UDA between the target computer and a specified user. Assigning a user as the primary user of a computer allows automatic installation of software that is deployed to that user. The UDA feature is only available in Configuration Manager and only in the New Computer deployment scenario.

##### Task Sequence Variables

Table 35 lists the **UDAPage** task sequence variables with a description and whether the variable is read by the wizard page, written by the wizard page, or can be configured in the UDI Wizard configuration file.

## Table 35. UDAPage Task Sequence Variables

|**Variable**|**Read**|**Write**|**Config**|
|-|-|-|-|
|**SMSTSAssignUsersMode**<br><br> Specifies the mode for configuring user affinity in Configuration Manager. Use this variable to configure the behavior of creating affinity between the target computer and user accounts in the **SMSTSUdaUsers** task sequence variable. To set this variable, select the **Use User Device Affinity** check box.<br><br> If the variable is set to:<br><br> \-                                      **Auto**, then the affinity processing is automatically approved by Configuration Manager<br><br> \- **Pending**, then the affinity processing rules will require approval by a Configuration Manager administrator \(This is the value used when the **Use User Device Affinity** check box is selected.\)<br><br> \-                                      **Disabled**, then no affinity processing will occur|No|Yes|No|
|**SMSTSUdaUsers**<br><br> Specifies the users to be associated with the target computer. The **User Device Affinity Account** sets this variable. This variable can have one or many users specified and is in the format `Domain\User1, Domain\User2`.|Yes|Yes|Yes|

#### UserStatePage

Use this wizard page to configure the settings for capturing or restoring user state migration data. This wizard page is used for both user state migration data capture and restore.

 The **UserStatePage** can capture or restore user state migration data from a disk locally attached to the target computer, a USB drive attached to the target computer, or a network shared folder. In addition, you can select to not restore any user data. The code logic behind the wizard page enables, disables, or automatically selects each of the following options based on the deployment scenario and whether the disk is being formatted:

- **No Data to Restore.** This option indicates that there is no user state migration data to restore and sets the **OSDUserStateMode** task sequence variable and **UserStateMode** variable to **NoData**.

- **Local.** This option indicates that the user state migration data should be stored on a disk locally attached to the target computer and sets the **OSDUserStateMode** task sequence variable and **UserStateMode** variable to **Local**.

- **USB.** This option indicates that the user state migration data should be stored on a USB disk locally attached to the target computer and sets the **OSDUserStateMode** task sequence variable and **UserStateMode** variable to **USB**.

- **Network.** This option indicates that the user state migration data should be stored on a network shared folder and sets the **OSDUserStateMode** task sequence variable and **UserStateMode** variable to **Network**.

##### NEWCOMPUTER Stage Behavior

The NEWCOMPUTER stage is used for computers on which no user state migration data exists. The New Computer deployment scenario can be used as the second part of the Replace Computer deployment scenario. If the user selects to:

- Format the disk on the target computer, then the **UserStatePage** assumes that no user state migration data is located on the local hard disk, so the **Local** option is disabled and all other options are enabled

- Not format the disk on the target computer, then the **UserStatePage** assumes that there is user state migration data to be restored, and all options are disabled other than the **Local** option \(Using the **Local** option provides a faster method for restoring the user state migration data than the USB or network shared folder methods.\)

  Table 36 lists the behavior of the options on the wizard page for the NEWCOMPUTER stage. The **Format** column indicates whether the target hard disk is to be formatted as a part of the deployment. The other columns indicate the configuration of the options when the **UserStatePage** is loaded.

## Table 36. Behavior of Options for the NEWCOMPUTER Stage

|**Format**|**NoData**|**Local**|**USB**|**Network**|
|-|-|-|-|-|
|Yes|Enabled|Disabled|Enabled|Enabled|
|No|Disabled|Selected|Disabled|Disabled|

##### NewComputer.Prestaged Stage Behavior

The NEWCOMPUTER.Prestaged stage is based on the prestaged media feature in Configuration Manager. Because the local hard disk is new, there is no user state migration data to be restored from the local hard disk, so the **Local** option is disabled. All other options are valid for this deployment scenario and are enabled. No default option is selected.

 Table 37 lists the behavior of the options on the wizard page for the NewComputer.Prestaged stage. The **Format** column indicates whether the target hard disk is to be formatted as a part of the deployment. The other columns indicate the configuration of the options when the **UserStatePage** is loaded.

## Table 37. Behavior of Options for the NewComputer.Prestaged Stage

|**Format**|**NoData**|**Local**|**USB**|**Network**|
|-|-|-|-|-|
|N\/A|Enabled|Disabled|Enabled|Enabled|

##### REFRESH Stage Behavior

The REFRESH stage is initiated in a full Windows operating system, instead of Windows PE. If the user selects to:

- Format the disk on the target computer, then the **UserStatePage** assumes that no user state migration data is to be restored, and all options are disabled other than the **NoData** option

- Not format the disk on the target computer, then the **UserStatePage** assumes that there is user state migration data to be restored, and all options are disabled other than the **Local** option \(Using the **Local** option provides a faster method for restoring the user state migration data than the USB or network shared folder methods.\)

  Table 38 lists the behavior of the options on the wizard page for the REFRESH stage. The **Format** column indicates whether the target hard disk is to be formatted as a part of the deployment. The other columns indicate the configuration of the options when the **UserStatePage** is loaded.

## Table 38. Behavior of Options for the REFRESH Stage

|**Format**|**NoData**|**Local**|**USB**|**Network**|
|-|-|-|-|-|
|Yes|Selected|Disabled|Disabled|Disabled|
|No|Disabled|Selected|Disabled|Disabled|

##### REPLACE.WinPE Stage Behavior

The REPLACE.WinPE stage captures the user state migration data from the existing \(old\) computer, and then restores the user state migration data later using one of the New Computer deployment scenarios. Because two different computers are involved in the deployment, the user state migration data must be saved to a USB drive or to a network shared folder. Saving user state migration data to a local disk is unavailable.

 Table 39 lists the behavior of the options on the wizard page for the REPLACE.WinPE stage. The **Format** column indicates whether the target hard disk is to be formatted as a part of the deployment. The other columns indicate the configuration of the options when the **UserStatePage** is loaded.

## Table 39. Behavior of Options for the REPLACE.WinPE Stage

|**Format**|**NoData**|**Local**|**USB**|**Network**|
|-|-|-|-|-|
|N\/A|Disabled|Disabled|Enabled|Enabled|

If the variable is set to:<br><br> \-                                      **TRUE**, then the **Local**, **USB Target Drive**, or **Network** option was selected, and user state migration data will be captured or restored from the target computer<br><br> \- **FALSE**, then the **No Data to Restore** option was selected, and no user state migration data will be captured or restored from the target computer|No|Yes|No|
|**OSDUserStateKey**<br><br> Specifies the user name used to secure the user state migration data. The user name is provided when the user state migration data is captured. The same user name and password must be provided when the user state migration data is restored. You set the value of this variable in the **User name** box.|Yes|Yes|Yes|
|**OSDUserStateKeyPassword**<br><br> Specifies the password for the user name used to secure the user state migration data. Set the value of this variable in the **Password** and **Confirm password** boxes.|Yes|Yes|Yes|
|**OSDUserStateMode**<br><br> Specifies the mode \(method\) for capturing or restoring the user state migration data. The value of this variable is set by the options selected. If the variable is set to:<br><br> \- **NoData**, then the **No Data to Restore** option was selected, and no user state migration data will be captured or restored<br><br> \- **Local**, then the **Local** option was selected, and the user state migration data will be captured or restored from a local hard disk on the target computer<br><br> \- **Network**, then the **Network** option was selected, and the user state **migration** data will be captured to or restored from a network shared folder<br><br> \- When used in capture mode, this option creates a folder based on a hash of the user name and password so that the identity of the user state migration data is protected. The exact same user name and password must be used when restoring the user state migration data so that the wizard page can accurately locate the folder.<br><br> \- **USB**, then the **USB Target Drive** option was selected, and the user state migration data will be captured to or restored from a USB drive that is physically attached to the target computer<br><br> \- The wizard page behavior for USB drives is also affected by the **Format**, **FormatPrompt**, and **MinimumDriveSize** variables.|No|Yes|No|
|**SMSConnectNetworkFolderPath**<br><br> Specifies the network shared folder used for capturing and restoring user state migration data, which is selected from the **Network** box. The **Network** box displays a user\-friendly name for the network shared folder that is configured in the **Network Shares** box in the **Network Combo Box** section on the wizard page editor in the UDI Wizard Designer. If the variable is set prior to showing the wizard page, the value of the variable is used as the default value.|Yes|Yes|Yes|

##### Memory Variables

Use this wizard page to provide information to the user about the UDI Wizard and the deployment process. You can configure the notification message using the UDI Wizard Designer.

## UDI Build Your Own Page Toolbox Control Reference

The Build Your Own Page feature in UDI allows you to create custom wizard pages that you can use to collect additional deployment information for use in UDI. You can create custom wizard pages using the:

- **Build Your Own Page feature.** This feature allows you to create a custom wizard page for collecting deployment information without requiring you to write code or have developer skills. Use this feature if you need to collect basic information without advanced user interaction. For example, you cannot add any code or customize UI fonts using this feature.

- **UDI SDK and Visual Studio**. Use this SDK if you want to create an advanced, fully customized wizard page in Visual Studio for collecting deployment information. Although the UDI SDK allows you to create customized wizard pages, such as adding custom code or changing fonts, this method requires developer skills.

   For more information on using the UDI SDK to create custom wizard pages, see "Creating Custom UDI Wizard Pages" in the *User-Drive Installation Developers Guide*.

  The Build Your Own Page feature includes a toolbox of controls that you can add to your custom wizard page from the Build Your Own Page toolbox, which is displayed when you view the custom wizard page on the **Configure** tab in the UDI Wizard Designer.

  Table 45 lists the types of controls to your custom wizard page, which is illustrated in Figure 5. Each of these controls is discussed in further detail in a subordinate section.

## Table 45. Types of Controls in the UDI Build Your Own Page Toolbox

|**Control type**|**Description**|
|-|-|
|[Checkbox control](#checkbox-control)|This control allows you select or clear a configuration option and behaves as a traditional UI check box.|
|[Combobox control](#combobox-control)|This control allows you to select an item from a list of items and behaves as a traditional UI drop-down list.|
|[Line control](#line-control)|This control allows you to add a horizontal line to divide one portion of the custom wizard page from another.|
|[Label control](#label-control)|This control allows you to add descriptive, read-only text to the wizard page.|
|[Radio control](#radio-control)|This control allows you to select one configuration option from a group of two or more options.|
|[Bitmap control](#bitmap-control)|This control allows you to add a bitmap graphic (.bmp file) to the custom wizard page.|
|[Textbox control](#textbox-control)|This control allows you to enter text on the custom wizard page.|

 You can add any combination of these controls to your custom wizard page based on the information you want to collect. In addition, you can use the **Show Gridlines** check box to show or hide gridlines that can be used to assist in visually designing the custom wizard page.

 Figure 5 provides an example of a custom wizard page and the Build Your Own Page toolbox.
