# Toolkit Reference for the Microsoft Deployment Toolkit
 This reference is part of Microsoft&reg; Deployment Toolkit (MDT) 2013 and provides configuration settings that you can use in the deployment process. Review the MDT 2013 documents *Microsoft Deployment Toolkit Samples Guide* and *Using the Microsoft Deployment Toolkit* for help in customizing configuration settings for the deployment environment.  

> [!NOTE]
>  In this document, *Windows* applies to the Windows 8.1, Windows 8, Windows 7, Windows Server&reg; 2012 R2, Windows Server 2012, and Windows Server 2008 R2 operating systems unless otherwise noted. MDT does not support ARM processorâ€“based versions of Windows. Similarly, *MDT* refers to MDT 2013 unless otherwise stated.  

## Task Sequence Steps  
 *Task sequences* are created by the Task Sequence Editor and consist of a combined series of steps that are designed to complete an action. Task sequences can operate across a computer restart and can be configured to automate tasks on a computer without requiring user intervention. In addition, you can add task sequence steps to a task sequence group, which helps keep similar task sequence steps together for better organization and error control.  

 Each task sequence step performs a specific task, such as validating that the target computer is capable of receiving the deployment image, storing user data in a safe location, deploying an image to a target computer, and restoring saved user data. These task sequence steps accomplish their tasks by using utilities and scripts provided with MDT or by the deployment team. Use this reference to help determine the correct task sequence groups and task sequence steps to configure the deployment process and the valid properties and options to use.  

 The following information is provided for each task sequence group and step:  

- **Name**. The name of the task sequence group or step  

- **Description**. A description of the purpose of the task sequence group or step and any pertinent information regarding its customization  

- **Properties**. Indicates the valid configuration properties that you can specify for the task sequence group or step that define how the task is performed  

- **Options**. Indicates the valid configuration options that you can specify for the task sequence group or step that define if and when the task is performed and what is considered a successful exit code from the task  

  For more information about the Task Sequence Editor, see [Operating System Deployment: Task Sequence Editor](../osd/understand/introduction-to-operating-system-deployment.md).  

###  <a name="CommonPropertiesandOptionsforTaskSequenceStepTypes"></a> Common Properties and Options for Task Sequence Step Types

For example, if a runbook has an input parameter named **OSDComputerName**, then the **OSDComputerName** task sequence variable value is passed to the runbook.<br /><br /> Note:<br /><br /> This option works only for input parameters that are valid task sequence variable names and do not contain spaces or other special characters. Although spaces and other special characters are supported as Orchestrator parameter names, they are not valid task sequence variable names. If you need to pass values to parameters with spaces or other special characters, use the **Specify explicit runbook parameters** option.<br /><br /> The other option is **Specify explicit runbook parameters**.<br /><br /> Note:<br /><br /> The values provided for the runbook input parameters to the Orchestrator web service are formatted as XML. Passing values that contain data that is or resembles XML-formatted data may cause errors.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

This is the name of the input runbook parameter.<br /><br /> Note:<br /><br /> If you change the parameters for an existing Orchestrator runbook, you need to browse (reselect) for the runbook again, because MDT only retrieves the parameter list when initially adding the Orchestrator runbook.<br /><br /> - **Value**. This can be a constant or a variable, such as a task sequence variable or an environment variable. For example, you can specify a value of **%OSDComputerName%**, which will pass the value of the **OSDComputerName** task sequence variable to the runbook input parameter.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

## Properties  
 The scripts used in Lite Touch Installation (LTI) and ZTI reference properties to determine the process steps and configuration settings used during the deployment process. The scripts create some of these properties automatically. Other properties must be configured in the CustomSettings.ini file. Some of these properties are:  

- Specific to ZTI only  

- Specific to LTI only  

- For use in both ZTI and LTI  

  Use this reference to help determine the correct properties to configure and the valid values to include for each property.  

  For each property the following information is provided:  

- **Description**.Provides a description of the purpose of the property and any pertinent information regarding the customization of the property.  

  > [!NOTE]
  >  Unless explicitly specified for ZTI or LTI only, a property is valid for both ZTI and LTI.  

- **Value and Description**.Indicates the valid values to be specified for the property and a brief description of what each value means. (Values in italics indicate that a value is substitutedâ€”for example the value *user1*, *user2* indicates that *user1* and *user2* would be replaced with the actual name of user accounts.)  

- **Example**.Provides an example of a property use as it might appear in the .ini files.  

  For more information about these and other task sequence properties that might be referenced while performing a ZTI deployment, see [Operating System Deployment Task Sequence Variables](../develop/osd/how-to-use-task-sequence-variables-in-a-running-task-sequence.md).  

  The deployment scripts generally require values to be specified in upper case so that they are properly read. Therefore, when specifying property values, use uppercase letters.

####  <a name="DeployRoot"></a> DeployRoot  
 Specifies the UNC or local path to the folder that is the root of the folder structure that MDT uses. This folder structure contains configuration files, scripts, and other folders and files that MDT uses. The value of this property is set based on the following MDT deployment technologies:  

-   **LTI**. This property is the UNC path to the deployment share that the Deployment Workbench creates. Use this property to select a specific deployment share. The most common use of this property is in the BootStrap.ini file to identify a deployment share before the connection to the deployment share is established. All other deployment share folders are relative to this property (such as device drivers, language packs, or operating systems).  

-   **ZTI**. This property is the local path to the folder to which the MDT files package is copied. The **Use Toolkit Package** task sequence step copies the MDT files package to a local folder on the target computer, and then automatically sets this property to the local folder.

####  <a name="DNSServerOptionEnableSecureCache"></a> DNSServerOptionEnableSecureCache  
 Determines whether the DNS server attempts to clean up responses to avoid cache pollution. This setting is enabled by default. By default, DNS servers use a secure response option that eliminates adding unrelated resource records that are included in a referral answer to their cache. In most cases, any names that are added in referral answers are typically cached, and they help expedite the resolution of subsequent DNS queries.  

 With this feature, however, the server can determine that referred names are potentially polluting or insecure and then discard them. The server determines whether to cache the name that is offered in a referral on the basis of whether it is part of the exact, related, DNS domain name tree for which the original queried name was made.

####  <a name="DriverGroup"></a> DriverGroup  
 A list of text values that associates out-of-box drivers created in the Deployment Workbench with each other (typically based on the make and model of a computer). A driver can be associated with one or more driver groups. The **DriverGroup** property allows the drivers within one or more groups to be deployed to a target computer.  

 The text values in the list can be any non-blank value. The **DriverGroup** property value has a numeric suffix (for example, **DriverGroup001** or **DriverGroup002**). After it is defined, a driver group is associated with a computer. A computer can be associated with more than one driver group.  

 For example, there are two sections for each of the computer manufacturers [Mfgr01] and [Mfgr02]. Two driver groups are defined for the manufacturer Mfgr01: Mfgr01 Video Drivers and Mfgr01 Network Drivers. For the manufacturer Mfgr02, one driver group is defined, Mfgr02 Drivers. One driver group, Shared Drivers, is applied to all computers found in the [Default] section.

####  <a name="ForceApplyFallback"></a> ForceApplyFallback  
 Controls the method used for installed Windows:  

- **setup.exe**. This method is the traditional method, initiated by running setup.exe from the installation media. MDT uses this method by default.  

- imagex.exe. This method installs the operating system image using imagex.exe with the **/apply** option. MDT uses this method when the setup.exe method cannot be used (i.e., MDT falls back to using imagex.exe).  

  Besides controlling the method used to install these operating systems, this property affects which operating system task sequences are listed in the Deployment Wizard for a specific processor architecture boot image. When the value of this property is set to **NEVER**, only operating system task sequences that match the processor architecture of the boot image are displayed. If the value of this property is set to any other value or is blank, all task sequences that can use the imagex.exe installation method are shown, regardless of the processor architecture.

 If the Loadstate process finishes successfully, the user state information is deleted. In the event of a Loadstate failure (or non-zero return code), the local state store is moved to %WINDIR%\StateStore to prevent deletion and to ensure that no user state information is lost.  

> [!NOTE]
>  Do not add any of the following command-line arguments when configuring this property: **/hardlink**, **/nocompress**, **/decrypt**, **/key**, or **/keyfile**. The MDT scripts will add these command-line arguments if applicable to the current deployment scenario.

####  <a name="Location"></a> Location  
 The geographic location of the target computers. A list of IP addresses that correspond to the default gateways defined for the computers within that location defines the **Location** property. An IP address for a default gateway can be associated with more than one location.  

 Typically, the value for the **Location** property is set by performing a database query on the database managed using Deployment Workbench. Deployment Workbench can assist in creating the locations, defining property settings associated with the locations, and then in configuring CustomSettings.ini to perform the database query for the Location property and the property settings associated with the locations.  

 For example, a `LocationSettings` section in CustomSettings.ini can query the LocationSettings view in the database for a list of locations that contain the value specified in the **DefaultGateway** property listed in the **Parameters** property. The query returns all settings associated with each default gateway.  

 Then the scripts parse each section that corresponds to the locations returned in the query. For example, the value `[Springfield]`and the section `[Springfield-123 Oak Street-4th Floor]` in CustomSettings.ini can represent the corresponding locations. This is an example of how one computer can belong to two locations. The `[Springfield]`section is for all computers in a larger geographic area (an entire city), and the `[Springfield-123 Oak Street-4th Floor]` section is for all computers on the fourth floor at 123 Oak Street, in Springfield.

####  <a name="OSDStateStorePath"></a> OSDStateStorePath  
 LTI and ZTI use this property to set the path where the user state migration data will be stored, which can be a UNC path, a local path, or a relative path.  

> [!NOTE]
>  The **OSDStateStorePath** property takes precedence over the [StatePath](#StatePath) or [UserDataLocation](#UserDataLocation) property when those properties are also specified.  

 In a Replace Computer deployment scenario in ZTI, the [Restore User State](#RestoreUserState) task sequence step is skipped if the **OSDStateStorePath** property is set to a valid local or UNC path. The workaround is to set the [USMTLocal](#USMTLocal) property to TRUE. Doing so forces ZTI UserState.wsf to recognize the path in the [OSDStateStorePath](#OSDStateStorePath) property. This is caused by the **Request State Store** task sequence step being skipped and the previous value in the **OSDStateStorePath** property being retained.  

 In a Replace Computer deployment scenario in ZTI, where user state migration data and the entire computer are being backed up, the Backup.wim file is stored in the folder specified in the **OSDStateStorePath** property. This may be caused by specifying the wrong value for the [ComputerBackupLocation](#ComputerBackupLocation) property.  

 For example, the following CustomSettings.ini file will cause the Backup.wim file to be stored in the same folder specified in the **OSDStateStorePath** property:  

```  
USMTLocal=True  
OSDStateStorePath=\\fs1\Share\Replace  

ComputerBackupLocation=NETWORK  
BackupShare=\\fs1\Share\ComputerBackup

####  <a name="Role"></a> Role  
 The purpose of a computer based on the tasks performed by the user on the target computer. The **Role** property lists text values that can be any non-blank value. The **Role** property value has a numeric suffix (for example, **Role1** or **Role2**). When defined, a role is associated with a computer. A computer can perform more than one role.  

 Typically, the value for the **Role** property is set by performing a database query in the MDT DB. The Deployment Workbench can assist in creating the role and property settings associated with the role, and then the Deployment Workbench can configure CustomSettings.ini to perform the database query for the **Role** property and the property settings associated with the role.

####  <a name="ScanStateArgs"></a> ScanStateArgs  
 Arguments passed to the **USMT Scanstate** process. The scripts call Scanstate.exe, and then insert the appropriate logging, progress, and state store parameters. If this value is not included in the settings file, the user state backup process is skipped.  

> [!NOTE]
>  Use the **USMTMigFiles** property to specify the .xml files to be used by Scanstate.exe instead of using the /I parameter in the **ScanStateArgs** property. This prevents the ZTIUserState.wsf script from potentially duplicating the same list of .xml files.  

> [!NOTE]
>  Do not add any of the following command line arguments when configuring this property: **/hardlink**, **/nocompress**, **/encrypt**, **/key**, or **/keyfile**. The MDT scripts will add these command-line arguments if applicable to the current deployment scenario.

####  <a name="VHDCreateDiffVHD"></a> VHDCreateDiffVHD  
 This property is used to specify the name of a differencing VHD (also known as a *child VHD*) file. A differencing VHD is similar to a dynamically expanding VHD but contains only the modified disk blocks of the associated parent VHD. The parent VHD is read only, so you must modify the differencing VHD. The differencing VHD file is created in the same folder as the parent VHD file, so only the file name is specified in this property. This property is only valid for the MDT New Computer deployment scenario.  

> [!NOTE]

####  <a name="VHDCreateType"></a> VHDCreateType  
 This property is used to specify the type of VHD file that is specified in the **VHDCreateFileName** property and can be one of the following VHD file types:  

- **Fixed VHD file**. For this VHD type, the size of the VHD specified at creation is allocated and does not change automatically after creation. For example, if you create a 24\-gigabyte \(GB\) fixed VHD file, the file will be approximately 24 GB in size \(with some space used for the internal VHD structure\) regardless of how much information is stored in the VHD file.  

- **Dynamically expanding VHD file**. For this VHD type, only a small percentage of the size of the VHD specified at creation time is allocated. Then, the VHD file continues to grow as more and more information is stored in it. However, the VHD file cannot grow beyond the size specified at creation. For example, if you create a 24 GB dynamically expanding VHD, it will be small at creation. However, as information is stored in the VHD file, the file will continue to grow but never exceed the maximum size of 24 GB.  

  This property is only valid for the MDT New Computer deployment scenario.  

> [!NOTE]
>  The maximum size of the VHD file is specified in the **VHDCreateSizeMax** property.  

 This property is commonly set using a task sequence step created using the **Create Virtual Hard Disk \(VHD\)** task sequence type. You can override the value that the **Create Virtual Hard Disk \(VHD\)** task sequence step sets by configuring this property in CustomSettings.ini.

####  <a name="WindowsSource"></a> WindowsSource  
 MDT uses this property to set the location of the sources\sxs folder in a network shared folder that contains the operating system source files. This property is used when:  

- MDT is running a custom task sequence or deploying a custom image  

- MDT is installing roles or features in Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012  

- The computer does not have access to the Internet  

  When the situation described in the bulleted list above occurs, MDT may be unable to find the operating system source files locally, and the installation will attempt to download the files from the Internet. Because the computer does not have Internet access, the process will fail. Setting this property to the appropriate value helps prevent this problem from occurring.

####  <a name="WipeDisk"></a> WipeDisk  
 Specifies whether the disk should be wiped. If **WipeDisk** is TRUE, the ZTIWipeDisk.wsf script will clean the disk using the **Format** command. The **Format** command is not the most "secure" way of wiping the disk.  

 Securely wiping the disk should be done so in a manner that follows the U.S. Department of Defense standard 5220.22-M, which states, "To clear magnetic disks, overwrite all locations three times (first time with a character, second time with its complement, and the third time with a random character)."  

 When MDT wipes the disk, it uses the **Format** command with the **/P:3** switch, which instructs **Format** to zero every sector on the volume and to perform the operation three times. There is no way to tell the **Format** command to use a particular character or a random character.  

> [!NOTE]
>  If the disk must be securely wiped, a non-Microsoft secure disk wipe tool should be added to the task sequence using the **Run Command Line** task sequence step.  

> [!CAUTION]
>  This property value must be specified in uppercase letters so that the deployment scripts can properly read it.

 The list of Windows Update/Microsoft Update software updates to ignore (by associated Knowledge Base articles).  

 Deployment project team members will want to periodically review the list of updates being installed by the ZTIWindowsUpdate.wsf script to verify that each update meets the project's needs and expectations. All updates are logged and recorded in the ZTIWindowsUpdate.log file, which is generated during deployment. Each update will indicate its status as INSTALL or SKIP and lists the UpdateID, the update name, and the QNumber associated with each update. If an update needs to be excluded, that update should be added to the CustomSettings.ini file (for LTI deployments).

Each update will indicate its status as INSTALL or SKIP and lists the UpdateID, the update name, and the QNumber associated with each update. If an update should be excluded, that update should be added to the CustomSettings.ini file (for LTI deployments).  

 For example, if the installation of the Windows Malicious Software Removal Tool should be excluded, look up the line in the ZTIWindowsUpdate.log that shows where the update was identified and installed, and then select the UpdateID number. For example, the UpdateID number for the Windows Malicious Software Removal Tool is adbe6425-6560-4d40-9478-1e35b3cdab4f.

###  <a name="ZTIBIOSCheck.wsf"></a> ZTIBIOSCheck.wsf  
 This script checks the BIOS on the target computer, and then looks at a list of BIOSes that are incompatible with Windows. The list of incompatible BIOSes is stored in the [ZTIBIOSCheck.xml](#ZTIBIOSCheck.xml) file.  

 If the BIOS on the target computer is listed in the [ZTIBIOSCheck.xml](#ZTIBIOSCheck.xml) file, then the script returns a status that indicates the BIOS is incompatible with Windows and the deployment process should be terminated. For information on populating the list of incompatible BIOSes, see [ZTIBIOSCheck.xml](#ZTIBIOSCheck.xml).

###  <a name="ZTICoalesce.wsf"></a> ZTICoalesce.wsf  
 Configuration Manager requires packages to be numbered sequentially starting with **PACKAGES001**, with no gaps in the number sequence. Otherwise, installation will fail.  

 This script allows you to define and name variables using identifying information about the program to runâ€”for example, **ComputerPackages100**, **ComputerPackages110**, or **CollectionPackages150**. Then, when this script is run, Configuration Manager finds all variables that match a pattern (for example, all variable names that contain the string **Packages**) and builds a sequential list, without gaps, using the base name **PACKAGES**.  

 For example, if the following variables were defined (using computer variables, collection variables, or in CustomSettings.ini or the MDT DB, for example):  

- **ComputerPackages100=XXX00001:Program**  

- **ComputerPackages110=XXX00002:Program**  

- **CollectionPackages150=XXX00003:Program**  

- **Packages001=XXX00004:Program**  

  After the script runs, the list would be:  

- **PACKAGES001=XXX00004:Program**  

- **PACKAGES002=XXX00001:Program**  

- **PACKAGES003=XXX00002:Program**  

- **PACKAGES004=XXX00003:Program**  

  Configuration Manager would then be able to run all four programs.

###  <a name="ZTIDiskpart.wsf"></a> ZTIDiskpart.wsf  
 This script creates the disk partitions on the target computer by calling the Diskpart utility. The parameters used to configure the disk are specified by the Task Sequencer or in CustomSettings.ini. ZTIDiskpart.wsf is primarily run in New Computer scenarios. The process works like this:  

1. The MDT deployment process runs the ZTIDiskpart.wsf script based on the steps and sequence of steps in the Task Sequencer.  

2. ZTIDiskpart.wsf starts the Diskpart utility and sends it the required configuration commands.  

3. ZTIDiskpart.wsf runs Diskpart.exe and provides a .txt file as a command-line parameter.  

4. The disk is initially cleaned by sending Diskpart the **CLEAN** command.  

5. If this is the first disk and no disk configuration has been specified by the Task Sequencer or in CustomSettings.ini, a single partition is created to store the operating system. However, if a disk configuration has been specified, the disk will be configured according to the specified configuration.  

6. If BitLocker is to be enabled, space is reserved at the end of the first disk.  

7. All format commands are queued until after Diskpart has finished. If not explicitly specified by the Task Sequencer or in CustomSettings.ini, ZTIDiskpart.wsf performs a quick format of drive C using the following command: `FORMAT C: /FS:NTFS /V:OSDisk /Q /Y`.  

8. ZTIDiskpart.wsf copies the ZTIDiskpart_diskpart.log and BDD.log files from the RAM disk back to the hard drive.  

   Customize the disk configuration of the target computer by providing the required information in the Task Sequencer or in CustomSettings.ini.  

   For more information about configuring disks, see the MDT document *Using the Microsoft Deployment Toolkit*.

###  <a name="ZTIGroups.wsf"></a> ZTIGroups.wsf  
 This script captures and restores the local group membership on the target computer. This script is called with the<strong>/capture</strong> argument to back up the group membership from the target computer before deploying the operating system. The **CaptureGroups** property contains the list of groups that script backs up. The script is called with the<strong>/restore</strong> argument to restore the group membership after the operating system is deployed. When performing a restore operation, it restores the membership of all groups that were backed up when the script was run using the **/capture** argument.  

> [!NOTE]
>  When restoring group membership, the script does not create any destination groups that do not already exist on the target computer. Therefore, be sure to include all required groups in the reference computer when building the image file.

###  <a name="ZTINextPhase.wsf"></a> ZTINextPhase.wsf  
 This script updates the **Phase** property to the next phase in the deployment process. The Task Sequencer uses these phases to determine the sequence in which each task must be completed. The **Phase** property includes the following values:  

- **VALIDATION**. Identify that the target computer is capable of running the scripts necessary to complete the deployment process.  

- **STATECAPTURE**. Save any user state migration data before deploying the new target operating system.  

- **PREINSTALL**. Complete any tasks that need to be done (such as creating new partitions) before the target operating system is deployed.  

- **INSTALL**. Install the target operating system on the target computer.  

- **POSTINSTALL**. Complete any tasks that need to be done before restoring the user state migration data. These tasks customize the target operating system before starting the target computer the first time after deployment (such as installing updates or adding drivers).  

- **STATERESTORE**. Restore the user state migration data saved during the State Capture Phase.  

  For more information about the **Phase** property, see the corresponding topic in [Properties](#Properties).

1. If debugging is activated, the script creates the OSD.Debug file.  

2. The script configures these properties:  

   -   **ScriptRoot**is set to the parent folder of the currently running script.  

   -   **DeployRoot** is set to the parent folder of **ScriptRoot**.  

   -   **ResourceRoot** is set to **DeployRoot**.  

   -   **DeploySystemDrive** is set to **C:**.  

   -   **DeploymentMethod** is set to **SCCM**.  

3. When **DeployRoot**contains **:\\***:*  

   -   The **DeployRoot** folder is copied to **_SMSTSMDataPath**\WDPackage  

   -   **ScriptRoot** is set to **_SMSTSMDataPath**\WDPackage\Scripts  

   -   **DeployRoot** is set to the parent folder of **ScriptRoot**  

   -   **ResourceRoot** is set to **DeployRoot**  

4. When **Phase** is **NULL**:  

   -   If the %SystemDrive% environment variable is **X:**, then **DeploymentType**is set to **NEWCOMPUTER** and **Phase** is set to **PREINSTALL**. Otherwise,**DeploymentType** is set to **REPLACE** and **Phase** is set to **VALIDATION**.  

   -   If the **OldComputer**.tag file exists in the parent folder of the current running script, **DeploymentType** is set to **REPLACE** and **Phase** is set to **VALIDATION**. Otherwise,**DeploymentType** is set to **REFRESH** and **Phase** is set to **VALIDATION**.  

   For more information about these properties, see the corresponding topics in [Properties](#Properties).

###  <a name="ZTIVHDCreate.wsf"></a> ZTIVHDCreate.wsf  
 This script is used to create a virtual hard disk (.vhd or .avhd) file on the target computer and mount the .vhd file as a disk. Then, other portions of the LTI deployment process deploy the Windows operating system and applications to the newly created virtual hard disk. The script processes are as follows:  

-   The **Class_Initialize** method is used to initialize the **VHDInputVariable** variable.  

-   Validate that **VHDCreateSource** is defined and locates the source .vhd file (if specified).

###  <a name="ZTIWindowsUpdate.wsf"></a> ZTIWindowsUpdate.wsf  
 This script downloads and installs updates from computers on a corporate network that are running WSUS, Windows Update, or Microsoft Update using the [Windows Update Agent (WUA)](/windows/win32/wua_sdk/portal-client) application programming interface (API). By default, this feature is disabled in each task sequence and must be manually activated to run.  

 Most enterprises will already have teams and infrastructures in place to update newly deployed computers over the corporate network. This process involves tracking the latest set of patches, drivers, and updates available for each desktop configuration and determining which updates should be downloaded and installed for each configuration. If the organization already has an established process, this script might not be necessary. This script was designed to fill a need for deployment teams that might not have established processes, yet want to ensure that target computers are updated when deployed.  

 This script automatically scans the target computer and downloads a wide range of updates that are found to be applicable. Among these are:  

-   Windows service packs  

-   Non-Microsoft drivers that were placed on Windows Update  

-   The latest hotfix updates  

-   Microsoft Office updates  

-   Microsoft Exchange Server and SQL Server updates  

-   Microsoft Visual Studio&reg; updates  

-   Some non-Microsoft application updates  

> [!TIP]
>  Many hardware manufacturers have placed their drivers on Windows Update. These drivers no longer need to be maintained in the Out-of-Box Drivers directory. Experiment by removing drivers from the distribution share to see which ones are available on Windows Update. Note that if the drivers are not included with Windows by default, do not remove networking or storage drivers, because the operating system will require user input.  

 MDT supports the ability to deploy an updated version of WUA as part of the operating system deployment. This helps ensure that target computers are running the correct version of WUA when they are deployed. It also helps eliminate the need to connect to the Internet and download the latest version of WUA after deployment.  

 MDT can also configure WUA to collect updates from computers on the corporate network that are running WSUS instead of connecting to Microsoft Updates over the Internet. MDT can optionally configure WUA to use a specific computer running WSUS using the **WSUSServer** property.  

 For additional information and for WUA deployment instructions, see [How to Install the Windows Update Agent on Client Computers](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/configuration-manager-archive/how-to-install-the-windows-update-agent-on-client-computers/ba-p/273422).  

 Obtain the latest version of the WUA stand-alone installer for:  

- x86 versions (WindowsUpdateAgent30-x86.exe) at [https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=100334](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=100334)  

- x64 version (WindowsUpdateAgent30-x64.exe) at [https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=100335](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=100335)  

  Windows 7 and later include the most recent version of WUA, so no upgrade is necessary.  

  For more information, see [Updating Windows Update Agent](/windows/win32/wua_sdk/updating-the-windows-update-agent).  

  When enabled in the Task Sequencer, this script runs multiple times while in the State Restore Phase of operating system deployment. It is first run after the operating system has started for the first time. Ensure that the latest updates and service packs are installed before the installation of any applications that might depend on specific updates or service packs being installed on the target computer. For example, an application might be dependent on the latest version of the Microsoft .NET Framework being installed.  

  This script also runs after the installation of applications, which ensures that the latest application service packs and updates have been applied. For example, use this script to ensure that the latest updates are applied to Microsoft Office 2010 or the 2007 Office system.  

  It is possible, during the installation of one or more updates, the target computer will need to be restarted to allow an update installation to finish fully. To ensure that updates are properly installed, if the script detects that the installation of an update requires the target computer to be restarted, the script automatically restarts the target computer and resumes if additional updates have been detected and are pending installation. The script exits if it determines that the target computer is fully up to date. An error will be logged if, while updating the target computer, the script has seven unsuccessful attempts to install the updates and the target computer still requires a restart.  

  During run time, the script performs the following tasks:  

- Configure the target computer to use a WSUS server, if the **WSUSServer** property was specified.  

- Verify that the latest version of the WUA is installed on the target computer.  

- Search the target computer for applicable updates that are not already installed and that might be typically hidden.  

- Each update has an associated **UpdateID** and **QNumber** property:  

  -   The **UpdateID** property is in GUID form, such as *67da2176-5c57-4614-a514-33abbdd51f67*.  

  -   The **QNumber** property is a numerical value, such as *987654*.  

- The script compares the **UpdateID** and **KBArticle** property values against the list of exclusions specified in the following MDT properties:  

  -   **WUMU_ExcludeID**. A list of UpdateIDs to exclude; any update with an **UpdateID** found in this list will not be installed.  

  -   **WUMU_ExcludeKB**. A list of **QNumbers** to exclude; any update with a **QNumber** found in this list will not be installed.  

  -   In addition, any update that requires user input will be excluded and not installed.  

- All updates that require approval of an End User License Agreement (EULA) will automatically be approved by the script. Be sure to manually read and check each EULA before running this script in a production environment.  

- The activity for each update is written to the ZTIWindowsUpdate.log file, with the string INSTALL or SKIP if the update has been approved for installation, along with the UpdateID, a short description of the update, and the QNumber.  

- Each update to be installed is downloaded and installed in batches.  

- The target computer might require more than one restart during the update installation.  

> [!NOTE]
>  Windows Internet Explorer 7 requires user interaction, so it is not installed using this script.  

> [!NOTE]
>  By default, include **QNumber 925471** in the **WUMU_ExcludeKB** list to prevent Windows Vista Ultimate from installing extra language packs.

## Tables and Views in the MDT DB  
 In MDT, many property settings can be stored (typically configured in the CustomSettings.ini file) in a database. Configuring the properties in a database helps create a generic CustomSettings.ini file that requires fewer modifications and allows one CustomSettings.ini file to be used in more images (because the file is more generic).  

 Customize the database in the Database node in the Deployment Workbench. Using the Deployment Workbench, the deployment settings can be configured and saved in tables.  

 However, queries about the information in the tables are done using views. Views help simplify the queries by joining results from multiple tables. ZTIGather.wsf queries the views to return the result set that the **Parameters** and **ParameterCondition** properties specify.  

### Tables in the MDT DB  
 The following table lists the database tables that Deployment Workbench creates and manages.  

|**Table**|**Description**|  
|-|-|  
|ComputerIdentity|Used to identify a specific computer using any combination of the **AssetTag, UUID, SerialNumber**, and **MACAddress** properties. The table includes a **Description** column to provide a user-friendly method of describing the computer (usually the computer name).|  
|Descriptions|Contains descriptions of all properties configurable via the database.|  
|LocationIdentity|Used to identify geographic locations using the **Location** property. The values for this property are stored in a corresponding column in the table.|

## UDI Reference  
 This reference provides further information about UDI and includes topics on:  

- UDI concepts as described in [UDI Concepts](#UDIConcepts)  

- OSDResults as described in [OSDResults Reference](#OSDResultsReference)  

- User Centric App Installer as described in [User-Centric App Installer Reference](#UserCentricAppInstallerReference)  

- UDI stages as described in [UDI Stage Reference](#UDIStageReference)  

- UDI tasks as described in [UDI Task Reference](#UDITaskReference)  

- UDI validators as described in [UDI Validator Reference](#UDIValidatorReference)  

- UDI Wizard Pages as described in [UDI Wizard Page Reference](#UDIWizardPageReference)  

  Each of these reference topics are discussed in subsequent sections.  

###  <a name="UDIConcepts"></a> UDI Concepts  
 This section contains concepts that help describe UDI, the UDI Wizard, and the UDI Wizard Designer.  

####  <a name="DisplayName"></a> Display Name  
 The display name is used to provide a user-friendly, descriptive name for a wizard page within the Page Library in the UDI Wizard Designer. The display name is displayed in blue text for each wizard page in the Page Library and on the **Flow** tab in the UDI Wizard Designer.  

 When you add a page to the Page Library, you must provide the display name. After the wizard page is added to the Page Library, you cannot change the display name.  

####  <a name="Flow"></a> Flow  
 The **Flow** tab displays the list of wizard pages within a UDI stage in the UDI Wizard Designer. You can use the **Flow** tab to perform the following tasks:  

-   Add a wizard page from the Page Library to a UDI stage by dragging the page from the Page Library to the UDI stage.  

-   Remove a wizard page from a UDI stage.  

-   Change the sequence of wizard pages within a UDI stage.  

####  <a name="PageLibrary"></a> Page Library  
 The Page Library contains all the pages currently loaded in the UDI Wizard Designer. When loading a UDI Wizard configuration file, all of the wizard pages defined in the configuration file are displayed to the Page Library. The Page Library shows the wizard pages in alphabetical order by page types. Each instance of a specific page type is listed under the page type.  

 For example, you may need two different **WelcomePage** wizard pages for different stages. The two **WelcomePage** wizard pages will be listed under the **WelcomePage** wizard page type in the Page Library in the UDI Wizard Designer.  

 In addition, each wizard page instance in the Page Library indicates how many times the wizard page is used in the stage flows. When you hover over a wizard page in the Page Library, a thumbnail of the wizard page is displayed along with the stages that include that page.  

####  <a name="PageName"></a> Page Name  
 The page name is used to uniquely identify a wizard page within the Page Library in the UDI Wizard Designer. The *page name* is the name a UDI stage references so that the UDI Wizard knows which wizard page to display within a specific UDI stage. When you add a page to the Page Library, you must provide the page name. After the wizard page is added to the Page Library, you cannot change the page name. In the UDI Wizard Designer, the page name is shown at the bottom of each wizard page in the Page Library in smaller, non-bold text.  

####  <a name="PrestagedMediaDeployments"></a> Prestaged Media Deployments  
 Prestaged media support is an operating system deployment feature in Configuration Manager that allows an administrator to copy and apply prestage bootable media and an operating system image to a hard disk prior to the provisioning process. This work can reduce network traffic and the time needed for the provisioning process. Prestaged media can be deployed as part of the manufacturing process or at an enterprise staging center that is not connected to the Configuration Manager environment.  

 For more information about prestaged media deployments, see the following resources:  

-   [Planning for Media Operating System Deployments in Configuration Manager](/previous-versions/system-center/system-center-2012-R2/hh499044(v=technet.10))  

-   [About Prestaged Media for Operating System Deployment](../osd/deploy-use/create-prestaged-media.md)  

#### Stage Group  
 Use a stage group to group one or more stages in the UDI Wizard Designer. UDI stage groups are loosely related to MDT deployment scenarios, but there is no one-to-one correlation between the two.  

####  <a name="Stage"></a> Stage  
 A *stage* is a subset of all the pages in the UDI Wizard configuration file that an MDT deployment scenario uses. When you start the UDI Wizard using the **UDI Wizard** task sequence step, the **/stage** parameter specifies the stage to run, which in turn specifies the set of pages to use. You can preview how wizard pages will appear in a stage by clicking **Preview** in the **Preview Wizard** group on the Ribbon. You can use a UDI stage in more than one MDT deployment scenario, even though the UDI stage is defined only once in the UDI Wizard Designer. For example, the NewComputer stage can be used in the MDT New Computer and Replace Computer deployment scenarios.  

####  <a name="Task"></a> Task  
 *UDI tasks* are software that is run on a wizard page to perform specific functions. In some instances, these tasks are used to verify that the target computer is ready for deployment. Other tasks can be used to perform deployment steps, such as copying configuration or result files.  

> [!NOTE]
>  The **Next** button on the wizard page where the tasks are run will be disabled if any of the tasks finish with warning or error completion status.  

 UDI includes several built-in tasks that allow you to perform most of the tasks necessary for deployment. For more information about the UDI built-in tasks, see [Built-in UDI Tasks](#BuiltinUDITasks).  

 The **Shell Execute** built-in UDI task allows you to run any software (scripts) that can be initiated from a command line, such as Visual Basic or Windows PowerShell scripts. This functionality allows you create tasks using familiar scripting languages. For more information, see [Shell Execute Task](#ShellExecuteTask).  

 If your requirements go beyond scripting, you can write custom UDI tasks. *UDI tasks* are DLLs written in C++ and implement the **ITask** interface. You register the DLL with the UDI Wizard Designer task library by creating a UDI Wizard Designer configuration (.config) file and placing it in the *installation_folder*\Bin\Config folder (where *installation_folder* is the folder in which you installed MDT). For more information on developing custom UDI tasks, see the section, "Creating Custom UDI Tasks", in the *User-Driven Installation Developers Guide*.  

####  <a name="UDITaskSequence"></a> UDI Task Sequence  
 You create a UDI task sequence using one of the following UDI-specific MDT task sequence templates, which run the UDI Wizard at the appropriate step in the task sequence:  

- **User-Driven Installation Task Sequence.** This task sequence template is used for the New Computer, Refresh Computer, and Replace Computer MDT deployment scenarios.  

- **User-Driven Installation Replace Task Sequence.** This task sequence template is the first step in a two-step process in the Replace Computer deployment scenario and is used to capture user state migration data. The second step in the two-step process is the User-Driven Installation Task Sequence task sequence template, which you use to deploy the target applications and operating system and restore the user state migration data saved during the first step of the process.  

  For more information about UDI task sequence templates, see the section, "Identify the UDI Task Sequence Templates in MDT", in the MDT document *Using the Microsoft Deployment Toolkit*. For more information about these components, see the section, "Identify UDI Deployment Process Components", in the MDT document *Using the Microsoft Deployment Toolkit*, which is included with MDT.  

####  <a name="UDIWizard"></a> UDI Wizard  
 The UDI Wizard provides the UI for collecting deployment settings that the UDI task sequences consume. The UDI Wizard is initiated as a part of a UDI task sequence and collects the necessary configuration information for customizing the deployment of the Windows client operating systems and applications. The wizard pages read their configuration settings from the UDI Wizard configuration file, which is customized using the UDI Wizard Designer.  

 The UDI Wizard is initiated by the **UDI Wizard** task sequence step in task sequences created using the UDI task sequence templates. The **UDI Wizard** task sequence step runs the UDIWizard.wsf script, which in turn initiates the UDI Wizard (OSDSetupWizard.exe). Table 9 lists the UDI Wizard command-line parameters and provides a brief description of each.  

### Table 9. UDI Wizard Command-Line Parameters  

|**Parameter**|**Description**|  
|-|-|  
|**/preview**|Allows you to preview the current configuration of the wizard by enabling the **Next** button, which allows you to move from page to page without requiring valid input.|  
|**/xml**|Specifies the name of the UDI Wizard configuration file. The UDIWizard.wsf script automatically sets this parameter to the OSDSetupWizard.xml file, which is stored in the folder in which the task sequence stores log files. This parameter defaults to the config.xml file.<br /><br /> The syntax for this parameter is as follows (where `<full_path>` is the fully qualified path to the .xml file, including the file name and extension):<br /><br /> `/xml:<full_path>`|  
|**/stage**|Specifies the name of the UDI stage to run. The UDIWizard.wsf script automatically sets this parameter to the appropriate stage, as described in [UDI Stage Reference](#UDIStageReference). This parameter defaults to the first stage in the UDI Wizard configuration file.<br /><br /> The syntax for this parameter is as follows (where `<stage_name>` is the name of the stage to be run):<br /><br /> `/stage:<stage_name>`<br /><br /> Note:<br /><br /> The value for <stage_name> is case sensitive.|  
|**/locale**|Specifies the language to use in the UDI Wizard in the form of a locale identifier (LCID), which is represented by a numeric value. For a list of the available LCIDs, see [Locale IDs Assigned by Microsoft](/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-lcid/a9eac961-e77d-41a6-90a5-ce1a8b0cdb9c).<br /><br /> You would use this list to identify the language you want to use, and then provide the corresponding LCID.<br /><br /> The syntax for this parameter is as follows (where `<locale_id>` is the numeric value of the LCID to be used):<br /><br /> `/locale:<locale_id>`|  

####  <a name="UDIWizardApplicationConfigurationFile"></a> UDI Wizard Application Configuration File  
 The **ApplicationPage** wizard page configures the UDI Wizard application configuration file, which maintains the list of software to be installed. This file contains an entry for each Configuration Manager application or program and package that was added using the UDI Wizard Designer.  

 This file has the same name as the UDI Wizard configuration file but with a .app extension. For example, if the UDI Wizard configuration file is named *Config.xml,* then the corresponding UDI Wizard application configuration file would be *Config.xml.app.* This file is the companion to the UDI Wizard configuration file.  

####  <a name="UDIWizardConfigurationFile"></a> UDI Wizard Configuration File  
 The UDI Wizard reads the UDI Wizard configuration file to determine the wizard pages to be displayed, the sequence of the wizard pages, any default for controls on the wizard pages, and whether the controls are enabled or disabled. This file contains all the configuration settings that are displayed in the UDI Wizard and are configured using the UDI Wizard Designer.  

 A separate configuration fileâ€”the UDI Wizard application configuration fileâ€”is used to configure applications to be installed on the target computer.  

####  <a name="UDIWizardDesigner"></a> UDI Wizard Designer  
 The UDI Wizard Designer is the primary tool for customizing wizard pages for the different deployment scenarios that UDI supports. Changes made in the UDI Wizard Designer are saved in the UDI Wizard configuration file and ultimately reflected in the user experience in the UDI Wizard. The user performing the deployment will see only the wizard pages in the UDI Wizard that you have selected and configured using the UDI Wizard Designer.  

 Although the UDI Wizard would run with the default UDI Wizard configuration file, the wizard pages would not be configured correctly. It is recommended that you use the UDI Wizard Designer to configure the UDI Wizard user experience.  

> [!NOTE]
>  To run the UDI Wizard Designer, you must have the appropriate rights in Configuration Manager to access objects such as packages, applications, or images.  

####  <a name="Validator"></a> Validator  
 You use UDI validators to help ensure that the correct information is entered into text fields on wizard pages in the UDI Wizard. UDI includes several built-in validators that help you perform typical validations of fields used for entering text, such as preventing users from entering invalid characters and ensuring that the field is not empty. When a validator detects an invalid entry in a text box, a message is displayed on the wizard page, and the **Next** button is disabled until all invalid entries are resolved.  

 UDI includes built-in validators that allow you to perform most of the validation necessary for deployment. For more information about the UDI built-in validators, see [Built-in UDI Validators](#BuiltinUDIValidators).  

 If your requirements go beyond the built-in UDI validators, you can write custom UDI validators. *UDI validators* are DLLs written in C++ that implement the **IValidator** interface. Register the DLL with the UDI Wizard Designer validator library by creating a UDI Wizard Designer configuration (.config) file and placing it in the *installation_folder*\Bin\Config folder (where *installation_folder* is the folder in which you installed MDT). For more information on developing custom UDI tasks, see the section, "Creating Custom UDI Validators", in the MDT document *User-Driven Installation Developers Guide*.  

####  <a name="WizardPage"></a> Wizard Page  
 You use a wizard page to collect configuration information in the UDI Wizard. Configure UDI wizard pages using the UDI Wizard Designer. The configuration settings are stored in the UDI Wizard configuration file and are read by the wizard page when the page is initialized in the UDI Wizard.  

 Wizard pages are stored in the wizard Page Library, and they can be used in one or more UDI stages. This design allows you to configure a wizard page that is shared between stages once for all stages, dramatically reducing the amount of effort required and the complexity of updating wizard page configuration.  

 UDI includes built-in wizard pages and wizard page editors that are typically sufficient for most deployments. For more information about the built-in wizard pages, see [Built-in UDI Wizard Pages](#BuiltinUDIWizardPages).  

 If your requirements go beyond the built-in UDI wizard pages and corresponding wizard page editors, you can write custom UDI wizard pages and wizard page editors. UDI wizard pages are implemented as DLLs that the UDI Wizard reads. Wizard page editors are created using C++ in Visual Studio.  

 For more information on developing custom UDI wizard pages, see the section, "Creating Custom UDI Wizard Pages", in the MDT document *User-Driven Installation Developers Guide*.  

####  <a name="WizardPageEditor"></a> Wizard Page Editor  
 You use a wizard page editor to configure a wizard page in the UDI Wizard Designer. A wizard page editor updates the wizard page configuration settings in the UDI Wizard configuration file; UDI includes a built-in wizard page editor for each built-in wizard page. For more information about the built-in wizard pages and wizard page editors, see [Built-in UDI Wizard Pages](#BuiltinUDIWizardPages).  

 If your requirements go beyond the built-in UDI wizard pages and corresponding wizard page editors, you can write custom UDI wizard pages and wizard page editors. UDI wizard page editors are implemented as DLLs that the UDI Wizard Designer reads. Create wizard page editors using:  

- [Windows Presentation Foundation](/dotnet/desktop-wpf/) version 4.0  

- [Microsoft Prism](https://compositewpf.codeplex.com/) version 4.0  

- [Microsoft Unity Application Block](https://unity.codeplex.com/) (Unity) version 2.1  

  For more information on developing custom UDI wizard page editors, see the section, "Creating Custom Wizard Page Editors", in the MDT document *User-Driven Installation Developers Guide*.  

###  <a name="OSDResultsReference"></a> OSDResults Reference  
 **OSDResults** is a part of UDI that displays the results of a deployment performed using UDI. **OSDResults** displays the **Deployment Complete** dialog box. **OSDResults** is displayed prior to Windows logon the first time the target computer is started. The user can use **OSDResults** and the information in the **Deployment Complete** dialog box to determine the completion status of the deployment process and the configuration of the computer prior to logging on for the first time. In addition, the information in **OSDResults** can be used for troubleshooting any problems encountered during the deployment process.  

 You can configure some of the user interface elements for **OSDResults** using the OSDResults.exe.config file, which resides in Tools\OSDResults in the MDT files Configuration Manager package. Table 10 lists the configuration settings in the OSDResults.exe.config file.  

### Table 10. Configuration Settings in the OSDResults.exe.config File  

|**Setting**|**Description**|  
|-|-|  
|**headerImagePath**|This setting allows you to specify the fully qualified or relative path to a .bmp file that is displayed in the header of the **OSDResults** dialog box.<br /><br /> The default value for this setting is as follows:<br /><br /> `images\UDI_Wizard_Banner.bmp`|  
|**backgroundWallpaper**|This setting allows you to specify the fully qualified or relative path to a .jpg file that is displayed as the wallpaper in the **OSDResults** dialog box.<br /><br /> The default value for this setting is as follows:<br /><br /> `images\Wallpaper.jpg`|  
|**welcomeText**|This setting allows you to specify the text that welcomes the user and provides information about the deployment process. It is displayed in the **OSDResults** dialog box.|  
|**completedText**|This setting allows you to specify the text that indicates whether the deployment process is complete. It is displayed in the **OSDResults** dialog box.|  
|**timeoutMinutes**|This setting allows you to specify the length of time the **OSDResults** dialog box is displayed prior to automatically displaying the Windows logon screen. The value for this setting is specified in minutes.<br /><br /> The default value for this setting is zero (0), which indicates that the **OSDResults** dialog box will be displayed indefinitely until manually closed.|  

 The following is the high-level process for how the **OSDResults** feature works in UDI:  

1. A task sequence runs on the target computer.  

    The task sequence is based on one of the followUDI task sequence templates:  

   - **User Driven Installation Task Sequence**. This task sequence template is used for the MDT New Computer, Refresh Computer, and Replace Computer MDT deployment scenarios.  

   - **User-Driven Installation Replace Task Sequence**. This task sequence template is the first step in a two-step process in the MDT Replace Computer deployment scenario and is used to capture user state migration data. The second step in the two step process is the MDT New Computer deployment scenario using the **User Driven Installation Task Sequence** task sequence template, which is used to deploy the target applications and operating system and restore the user state migration data saved during the first step of the process  

     For more information about the:  

   - UDI task sequence templates, see the section, "Identify the UDI Task Sequence Templates in MDT", in the MDT document *Using the Microsoft Deployment Toolkit*  

   - Relationship between MDT deployment scenarios and UDI stages, see [UDI Stage Reference](#UDIStageReference)  

2. During the task sequence, the configuration settings provided by task sequence variables and from user input in the UDI Wizard are saved in the *%DEPLOYROOT%*\Tools\OSDResults folder on the target computer (where *%DEPLOYROOT%* is the root of the folder in which the MDT files are locally cached on the target computer).  

3. In the **OSD Results and Branding** group in the task sequence, the following task sequence steps are run that affect **OSDResults**:  

   -   **Cache OSD Results.** This task sequence step copies the contents of the *%DEPLOYROOT%*\Tools\OSDResults folder to the %WINDIR%\UDI folder on the target computer. This ensures that the contents of the OSDResults folder will be persisted after the task sequence finishes.  

   -   **Run OSD Results.** This tasks sequence step configures the target computer to run **OSDResults** the first time the computer starts.  

4. The target computer starts for the first time, and OSDResults.exe is run prior to the Windows logon screen.  

    The **Welcome** tab in the **Deployment Complete** dialog box is displayed. The **Welcome** tab provides helpful information about the deployment and contact information in the event that issues with the deployment are discovered.  

    Review the information on the **Deployment Summary** and **Applications Installed** tabs to verify that the operating system and applications were installed correctly. When you have completed reviewing these tables, click **Start Windows** to log on to Windows 7 for the first time.  

   > [!NOTE]
   >  Configuration Manager applications are not displayed on the **Applications Installed** tab. The Configuration Manager applications are detected after the user logs on to the target computer the first time.  

5. The Windows logon screen is displayed, and the logon process continues normally.  

    AppInstall.exe is run the first time a user logs on to the target computer. For more information on this process, see [User-Centric App Installer Reference](#UserCentricAppInstallerReference).  

###  <a name="UserCentricAppInstallerReference"></a> User-Centric App Installer Reference  
 The User-Centric App Installer feature in UDI is used to report any applications installed during the UDI deployment process to the Application Catalog feature in Configuration Manager. The User-Centric App Installer feature provides the link between the applications selected on the **ApplicatonPage** wizard page in the UDI Wizard and any optional Configuration Manager applications advertised to the users.  

 For more information on the Application Catalog feature in Configuration Manager, see [Application Management in Configuration Manager](/previous-versions/system-center/system-center-2012-R2/gg699373(v=technet.10)).  

 The following is the high-level process for how the App Install feature works in UDI:  

1. Configuration Manager applications are created in Configuration Manager.  

    For more information about creating and managing Configuration Manager applications, see the following resources:  

   -   [How to Create Applications in Configuration Manager](/previous-versions/system-center/system-center-2012-R2/gg682159(v=technet.10))  

   -   [Operations and Maintenance for Application Management in Configuration Manager](/previous-versions/system-center/system-center-2012-R2/gg681963(v=technet.10))  

2. The Configuration Manager user collections are created, and users are added to the collection.  

    For more information about creating and managing user collections and adding users to collections, see the following resources:  

   -   [Collections in Configuration Manager](/previous-versions/system-center/system-center-2012-R2/gg682169(v=technet.10))  

   -   [How to Create Collections in Configuration Manager](/previous-versions/system-center/system-center-2012-R2/gg712295(v=technet.10))  

3. The Configuration Manager applications are deployed to the user collections.  

    For more information about how to deploy the applications to user collections, see [How to Deploy Applications in Configuration Manager](/previous-versions/system-center/system-center-2012-R2/gg682082(v=technet.10)).  

4. The Configuration Manager applications are made available on the **ApplicatonPage** wizard page using the UDI Wizard Designer.  

    For more information about how to make Configuration Manager applications available on the **ApplicatonPage** wizard page, see the section, "Step 5-11: Customize the UDI Wizard Configuration File for the Target Computer", in the MDT document *Quick Start Guide for User-Driven Installation*.  

5. UDA is configured using one of the following methods:  

   - In the Configuration Manger console (For more information about configuring UDA in the Configuration Manager console, see [How to Manage User Device Affinity in Configuration Manager](/previous-versions/system-center/system-center-2012-R2/gg699365(v=technet.10)).)  

   - On the **UDAPage** wizard page in the UDI Wizard (For more information about the **UDAPage** wizard page, see [UDAPage](#UDAPage).)  

     After UDA is configured, the specified user account will be the primary user for the target computer.  

   > [!NOTE]
   >  UDA can only be configured by UDI in the New Computer deployment scenario. It cannot be configured in the Refresh Computer or Replace Computer deployment scenarios.  

6. The task sequence is run, and the user selects the Configuration Manager applications on the **ApplicatonPage** wizard page in the UDI Wizard.  

    The UDI Wizard is run in the **UDI Wizard** task sequence step in the **Preinstall** group of the task sequence. When the user selects Configuration Manager applications on the **ApplicatonPage** wizard page, the wizard page creates a separate task sequence variable for each application selected.  

    For more information on selecting the Configuration Manager applications on the **ApplicatonPage** wizard page in the UDI Wizard, see the section, "Step 6-4: Start the Target Computer with the Task Sequence Bootable Media", in the MDT document *Quick Start Guide for User-Driven Installation*.  

7. The task sequence installs the Configuration Manager applications that were selected in the previous step.  

    The Configuration Manager applications are installed using the following task sequence steps in the **Install Applications** group in the task sequence:  

   -   **Convert list to two digits**  

   -   **Install Application**  

8. The task sequence performs the following tasks in the **OSD Results and Branding** group prior to starting the target operating system for the first time:  

   -   Copies the information used for OSDResults.exe to the %WINDIR%\UDI folder on the target computer in the **Cache OSD Results** task sequence step  

   -   Records the task sequence variables created in step 6 for the Configuration Manager applications in the registry on the target computer in the **Branding to Reg** and **Branding to Reg x64** task sequence steps  

        The tasks sequence variables are saved in the following location in the registry:  

        **HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\MPSD\OSD**  

   -   Configures the target operating system to automatically run OSDResults.exe when the computer starts prior to the Windows logon screen in the **Run OSD Results** task sequence step  

   -   Configures the target operating system to automatically run AppInstall.exe when a user logs on to the computer for the first time in the **Run OSD Results** task sequence step  

   -   Configures a task on the target operating system to remove the %WINDIR%\UDI folder one month from the date of the deployment  

9. The target computer is started, and OSDResults.exe is run.  

     For more information about OSDResults.exe, see [OSDResults Reference](#OSDResultsReference).  

10. A user logs on to the target computer, and AppInstall.exe starts automatically.  

11. AppInstall checks whether the currently logged-on user is a primary user who was configured in UDA.  

     A *primary user* is a user who uses the device on a regular basis and is considered the owner, or one of the owners, of the device.  

     If the currently logged-on user is:  

    -   Not a primary user, then AppInstall.exe stops  

    -   A primary user, then AppInstall.exe reads the registry entries saved in step 8 to determine which applications were installed  

12. AppIntaller connects to Configuration Manager and reads the Application Catalog using the following steps:  

    1. AppInstall will wait 5 minutes after it starts to allow the Configuration Manager policies to be available.  

    2. After 5 minutes, AppInstall attempts to connect to the Application Catalog.  

    3. If AppInstall is unable to connect, then it will wait for a period of time before attempting to connect again.  

    4. AppInstall attempts to connect up to five times before exiting.  

       You can configure the connection time-out delay and the number of retries for AppInstall using the AppInstall.exe.config file, which resides in the Tools\OSDResults folder in the MDT files Configuration Manager package. Table 11 lists the configuration settings in the AppInstall.exe.config file.  

### Table 11. Configuration Settings in the AppInstall.exe.config File  

|**Setting**|**Description**|  
|-|-|  
|**timeoutMinutes**|This setting allows you to specify the length of time for AppInstall to wait for a response from the Configuration Manager Application Catalog before timing out. The value is specified in minutes. The default value for this setting is **5**.|  
|**delayTimer**|This setting allows you to specify the length of time for AppInstall to wait prior to attempting the connection to the Configuration Manager Application Catalog. The value is specified in minutes. The default value for this setting is **5**.|  

1.  AppInstall compares the list of applications discovered in the registry with the list of applications available from the Configuration Manger Application Catalog for the user currently logged on.  

     If the application discovered in the registry:  

    -   Is available in the Application Catalog, then AppInstall.exe maps the applications and identifies the applications as existing both in the registry and in the Application Catalog. These applications will be used in the following step.  

    -   Is not available in the Application Catalog, then AppInstall.exe does not create a mapping. These applications will not be used in the following step.  

2.  AppInstall uses Configuration Manager APIs to initiate the installation of the mapped applications.  

     The applications used in this step were mapped in the previous step. That is to say, they were both listed in the registry and found in the Application Catalog.  

3.  As a part of the installation process, Configuration Manager detects whether the application is already installed.  

     Because the application has already been installed, Configuration Manager records that the application has been successfully deployed to that user, and the application will be listed in Software Center for that user. Configuration Manager begins management and monitoring of the application for that user.  

4.  After 1 month, the task created on the target computer in step 8 runs and removes the %WINDIR%\UDI folder.  

     The folder is retained for 1 month so that the primary users have an opportunity to be log on and run AppInstall.exe.  

###  <a name="UDIStageReference"></a> UDI Stage Reference  
 The MDT deployment scenarios use one or more UDI [stage](#Stage). Each UDI stage used in the MDT deployment scenarios is discussed in a subsequent section in the context of the MDT deployment scenario. In some MDT deployment scenarios, only one stage is used. In other MDT deployment scenarios, multiple stages are used within the scenario. For more information on the MDT deployment scenarios, see the section, "Identifying Deployment Scenarios", in the MDT document *Using the Microsoft Deployment Toolkit.*  

 Table 12 lists the MDT deployment scenarios and provides a brief description of each, how each scenario is selected, and which UDI stages are used in each deployment scenario. MDT automatically determines which MDT deployment scenario to use based on the MDT task sequence template you use to create your task sequence and on how the task sequence is initiated.  

 Each UDI stage used in the MDT deployment scenarios is discussed in a subsequent section in the context of the MDT deployment scenario. In some MDT deployment scenarios, only one stage is used. In other MDT deployment scenarios, multiple stages are used within the scenario. For more information on the MDT deployment scenarios, see the section, "Identifying Deployment Scenarios", in the MDT document *Using the Microsoft Deployment Toolkit.*  

### Table 12. MDT Deployment Scenarios and UDI Stages  

|**Scenario**|**Description**|   
|-|-|  
|New Computer|MDT for UDI automatically selects this scenario when you:<br /><br /> - Create the advertised task sequence using the User-Driven Installation Task Sequence task sequence template<br /><br /> - Start the task sequence in Windows PE using PXE boot, task sequence boot media, or prestaged media for the NEWCOMPUTER.Prestaged stage<br /><br /> This scenario can be used with traditional deployments or with prestaged media deployments as supported in Configuration Manager. Run the UDI Wizard with the following UDI stages to support each type of deployment:<br /><br /> - **NEWCOMPUTER stage.** The UDI Wizard is run with this stage in the **User-Driven Installation Task Sequence** task sequence when the operating system image is stored on distribution points. For more information, see [NEWCOMPUTER Stage](#NEWCOMPUTERStage).<br /><br /> -                         **NEWCOMPUTER.Prestage stage.** The UDI Wizard is run with this stage in the **User-Driven Installation Task Sequence** task sequence when the operating system image is stored on a local disk on the target computer (prestaged). For more information, see [NEWCOMPUTER.Prestaged Stage](#NEWCOMPUTERPrestagedStage).|  
|Refresh Computer|MDT for UDI automatically selects this scenario when you:<br /><br /> - Create the advertised task sequence using the User-Driven Installation Task Sequence task sequence template<br /><br /> - Start the task sequence in the existing Windows operating system on the target computer (not in Windows PE)<br /><br /> - The UDI Wizard is run with the REFRESH stage to support this deployment scenario. For more information, see [REFRESH Stage](#REFRESHStage).|  
|Replace Computer|This scenario includes an existing computer and a replacement computer. A separate task sequence is created and run on each computer as described in the following process:<br /><br /> -                          **On the existing computer.** MDT for UDI automatically selects this portion of the scenario when you:<br /><br /> - Create the advertised task sequence using the User-Driven Installation Replace Task Sequence task sequence template<br /><br /> Start the task sequence in the existing Windows operating system on the target computer (not in Windows PE)<br /><br /> The UDI Wizard is run with the following UDI stages to support this deployment scenario:<br /><br /> - **REPLACE stage.** This stage is run in the existing Windows operating system and captures configuration information from within Windows.<br /><br /> -                          **REPLACE.WinPE stage.** This stage is run in Windows PE and completes the capturing of configuration information from the existing computerâ€”for example, running USMT and capturing the user state migration data.<br /><br /> The user state is captured to a network shared folder or to a local USB drive.<br /><br /> For more information on the REPLACE and REPLACE.WinPE stages, see [REPLACE and REPLACE.WinPE Stages](#REPLACEandREPLACEWinPEStages).<br /><br /> -                          **On the replacement computer.** This portion of the scenario is identical to the New Computer scenario, except that the user state captured in the previous step is restored. MDT for UDI automatically selects this portion of the scenario when you:<br /><br /> - Create the advertised task sequence using the User-Driven Installation Task Sequence task sequence template<br /><br /> - Start the task sequence in Windows PE using PXE boot, task sequence boot media, or prestaged media for the NEWCOMPUTER.Prestaged stage.<br /><br /> This portion of the scenario can be used with traditional deployments or with prestaged media deployments as supported in Configuration Manager. As a part of this portion of the scenario, the user state migration data is restored. The UDI Wizard is run with the following UDI stages to support each type of deployment:<br /><br /> -                          **NEWCOMPUTER stage.** The UDI Wizard is run with this stage in the **User-Driven Installation Task Sequence** task sequence when the operating system image is stored on distribution points. For more information, see [NEWCOMPUTER Stage](#NEWCOMPUTERStage).<br /><br /> -                          **NEWCOMPUTER.Prestage stage.** The UDI Wizard is run with this stage in the **User-Driven Installation Task Sequence** task sequence when the operating system image is stored on a local disk on the target computer (prestaged). For more information, see [NEWCOMPUTER.Prestaged Stage](#NEWCOMPUTERPrestagedStage).|  

#####  <a name="NEWCOMPUTERStage"></a> NEWCOMPUTER Stage  
 Figure 1 illustrates the use of the NEWCOMPUTER stage in a task sequence created using the User\-Driven Installation Task Sequence task sequence template. The primary difference between the task sequences calling the NEWCOMPUTER stage and the NEWCOMPUTER.Prestaged stage is that the task sequence calling the NEWCOMPUTER.Prestaged stage does not run the **Apply Operating System Image** task sequence step, because the operating system image is already located on the target computer.

###  <a name="UDITaskReference"></a> UDI Task Reference  
 *UDI tasks* are software that is run on a wizard page that perform specific functions. In some instances, these tasks are used to verify that the target computer is ready for deployment. Other tasks can be used to perform deployment steps, such as copying configuration or result files.  

> [!NOTE]
>  The **Next** button on the wizard page where the tasks are run will be disabled if any of the tasks finish with warning or error completion status.  

 This reference includes:  

-   An overview of UDI tasks, as described in [UDI Task Overview](#UDITaskOverview)  

-   A description of the configuration settings for UDI tasks, as described in [UDI Task Configuration Settings](#UDITaskConfigurationSettings)  

-   A description of the built\-in UDI validators that are provided with MDT, as described in [Built\-in UDI Tasks](#BuiltinUDITasks)  

####  <a name="UDITaskOverview"></a> UDI Task Overview  
 UDI tasks allow you to run software on the target computer that helps with the deployment process. UDI includes several built\-in tasks that help you perform common tasks, such as ensuring that the target computer is not running on a battery and is connected to a wired network connection.  

 In addition to the built\-in UDI tasks, you can create custom UDI tasks using the UDI software development kit \(SDK\). For more information about creating custom UDI tasks using the UDI SDK, see *User\-Driven Installation Developers Guide*.  

####  <a name="UDITaskConfigurationSettings"></a> UDI Task Configuration Settings  
 You manage tasks using the UDI Wizard Designer. You can add tasks, remove tasks, and edit the configuration of a task in the UDI Wizard Designer. The configuration settings for a task are stored in the UDI Wizard configuration file and are read by the UDI Wizard when the wizard page that contains the task is displayed.  

 UTI tasks have some configuration settings that are common to all UDI tasks, as listed in Table 13. For the configuration settings that are specific to each UDI task, see the corresponding section in [Built\-in UDI Tasks](#BuiltinUDITasks).  

### Table 13. Configuration Settings Common to All UDI Tasks  

|**Task**|**Description**|  
|-|-|  
|**Bitmap Filename**|This parameter specifies the graphic used to indicate the task type.|  
|**Display Name**|This specifies the name of the task, which is displayed on the wizard page when the task is run.|  
|**Exit Code Values**|This specifies a list of possible return codes for the task. An item exists in the list for each possible return code.|

###  <a name="UDIValidatorReference"></a> UDI Validator Reference  
 UDI validators are used to validate values entered in text fields on wizard pages. When a UDI validator detects an invalid entry, a message is displayed for the first error encountered at the bottom of the wizard page. The next validation error message, if any, is displayed after you resolve the first validation error. This process continues until all validation errors are resolved. The **Next** button is disabled until all validation errors on the wizard page are resolved.  

 This reference includes:  

-   An overview of UDI validators, as described in [UDI Validator Overview](#UDIValidatorOverview)  

-   A description of the built\-in UDI validators provided with MDT, as described in [Built\-in UDI Validators](#BuiltinUDIValidators)  

####  <a name="UDIValidatorOverview"></a> UDI Validator Overview  
 UDI validators are used to help ensure that users provide the correct information in the text fields on wizard pages in the UDI Wizard. UDI includes several built\-in validators that help you perform typical validations of fields used for entering text, such as preventing users from entering invalid characters or ensuring that the field is not empty.  

 In addition to the built\-in UDI validators, you can create custom UDI validators using the UDI SDK. For more information about creating custom UDI validators using the UDI SDK, see the MDT document *User\-Driven Installation Developers Guide*.  

####  <a name="BuiltinUDIValidators"></a> Built-in UDI Validators  
 Table 24 lists the built-in UDI validators. Each built-in validator is discussed in a subsequent section. When a validator detects an invalid entry in a text box, a message is displayed on the wizard page, and the **Next** button is disabled until all invalid entries are resolved.  

### Table 24. Built-in UDI Validators  

|**Validator**|**Description**|  
|-|-|  
|[InvalidChars](#InvalidChars)|This validator identifies any invalid characters that have been entered from a list that you configure.|  
|[NamedPattern](#NamedPattern)|This validator helps ensure that the text follows a predefined pattern.|  
|[NonEmpty](#NonEmpty)|This validator is used to require text in a field.|  
|[RegEx](#RegEx)|This validator allows you ensure that the text matches a regular expression that you specify as a part of the validator.|  

#####  <a name="InvalidChars"></a> InvalidChars  
 This validator prevents users from entering specific characters. The **Message** box allows you to enter a message that is displayed if the text field contains any of the invalid characters. The **Invalid Characters** box allows you to enter the characters that are considered invalid. The characters are entered without spaces between them.  

#####  <a name="NamedPattern"></a> NamedPattern  
 This validator helps ensure that the text follows a predefined pattern. The **Message** box allows you to enter a message that is displayed if the text field does not match the named pattern. The **Named Pattern** box allows you to enter the name of the predefined pattern and must be **Username**, **ComputerName**, or **Workgroup**.  The names are case insensitive.  

#####  <a name="NonEmpty"></a> NonEmpty  
 Use this validator to require text in a field. The **Message** box allows you to enter a message that is displayed if the text field is empty.  

#####  <a name="RegEx"></a> RegEx  
 This validator allows you ensure that the text matches a regular expression that you specify as a part of the validator. The **Message** box allows you to enter a message that is displayed if the text field does not match the regular expression. The **Regular Expression** box allows you to enter the regular expression used for the validation. For more information about how to build regular expressions for this validator, see [TR1 Regular Expressions](/cpp/standard-library/regular-expressions-cpp).  

###  <a name="UDIWizardPageReference"></a> UDI Wizard Page Reference  
 You add a UDI [wizard page](#WizardPage) to stages from the [Page Library](#PageLibrary) in the [UDI Wizard Designer](#UDIWizardDesigner). UDI wizard pages are displayed in the [UDI Wizard](#UDIWizard).  

 This reference includes:  

-   An overview of UDI wizard pages, as described in [UDI Wizard Page Overview](#UDIWizardPageOverview)  

-   A description of the built-in UDI wizard pages that are provided with MDT, as described in [Built-in UDI Wizard Pages](#BuiltinUDIWizardPages)  

####  <a name="UDIWizardPageOverview"></a> UDI Wizard Page Overview  
 Wizard pages are displayed in the [UDI Wizard](#UDIWizard) and collect the information required to complete the deployment process. You create wizard pages using C++ in Visual Studio. The custom wizard pages are implemented as DLLs that the UDI Wizard reads.  

 Each built-in UDI wizard page has a corresponding UDI [wizard page editor](#WizardPageEditor), which you use to configure the wizard page in the [UDI Wizard Designer](#UDIWizardDesigner).  

 In addition to the built-in UDI wizard pages, you can create custom UDI wizard pages using the UDI SDK. For more information about creating custom UDI wizard pages using the UDI SDK, see the MDT document *User-Driven Installation Developers Guide*.  

 Each wizard page can reference the following types of variables:  

- Task sequence variables  

- Memory variables  

- Environment variables  

  You can reference task sequence and environment variables by bracketing the variable using percent signs (%), such as *%OSDImageIndex%.* You can reference memory variables by bracketing the variable using dollar signs ($), such as *$VolumeArchitecture$.*  

> [!NOTE]
>  If a task sequence variable and an environment variable both have the same name, then the task sequence variable takes precedence over the environment variable.  

 Table 25 lists the memory variables that are set when the UDI Wizard starts, the description of the variables, and whether the UDI Wizard reads or writes the variables during startup.

#####  <a name="ComputerPage"></a> ComputerPage  
 Use this wizard page to configure the computer name of the target computer, the domain or workgroup to join, and the credentials to be used when joining a domain. When you configure this page to join the target computer to a domain, this wizard page will validate the credentials you provide for joining the domain in AD DS by default. Then, this wizard page attempts to modify a computer object in AD DS to verify that the user credentials provided on this page have permissions to create or modify the computer object. You can disable either of these behaviors. If you disable the validation of the credentials, then the verification of permissions for creating or modifying computer objects is also disabled. Both of these validations occur when the **Next** button is clicked. If either of the validations encounters an error, an error message will be displayed and this page will continue to be displayed.  

 The following is the order of precedence for determining the default computer name:  

1.  If the **UserExistingComputerName** value in the UDI Wizard configuration file is set to **TRUE**, then the existing computer name is used \(if present\).  

2.  If the **OSDComputerName** task sequence variable is set, then the computer name in that variable is used.  

3.  If a default value is specified for the computer name in the UDI Wizard configuration file, then that value is used.

#####  <a name="UserStatePage"></a> UserStatePage  
 Use this wizard page to configure the settings for capturing or restoring user state migration data. This wizard page is used for both user state migration data capture and restore.  

 The **UserStatePage** can capture or restore user state migration data from a disk locally attached to the target computer, a USB drive attached to the target computer, or a network shared folder. In addition, you can select to not restore any user data. The code logic behind the wizard page enables, disables, or automatically selects each of the following options based on the deployment scenario and whether the disk is being formatted:  

-   **No Data to Restore.** This option indicates that there is no user state migration data to restore and sets the **OSDUserStateMode** task sequence variable and **UserStateMode** variable to **NoData**.  

-   **Local.** This option indicates that the user state migration data should be stored on a disk locally attached to the target computer and sets the **OSDUserStateMode** task sequence variable and **UserStateMode** variable to **Local**.  

-   **USB.** This option indicates that the user state migration data should be stored on a USB disk locally attached to the target computer and sets the **OSDUserStateMode** task sequence variable and **UserStateMode** variable to **USB**.  

-   **Network.** This option indicates that the user state migration data should be stored on a network shared folder and sets the **OSDUserStateMode** task sequence variable and **UserStateMode** variable to **Network**.  

######  <a name="NEWCOMPUTERStageBehavior"></a> NEWCOMPUTER Stage Behavior  
 The NEWCOMPUTER stage is used for computers on which no user state migration data exists. The New Computer deployment scenario can be used as the second part of the Replace Computer deployment scenario. If the user selects to:  

- Format the disk on the target computer, then the **UserStatePage** assumes that no user state migration data is located on the local hard disk, so the **Local** option is disabled and all other options are enabled  

- Not format the disk on the target computer, then the **UserStatePage** assumes that there is user state migration data to be restored, and all options are disabled other than the **Local** option \(Using the **Local** option provides a faster method for restoring the user state migration data than the USB or network shared folder methods.\)  

  Table 36 lists the behavior of the options on the wizard page for the NEWCOMPUTER stage. The **Format** column indicates whether the target hard disk is to be formatted as a part of the deployment. The other columns indicate the configuration of the options when the **UserStatePage** is loaded.  

### Table 36. Behavior of Options for the NEWCOMPUTER Stage  

|**Format**|**NoData**|**Local**|**USB**|**Network**|  
|-|-|-|-|-|  
|Yes|Enabled|Disabled|Enabled|Enabled|  
|No|Disabled|Selected|Disabled|Disabled|  

######  <a name="NewComputerPrestagedStageBehavior"></a> NewComputer.Prestaged Stage Behavior  
 The NEWCOMPUTER.Prestaged stage is based on the prestaged media feature in Configuration Manager. Because the local hard disk is new, there is no user state migration data to be restored from the local hard disk, so the **Local** option is disabled. All other options are valid for this deployment scenario and are enabled. No default option is selected.  

 Table 37 lists the behavior of the options on the wizard page for the NewComputer.Prestaged stage. The **Format** column indicates whether the target hard disk is to be formatted as a part of the deployment. The other columns indicate the configuration of the options when the **UserStatePage** is loaded.  

### Table 37. Behavior of Options for the NewComputer.Prestaged Stage  

|**Format**|**NoData**|**Local**|**USB**|**Network**|  
|-|-|-|-|-|  
|N\/A|Enabled|Disabled|Enabled|Enabled|  

######  <a name="REFRESHStageBehavior"></a> REFRESH Stage Behavior  
 The REFRESH stage is initiated in a full Windows operating system, instead of Windows PE. If the user selects to:  

- Format the disk on the target computer, then the **UserStatePage** assumes that no user state migration data is to be restored, and all options are disabled other than the **NoData** option  

- Not format the disk on the target computer, then the **UserStatePage** assumes that there is user state migration data to be restored, and all options are disabled other than the **Local** option \(Using the **Local** option provides a faster method for restoring the user state migration data than the USB or network shared folder methods.\)  

  Table 38 lists the behavior of the options on the wizard page for the REFRESH stage. The **Format** column indicates whether the target hard disk is to be formatted as a part of the deployment. The other columns indicate the configuration of the options when the **UserStatePage** is loaded.  

### Table 38. Behavior of Options for the REFRESH Stage  

|**Format**|**NoData**|**Local**|**USB**|**Network**|  
|-|-|-|-|-|  
|Yes|Selected|Disabled|Disabled|Disabled|  
|No|Disabled|Selected|Disabled|Disabled|  

######  <a name="REPLACEWinPEStageBehavior"></a> REPLACE.WinPE Stage Behavior  
 The REPLACE.WinPE stage captures the user state migration data from the existing \(old\) computer, and then restores the user state migration data later using one of the New Computer deployment scenarios. Because two different computers are involved in the deployment, the user state migration data must be saved to a USB drive or to a network shared folder. Saving user state migration data to a local disk is unavailable.  

 Table 39 lists the behavior of the options on the wizard page for the REPLACE.WinPE stage. The **Format** column indicates whether the target hard disk is to be formatted as a part of the deployment. The other columns indicate the configuration of the options when the **UserStatePage** is loaded.  

### Table 39. Behavior of Options for the REPLACE.WinPE Stage  

|**Format**|**NoData**|**Local**|**USB**|**Network**|

 Use this wizard page to provide information to the user about the UDI Wizard and the deployment process. You can configure the notification message using the UDI Wizard Designer.  

### UDI Build Your Own Page Toolbox Control Reference  
 The Build Your Own Page feature in UDI allows you to create custom wizard pages that you can use to collect additional deployment information for use in UDI. You can create custom wizard pages using the:  

- **Build Your Own Page feature.** This feature allows you to create a custom wizard page for collecting deployment information without requiring you to write code or have developer skills. Use this feature if you need to collect basic information without advanced user interaction. For example, you cannot add any code or customize UI fonts using this feature.  

- **UDI SDK and Visual Studio**. Use this SDK if you want to create an advanced, fully customized wizard page in Visual Studio for collecting deployment information. Although the UDI SDK allows you to create customized wizard pages, such as adding custom code or changing fonts, this method requires developer skills.  

   For more information on using the UDI SDK to create custom wizard pages, see "Creating Custom UDI Wizard Pages" in the *User-Drive Installation Developers Guide*.  

  The Build Your Own Page feature includes a toolbox of controls that you can add to your custom wizard page from the Build Your Own Page toolbox, which is displayed when you view the custom wizard page on the **Configure** tab in the UDI Wizard Designer.  

  Table 45 lists the types of controls to your custom wizard page, which is illustrated in Figure 5. Each of these controls is discussed in further detail in a subordinate section.  

### Table 45. Types of Controls in the UDI Build Your Own Page Toolbox  

|**Control type**|**Description**|  
|-|-|  
|[Checkbox control](#CheckboxControl)|This control allows you select or clear a configuration option and behaves as a traditional UI check box.|  
|[Combobox control](#ComboboxControl)|This control allows you to select an item from a list of items and behaves as a traditional UI drop-down list.|  
|[Line control](#LineControl)|This control allows you to add a horizontal line to divide one portion of the custom wizard page from another.|  
|[Label control](#LabelControl)|This control allows you to add descriptive, read-only text to the wizard page.|  
|[Radio control](#RadioControl)|This control allows you to select one configuration option from a group of two or more options.|  
|[Bitmap control](#BitmapControl)|This control allows you to add a bitmap graphic (.bmp file) to the custom wizard page.|  
|[Textbox control](#TextboxControl)|This control allows you to enter text on the custom wizard page.|  

 You can add any combination of these controls to your custom wizard page based on the information you want to collect. In addition, you can use the **Show Gridlines** check box to show or hide gridlines that can be used to assist in visually designing the custom wizard page.  

 Figure 5 provides an example of a custom wizard page and the Build Your Own Page toolbox.
