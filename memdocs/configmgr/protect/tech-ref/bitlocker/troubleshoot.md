# Troubleshoot BitLocker

*Applies to: Configuration Manager (current branch)*

Use the information in this article to help you troubleshoot issues with BitLocker management in Configuration Manager.

## Server error in self-service

When trying to open the self-service portal (`https://webserver.contoso.com/SelfService`) for the first time, you see the following error message:

``` error
Configuration Error - Server Error in '/SelfService' Application

Description: An error occurred during the processing of a configuration file required to service this request. Please review the specific error details below and modify your configuration file appropriately.

Parser Error Message: Could not load file or assembly 'System.Web.Mvc, Version=4.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=31bf3856ad364e35' or one of its dependencies. The system cannot find the file specified.
```

To fix this issue, make sure you installed the [prerequisite](../../plan-design/bitlocker-management.md#prerequisites) for **Microsoft ASP.NET MVC 4.0** on the web server.
