# Client event logs

*Applies to: Configuration Manager (current branch)*

<!--3601034-->

On a Configuration Manager client to which you deploy a BitLocker management policy, use the Windows Event Viewer to view BitLocker client event logs. Go to **Applications and Services Logs**, **Microsoft**, **Windows**, **MBAM** for both [Admin](#admin) and [Operational](#operational) event logs.

## Admin

### 2: VolumeEnactmentFailed

An error occurred while applying MBAM policies.

#### Error code: -2144272219

Details: BitLocker Drive Encryption only supports Used Space Only encryption on thin provisioned storage.

This error occurs if you try to use BitLocker to encrypt a virtual machine that's running Windows 10 version 1803 or earlier. Earlier versions of Windows 10 don't support full disk encryption. BitLocker management policies enforce full disk encryption.

#### Error code: -2147024774

Details: The data area passed to a system call is too small.

To resolve this issue, restart the computer.

### 4: TransferStatusDataFailed

An error occurred while sending encryption status data.

### 8: SystemVolumeNotFound

The system volume is missing. SystemVolume is needed to encrypt the operating system drive.

### 9: TPMNotFound

The TPM hardware is missing. TPM is needed to encrypt the operating system drive with any TPM protector.

### 10: MachineHWExempted

The computer is exempted from Encryption. Machine's hardware status: Exempted

### 11: MachineHWUnknown

The computer is exempted from encryption. Machine's hardware status: Unknown

### 12: HWCheckFailed

Hardware exemption check failed.

### 13: UserIsExempted

The user is exempt from encryption.

### 14: UserIsWaiting

The user requested an exemption.

### 15: UserExemptionCheckFailed

User exemption check failed.

### 16: UserPostponed

#### Error code: -2147024809

Details: The parameter is incorrect.

This error occurs if the website isn't HTTPS, or the client doesn't have a PKI cert.

### 20: PolicyMismatch

The BitLocker management policy is in conflict or corrupt.

### 21: ConflictingOSVolumePolicies

Detected OS volume encryption policies conflict. Check BitLocker policies related to OS drive protectors.

### 22: ConflictingFDDVolumePolicies

Detected fixed data drive volume encryption policies conflict. Check BitLocker policies related to fixed data drive drive protectors.

### 27: EncryptionFailedNoDra

An error occurred while encrypting. A data recovery agent (DRA) protector is required in FIPS mode for pre-Windows 8.1 machines.

### 34: TpmLockOutResetFailed

Failed to reset TPM lockout.

### 36: TpmOwnerAuthRetrievalFailed

Failed to retrieve TPM OwnerAuth from MBAM services.

### 37: WmiProviderDllSearchPathUpdateFailed
