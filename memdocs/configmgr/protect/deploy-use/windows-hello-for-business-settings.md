# Windows Hello for Business settings in Configuration Manager

*Applies to: Configuration Manager (current branch)*

<!--1245704-->
Configuration Manager integrates with Windows Hello for Business. (This feature was formerly known as Microsoft Passport for Work.) Windows Hello for Business is an alternative sign-in method for Windows 10 devices. It uses Active Directory or a Microsoft Entra account to replace a password, smart card, or virtual smart card. Hello for Business lets you use a *user gesture* to sign in instead of a password. A user gesture might be a PIN, biometric authentication, or an external device such as a fingerprint reader.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Starting in version 2203, this company resource access feature is no longer supported.<!-- 9315387 --> For more information, see [Frequently asked questions about resource access deprecation](../plan-design/resource-access-deprecation-faq.yml).
>
> Active Directory Federation Services Registration Authority (ADFS RA) deployment is simpler, provides a better user experience, and has a more deterministic certificate enrollment experience. Use ADFS RA for certificate-based authentication with Windows Hello for Business.

> [!Note]  
> Configuration Manager doesn't enable this optional feature by default. You must enable this feature before using it. For more information, see [Enable optional features from updates](../../core/servers/manage/optional-features.md).<!--505213-->  

Configuration Manager integrates with Windows Hello for Business in the following ways:  

- Control which gestures users can and can't use to sign in.  

- Store authentication certificates in the Windows Hello for Business key storage provider (KSP). For more information, see [Certificate profiles](introduction-to-certificate-profiles.md).  

- Create and deploy a Windows Hello for Business profile to control its settings on domain-joined Windows 10 devices that run the Configuration Manager client. Starting in version 1910, you can't use certificate-based authentication. When using key-based authentication, you don't need to deploy a certificate profile.

## Configure a profile  

1. In the Configuration Manager console, go to the **Assets and Compliance** workspace. Expand **Compliance Settings**, expand **Company Resource Access**, and select the **Windows Hello for Business Profiles** node.

1. In the ribbon, select **Create Windows Hello for Business Profile** to start the profile wizard.

1. On the **General** page, specify a name and an optional description for this profile.

1. On the **Supported Platforms** page, select the OS versions to which this profile should apply.

1. On the **Settings** page, configure the following settings:

    - **Configure Windows Hello for Business**: Specify whether this profile enables, disables, or doesn't configure Hello for Business.

    - **Use a Trusted Platform Module (TPM)**: A TPM provides an additional layer of data security. Choose one of the following values:  

      - **Required**: Only devices with an accessible TPM can provision Windows Hello for Business.  

      - **Preferred**: Devices first attempt to use a TPM. If it's not available, they can use software encryption.

    - **Authentication method**: Set this option to **Not configured** or **Key-based**.

        > [!NOTE]
        > Starting in version 1910, certificate-based authentication with Windows Hello for Business settings in Configuration Manager isn't supported.

    - **Configure minimum PIN length**: If you want to require a minimum length for the user's PIN, enable this option and specify a value. When enabled, the default value is `4`.

    - **Configure maximum PIN length**: If you want to require a maximum length for the user's PIN, enable this option and specify a value. When enabled the default value is `127`.

    - **Require PIN expiration (days)**: Specifies the number of days before the user must change the device PIN.

    - **Prevent reuse of previous PINs**: Don't allow users to use PINs they have previously used.

    - **Require upper-case letters in PIN**: Specifies whether users must include uppercase letters in the Windows Hello for Business PIN. Choose from:  

      - **Allowed**: Users can use uppercase characters in their PIN, but don't have to.

      - **Required**: Users must include at least one uppercase character in their PIN.  

      - **Not allowed**: Users can't use uppercase characters in their PIN.  

    - **Require lower-case letters in PIN**: Specifies whether users must include lowercase letters in the Windows Hello for Business PIN. Choose from:  

      - **Allowed**: Users can use lowercase characters in their PIN, but don't have to.

      - **Required**: Users must include at least one lowercase character in their PIN.  

      - **Not allowed**: Users can't use lowercase characters in their PIN.  

    - **Configure special characters**: Specifies the use of special characters in the PIN. Choose from:  

        > [!NOTE]
        > Special characters include the following set:
        >
        > ``` characters
        > ! " # $ % & ' ( ) * + , - . / : ; < = > ? @ [ \ ] ^ _ ` { | } ~
        > ```

      - **Allowed**: Users can use special characters in their PIN, but don't have to.  

      - **Required**: Users must include at least one special character in their PIN.  

      - **Not allowed**: Users can't use special characters in their PIN. This behavior is also if the setting is **Not configured**.  

    - **Configure the use of digits in PIN**: Specifies the use of numbers in the PIN. Choose from:

      - **Allowed**: Users can use numbers in their PIN, but don't have to.  

      - **Required**: Users must include at least one number in their PIN.  

      - **Not allowed**: Users can't use numbers in their PIN.

    - **Enable biometric gestures**: Use biometric authentication such as facial recognition or fingerprint. These modes are an alternative to a PIN for Windows Hello for Business. Users still configure a PIN in case biometric authentication fails.  

      If set to **Yes**, Windows Hello for Business allows biometric authentication. If set to **No**, Windows Hello for Business prevents biometric authentication for all account types.  

    - **Use enhanced anti-spoofing**: Configures enhanced anti-spoofing on devices that support it. If set to **Yes**, where supported, Windows requires all users to use anti-spoofing for facial features.  

    - **Use Phone Sign In**: Configures two-factor authentication with a mobile phone.

1. Complete the wizard.
