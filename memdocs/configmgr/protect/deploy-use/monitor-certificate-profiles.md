# How to monitor certificate profiles in Configuration Manager

*Applies to: Configuration Manager (current branch)*

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Starting in Configuration Manager version 2103, this company resource access feature is [deprecated](../../core/plan-design/changes/deprecated/removed-and-deprecated-cmfeatures.md).<!-- 9315387 --> Use Microsoft Intune to [deploy resource access profiles](../../../intune/configuration/device-profiles.md).

##  View Compliance Results in the Configuration Manager Console  

To monitor SCEP certificate compliance  do not use the console, rather, use [reports](#view-compliance-results-by-using-reports). 

1. In the Configuration Manager console, choose **Monitoring**>  **Deployments**.  

2. Select the certificate profile deployment of interest.  

3. Review summary certificate compliance information on the main page. For more detailed information, select the certificate profile, and then on the **Home** tab, in the **Deployment** group, choose **View Status** to open the **Deployment Status** page.  

    The **Deployment Status** page contains the following tabs:  

   -   **Compliant**: Displays the compliance of the certificate profile based on the number of assets that are affected. You can double-click a rule to create a temporary node under the **Users** node in the **Assets and Compliance** workspace. This node contains all users that are compliant with the certificate profile. The **Asset Details** pane also displays the users that are compliant with this profile. Double-click a user in the list for more information.  

       > [!IMPORTANT]  
       >  A certificate profile is not evaluated if it is not applicable on a client device. However, it is returned as compliant.  

   -   **Error**: Displays a list of all errors for the selected certificate profile deployment based on the number of assets that are affected. You can double-click a rule to create a temporary node under the **Users** node of the **Assets and Compliance** workspace. This node contains all users that generated errors with this profile. When you select a user, the **Asset Details** pane displays the users that are affected by the selected issue. Double-click a user in the list to display for more information.  

   -   **Non-Compliant**: Displays a list of all noncompliant rules within the certificate profile based on the number of assets that are affected. You can double-click a rule to create a temporary node under the **Users** node of the **Assets and Compliance** workspace. This node contains all users that are not compliant with this profile. When you select a user, the **Asset Details** pane displays the users that are affected by the selected issue. Double-click a user in the list to display further information about the issue.  

   -   **Unknown**: Displays a list of all users that did not report compliance for the selected certificate profile deployment together with the current client status of the devices.  

4. On the **Deployment Status** page, review detailed information about the compliance of the deployed certificate profile. A temporary node is created under the **Deployments** node that helps you find this information again quickly.  

    The enrollment status of the certificate is displayed as a number. Use the following table to understand what each number means:  


   | Enrollment status |                                                                                                                   Description                                                                                                                   |

##  View Compliance Results by Using Reports

Compliance settings in Configuration Manager include built-in reports that you can use to monitor information about certificate profiles. These reports have the report category of **Compliance and Settings Management**.  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  You must use a wildcard (%) character when you use the parameters **Device filter** and **User filter** in the reports for compliance settings.  

To monitor SCEP certificate compliance  use these  certificate reports under the report node **Company Resource Access**:  

-   Certificate issuance history  
-   List of assets with certificates nearing expiry  
-   List of assets by certificate issuance status
