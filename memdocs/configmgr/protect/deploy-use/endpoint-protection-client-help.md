# Endpoint Protection Client Help

*Applies to: Configuration Manager (current branch)*


This version of Windows Defender or Endpoint Protection includes the following features to help protect your computer from threats:  

-   **Windows Firewall integration.** Endpoint Protection setup enables you to turn on or off Windows Firewall.  
-   **Network Inspection System.** This feature enhances real-time protection by inspecting network traffic to help proactively block exploitation of known network-based vulnerabilities.  
-   **Protection engine.** Real-time protection finds and stops malware from installing or running on your PC. The updated engine offers enhanced detection and cleanup capabilities with better performance.  

Windows Defender comes as part of the Windows 10 operating system.  On earlier versions of Windows, your administrator can provide either Windows Defender or Endpoint Protection using management software.

For help troubleshooting, see [Troubleshooting Windows Defender or Endpoint Protection client](troubleshoot-endpoint-client.md). For a list of new features, see [What's new Windows Defender client](https://support.microsoft.com/help/29276/windows-10-whats-new-in-windows-defender).

## Windows Firewall integration  
 Windows Firewall can help prevent attackers or malicious software from gaining access to your computer through the Internet or a network. Now when you install Endpoint Protection, the installation wizard verifies that Windows Firewall is turned on. If you have intentionally turned off Windows Firewall, you can avoid turning it on by clearing a check box. You can change your Windows Firewall settings at any time via the System and Security settings in Control Panel.  

## Network Inspection System  
 Attackers are increasingly carrying out network-based attacks against exposed vulnerabilities before software vendors can develop and distribute security updates. Studies of vulnerabilities show that it can take a month or longer from the time of an initial attack report before a suitable security update is developed, tested, and released. This gap in protection leaves many computers vulnerable to attacks and exploitation for a substantial period of time. Network Inspection System works with real-time protection to better protect you against network-based attacks by greatly reducing the timespan between vulnerability disclosures and update deployment from weeks to a few hours.  

## Award-winning protection engine  
 Under the hood of Windows Defender or Endpoint Protection is its award-winning protection engine that is updated regularly. The engine is backed by a team of antimalware researchers from the Microsoft Malware Protection Center, providing responses to the latest malware threats 24 hours a day.  

## Windows Defender settings
Windows Defender settings enable settings that help protect your PC from malicious software. Your administrator might manage some Windows Defender settings for you. You can manage others using the Windows Defender settings. We recommend you enable Windows Defender settings to help protect your PC and data.

To view Windows Defender settings, search for `Windows Defender` on your PC. Open **Windows Defender** and select **Settings**. Windows Defender settings include:
- **Real-time protection** - Find and stop malware from installing or running on your PC.
- **Cloud-based Protection** - Windows Defender sends info to Microsoft about potential security threats.
- **Automatic sample submission** - Allow Windows Defender to send samples of suspicious files to Microsoft to help improve malware detection.
- **Exclusions** - You can exlude specific files, folders, file extensions, or processes from Windows Defender scanning.
- **Enhanced notification** - Enables notifications that inform about the health of your PC. Even **Off** you will receive critical notifications.
- **Windows Defender Offline** - You can run Windows Defender Offline to help find and remove malicious software. This scan will restart your PC and will take about 15 minutes.
