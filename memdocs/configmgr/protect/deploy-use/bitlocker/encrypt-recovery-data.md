# Encrypt recovery data

*Applies to: Configuration Manager (current branch)*

<!--3601034-->

When you create a BitLocker management policy, Configuration Manager deploys the recovery service to a management point. On the **Client Management** page of the BitLocker management policy, when you **Configure BitLocker Management Services**, the client backs up key recovery information to the site database. This information includes BitLocker recovery keys, recovery packages, and TPM password hashes. When users are locked out of their protected device, you can use this information to help them recover access to the device.

Given the sensitive nature of this information, you need to protect it in the following circumstances:

- Configuration Manager requires an HTTPS connection between the client and the recovery service to encrypt the data in transit across the network. There are two options:

  - HTTPS-enable the IIS website on the management point that hosts the recovery service, not the entire management point role. This option only applies to Configuration Manager version 2002.<!-- 5925660 -->

  - Configure the management point for HTTPS. On the properties of the management point, the **Client connections** setting must be **HTTPS**. This option applies to Configuration Manager versions 1910 or 2002.

    > [!NOTE]
    > It currently doesn't support Enhanced HTTP.

- Consider also encrypting this data when stored in the site database. You can use SQL Server cell-level encryption with your own certificate.

    If you don't want to create a BitLocker management encryption certificate, opt-in to plain-text storage of the recovery data. When you create a BitLocker management policy, enable the option to **Allow recovery information to be stored in plain text**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Another layer of security is to encrypt the entire site database. If you enable encryption on the database, there aren't any functional issues in Configuration Manager.
    >
    > Encrypt with caution, especially in large-scale environments. Depending upon the tables you encrypt and the version of SQL, you may notice up to a 25% performance degradation. Update your backup and recovery plans, so that you can successfully recover the encrypted data.

## Certificate requirements

### HTTPS server authentication certificate

<!--5925660-->

In Configuration Manager current branch version 1910, to integrate the BitLocker recovery service you had to HTTPS-enable a management point. The HTTPS connection is necessary to encrypt the recovery keys across the network from the Configuration Manager client to the management point. Configuring the management point and all clients for HTTPS can be challenging for many customers.

Starting in version 2002, the HTTPS requirement is for the IIS website that hosts the recovery service, not the entire management point role. This change relaxes the certificate requirements, and still encrypts the recovery keys in transit.

Now the **Client connections** property of the management point can be **HTTP** or **HTTPS**. If the management point is configured for **HTTP**, to support the BitLocker recovery service:

1. Acquire a server authentication certificate. Bind the certificate to the IIS website on the management point that hosts the BitLocker recovery service.

2. Configure clients to trust the server authentication certificate. There are two methods to accomplish this trust:

    - Use a certificate from a public and globally trusted certificate provider. For example, but not limited to, DigiCert, Thawte, or VeriSign. Windows clients include trusted root certificate authorities (CAs) from these providers. By using a server authentication certificate that's issued by one of these providers, your clients should automatically trust it.

    - Use a certificate issued by a CA from your organization's public key infrastructure (PKI). Most PKI implementations add the trusted root CAs to Windows clients. For example, using Active Directory Certificate Services with group policy. If you issue the server authentication certificate from a CA that your clients don't automatically trust, add the CA trusted root certificate to clients.

> [!TIP]
> The only clients that need to communicate with the recovery service are those clients that you plan to target with a BitLocker management policy and includes a **Client Management** rule.

On the client, use the **BitLockerManagementHandler.log** to troubleshoot this connection. For connectivity to the recovery service, the log shows the URL that the client is using. Locate an entry that starts with `Checking for Recovery Service at`.

> [!NOTE]
> If your site has more than one management point, enable HTTPS on all management points at the site with which a BitLocker-managed client could potentially communicate. If the HTTPS management point is unavailable, the client could fail over to an HTTP management point, and then fail to escrow its recovery key.
>
> This recommendation applies to both options: enable the management point for HTTPS, or enable the IIS website that hosts the recovery service on the management point.

### SQL encryption certificate

Use this certificate to enable SQL Server cell-level encryption of BitLocker recovery data. You can use your own process to create and deploy the BitLocker management encryption certificate, as long as it meets the following requirements:

- The name of the BitLocker management encryption certificate must be `BitLockerManagement_CERT`.

- Encrypt this certificate with a database master key.

- The following SQL users need **Control** permissions on the certificate:
  - RecoveryAndHardwareCore
  - RecoveryAndHardwareRead
  - RecoveryAndHardwareWrite

- Deploy the same certificate at every site database in your hierarchy.

- Create the certificate with the latest version of SQL Server in your environment. For example:
  - Certificates created with SQL Server 2016 or later are compatible with SQL Server 2014 or earlier.
  - Certificates created with SQL Server 2014 or earlier aren't compatible with SQL Server 2016 or later.

## Example scripts

These SQL scripts are examples to create and deploy a BitLocker management encryption certificate in the Configuration Manager site database.

### Create certificate

This sample script does the following actions:

- Creates a certificate
- Sets the permissions
- Creates a database master key

Before you use this script in a production environment, change the following values:

- Site database name (`CM_ABC`)
- Password to create the master key (`MyMasterKeyPassword`)
- Certificate expiry date (`20391022`)

``` SQL
USE CM_ABC
IF NOT EXISTS (SELECT name FROM sys.symmetric_keys WHERE name = '##MS_DatabaseMasterKey##')
BEGIN
    CREATE MASTER KEY ENCRYPTION BY PASSWORD = 'MyMasterKeyPassword'
END

IF NOT EXISTS (SELECT name from sys.certificates WHERE name = 'BitLockerManagement_CERT')
BEGIN
    CREATE CERTIFICATE BitLockerManagement_CERT AUTHORIZATION RecoveryAndHardwareCore
    WITH SUBJECT = 'BitLocker Management',
    EXPIRY_DATE = '20391022'

    GRANT CONTROL ON CERTIFICATE ::BitLockerManagement_CERT TO RecoveryAndHardwareRead
    GRANT CONTROL ON CERTIFICATE ::BitLockerManagement_CERT TO RecoveryAndHardwareWrite
END
```

### Back up certificate

This sample script backs up a certificate. When you save the certificate to a file, you can then [restore](#restore-certificate) it to other site databases in the hierarchy.

Before you use this script in a production environment, change the following values:

- Site database name (`CM_ABC`)
- File path and name (`C:\BitLockerManagement_CERT_KEY`)
- Export key password (`MyExportKeyPassword`)

``` SQL
USE CM_ABC
BACKUP CERTIFICATE BitLockerManagement_CERT TO FILE = 'C:\BitLockerManagement_CERT'
    WITH PRIVATE KEY ( FILE = 'C:\BitLockerManagement_CERT_KEY',
        ENCRYPTION BY PASSWORD = 'MyExportKeyPassword')
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Store the exported certificate file and associated password in a secure location.

### Restore certificate

This sample script restores a certificate from a file. Use this process to deploy a certificate that you created on another site database.

Before you use this script in a production environment, change the following values:

- Site database name (`CM_ABC`)
- Master key password (`MyMasterKeyPassword`)
- File path and name (`C:\BitLockerManagement_CERT_KEY`)
- Export key password (`MyExportKeyPassword`)

``` SQL
USE CM_ABC
IF NOT EXISTS (SELECT name FROM sys.symmetric_keys WHERE name = '##MS_DatabaseMasterKey##')
BEGIN
    CREATE MASTER KEY ENCRYPTION BY PASSWORD = 'MyMasterKeyPassword'
END

IF NOT EXISTS (SELECT name from sys.certificates WHERE name = 'BitLockerManagement_CERT')
BEGIN

CREATE CERTIFICATE BitLockerManagement_CERT AUTHORIZATION RecoveryAndHardwareCore
FROM FILE  = 'C:\BitLockerManagement_CERT'
    WITH PRIVATE KEY ( FILE = 'C:\BitLockerManagement_CERT_KEY',
        DECRYPTION BY PASSWORD = 'MyExportKeyPassword')

GRANT CONTROL ON CERTIFICATE ::BitLockerManagement_CERT TO RecoveryAndHardwareRead
GRANT CONTROL ON CERTIFICATE ::BitLockerManagement_CERT TO RecoveryAndHardwareWrite
END
```

### Verify certificate

Use this SQL script to verify that SQL successfully created the certificate with the required permissions.

``` SQL
USE CM_ABC
declare @count int
select @count = count(distinct u.name) from sys.database_principals u
join sys.database_permissions p on p.grantee_principal_id = u.principal_id or p.grantor_principal_id = u.principal_id
join sys.certificates c on c.certificate_id = p.major_id
where u.name in('RecoveryAndHardwareCore', 'RecoveryAndHardwareRead', 'RecoveryAndHardwareWrite') and
c.name = 'BitLockerManagement_CERT' and p.permission_name like 'CONTROL'
if(@count >= 3) select 1
else select 0
```

If the certificate is valid, the script returns a value of `1`.
