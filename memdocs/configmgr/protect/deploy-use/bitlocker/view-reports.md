# View BitLocker reports

*Applies to: Configuration Manager (current branch)*

<!--3601034-->

After you [install the reports](setup-websites.md) on the reporting services point, you can view the reports. The reports show BitLocker compliance for the enterprise and for individual devices. They provide tabular information and charts, and have filters that let you view data from different perspectives.

In the Configuration Manager console, go to the **Monitoring** workspace, expand **Reporting**, and select the **Reports** node. The following reports are in the **BitLocker Management** category:

- [BitLocker Computer Compliance](#bkmk-compliancereport)

- [BitLocker Enterprise Compliance Dashboard](#bkmk-dashboard)

- [BitLocker Enterprise Compliance Details](#bkmk-compliancedetails)

- [BitLocker Enterprise Compliance Summary](#bkmk-compliancesummary)

- [Recovery Audit Report](#bkmk-audit)

You can access all of these reports directly from the reporting services point website.

> [!NOTE]
> For these reports to display complete data:
>
> - Create and deploy a BitLocker management policy to a device collection
> - Clients in the target collection need to send hardware inventory

## <a name="bkmk-compliancereport"></a> BitLocker computer compliance

Use this report to collect information that's specific to a computer. It provides detailed encryption information about the OS drive and any fixed data drives. To view the details of each drive, expand the Computer Name entry. It also indicates the policy that's applied to each drive type on the computer.

You can also use this report to determine the last known BitLocker encryption status of lost or stolen computers. Configuration Manager determines compliance of the device based on the BitLocker policies that you deploy. Before you try to determine the BitLocker encryption state of a device, verify the policies that you've deployed to it.

> [!NOTE]
> This report doesn't show the Removable Data Volume encryption status.

## <a name="bkmk-dashboard"></a> BitLocker enterprise compliance dashboard

This report provides the following graphs, which show BitLocker compliance status across your organization:

- Compliance status distribution

- Non-compliant - Errors distribution

- Compliance status distribution by drive type

:::image type="content" source="media/bitlocker-enterprise-compliance-dashboard.png" alt-text="Example screenshot of BitLocker enterprise compliance dashboard" lightbox="media/bitlocker-enterprise-compliance-dashboard.png":::

### Compliance status distribution

This pie chart shows compliance status for computers in the organization. It also shows the percentage of computers with that compliance status, compared to the total number of computers in the selected collection. The actual number of computers with each status is also shown.

The pie chart shows the following compliance statuses:

- Compliant

- Non-compliant

- User exempt

- Temporary user exempt

- Policy not enforced

- Unknown. These computers reported a status error, or they're part of the collection but have never reported their compliance status. The lack of a compliance status could occur if the computer is disconnected from the organization.

### Non-compliant - Errors distribution

This pie chart shows the categories of computers in your organization that aren't compliant with the BitLocker Drive Encryption policy. It also shows the number of computers in each category. The report calculates each percentage from the total number of non-compliant computers in the collection.

- User postponed encryption

- Unable to find compatible TPM

- System partition not available or large enough

- TPM visible but not initialized

- Policy conflict

- Waiting for TPM auto provisioning

- An unknown error has occurred

- No information. These computers don't have the BitLocker management agent installed, or it's installed but not activated. For example, the service isn't working.

### Compliance status distribution by drive type

This bar chart shows the current BitLocker compliance status by drive type. The statuses are **Compliant** and **Non-compliant**. Bars are shown for fixed data drives and OS drives. The report includes computers without a fixed data drive, and only shows a value in the **Operating System Drive** bar. The chart doesn't include users who have been granted an exemption from the BitLocker Drive Encryption policy or the No Policy category.

## <a name="bkmk-audit"></a> Recovery audit report

> [!NOTE]
> Starting in version 2002, this report is only available from the [BitLocker administration and monitoring website](helpdesk-portal.md#reports).<!-- 7629549 -->

Use this report to audit users who have requested access to BitLocker recovery keys. You can filter on the following criteria:

- A specific type of user, for example, a help desk user or an end user
- If the request failed or was successful
- The specific type of key requested: Recovery Key Password, Recovery Key ID, or TPM Password Hash
- A date range during which the retrieval occurred

:::image type="content" source="media/bitlocker-recovery-audit-report.png" alt-text="Example screenshot of BitLocker Recovery audit report" lightbox="media/bitlocker-recovery-audit-report.png":::

|Column&nbsp;name|Description|
|----------------|----|
|Request date and time|Date and time that an end user or help desk user requested a key.|
|Audit request source|The site from where the request came. Valid values are **Self-Service Portal** or **Helpdesk**.|
|Request result|Status of the request. Valid values are **Successful** or **Failed**.|
|Helpdesk user|The administrative user who requested the key. If a helpdesk admin recovers the key without specifying the user name, the **End User** field is blank. A standard helpdesk user must specify the user name, which appears in this field. For recovery via the self-service portal, this field and the **End User** field display the name of the user making the request.|
|End user|Name of the user who requested key retrieval.|
|Computer|Name of the computer that was recovered.|
|Key type|Type of key that the user requested. The three types of keys are:<br/><br/>- **Recovery key password**: used to recover a computer in recovery mode<br/>- **Recovery key ID**: used to recover a computer in recovery mode for another user<br/>- **TPM password hash**: used to recover a computer with a locked TPM|
|Reason description|Why the user requested the specified key type, based upon the option they selected in the form.|
