# Microsoft Defender for Endpoint

*Applies to: Configuration Manager (current branch)*

Endpoint Protection can help manage and monitor [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint](/windows/security/threat-protection/microsoft-defender-atp/microsoft-defender-advanced-threat-protection). Microsoft Defender for Endpoint helps enterprises detect, investigate, and respond to advanced attacks on their networks. Configuration Manager policies can help you onboard and monitor Windows 10 or later clients.

Microsoft Defender for Endpoint's cloud-based portal is [Microsoft Defender Security Center](https://securitycenter.windows.com). By adding and deploying a client onboarding configuration file, Configuration Manager can monitor deployment status and Microsoft Defender for Endpoint agent health. Microsoft Defender for Endpoint is supported on PCs running the Configuration Manager client or [managed by Microsoft Intune](/mem/intune/protect/advanced-threat-protection).

## Prerequisites

- Subscription to Microsoft Defender for Endpoint
- Clients computers running the Configuration Manager client
- Clients using an OS listed in the [supported client operating systems](#bkmk_os) section below.
- Your administrative user account needs the **Endpoint Protection Manager** security role.<!-- MEMDocs#698 -->

### <a name="bkmk_os"></a> Supported client operating systems

<!--5229962-->
You can onboard the following operating systems using Configuration Manager:

- Windows 11
- Windows 10, version  1709 or newer
- Windows 8.1
- Windows Server 2022
- Windows Server 2019
- Windows Server Semi-Annual Channel (SAC), version 1803 or newer
- Windows Server 2016

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Operating systems that have reached the end of their [product lifecycle](/lifecycle/faq/general-lifecycle) aren't typically supported for onboarding unless they have been enrolled into the [Extended Security Updates (ESU program)](/lifecycle/faq/extended-security-updates). For more information about supported operating systems and capabilities with Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, see [Minimum requirements for Microsoft Defender for Endpoint](/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/minimum-requirements#supported-windows-versions). <!-- MAX 6198973-->

Instructions to [Onboarding to Microsoft Defender for Endpoint with Configuration Manager 2207 and later versions](#bkmk_2207)

Instructions to [Updating onboarding information for Microsoft Defender for Endpoint devices with Configuration Manager](#bkmk_updateatp)

## <a name="bkmk_2207"></a> Onboarding to Microsoft Defender for Endpoint with Configuration Manager 2207 and later versions

Different operating systems have different needs for onboarding to Microsoft Defender for Endpoint. Up-level devices, such as Windows Server version 1803, need the onboarding configuration file. Starting Current Branch 2207, For down-level server operating system devices, you can choose between Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (MDE) Client (recommended) or Microsoft Monitoring Agent (MMA) (legacy) in the Client Settings. For Windows 8.1 devices, you need to use Microsoft Monitoring Agent (MMA) (legacy) in the Client Settings.

If you choose to use MMA, you need the **Workspace key** and **Workspace ID** to onboard. Configuration Manager also installs the Microsoft Monitoring Agent (MMA) when needed by onboarded devices but it doesn't update the agent automatically.

Up-level operating systems include:
- Windows 10, version 1607 and later
- Windows 11
- Windows Server Semi-Annual Channel (SAC), version 1803 or later
- Windows Server 2019
- Windows Server 2022

Down-level operating systems that support MDE Client include:
- Windows Server 2012 R2
- Windows Server 2016

Down-level operating systems that require MMA Agent:
- Windows 8.1

> [!NOTE]
> Currently, the [modern, unified Microsoft Defender for Endpoint for Windows Server 2012 R2 & 2016](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-defender-for-endpoint/defending-windows-server-2012-r2-and-2016/bc-p/2904464) is generally available. Configuration Manager version 2107 with the update rollup supports configuration using Endpoint Protection policies, including those policies created in the Microsoft Intune admin center using tenant attach. Configuration Manager version 2207 now supports automatic deployment of MDE Client, if you choose to use through Client Settings. For older supported versions, see [Server migration scenarios](/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/server-migration).

When you onboard devices to Microsoft Defender for Endpoint with Configuration Manager, you deploy the Defender policy to a target collection or multiple collections. Sometimes the target collection contains devices running any number of the supported operating systems. The instructions for onboarding these devices vary based on if you're targeting a collection containing devices with operating systems that are only up-level and devices that support MDE Client or if the collection also includes down-level clients that require MMA.

- If your collection contains only up-level devices and/or down-level server operating system devices that require MDE Client (based on the client settings), then you can use the [onboarding instructions using Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Client](#bkmk_2207_uplevel) (recommended).
- If your target collection contains down-level server operating system devices that require MMA (based on the client settings) or Windows 8.1 devices, then use the instructions to [onboard devices using Microsoft Monitoring Agent](#bkmk_2207_any_os).

> [!WARNING]
> If your target collection contains down-level devices that require MMA, and you use the instructions for onboarding using MDE Client, then the down-level devices won't be onboarded. The optional **Workspace key** and **Workspace ID** fields are used for onboarding down-level devices that require MMA, but if they aren't included then the policy will fail on down-level clients that require MMA.


### <a name="bkmk_2207_uplevel"></a> Onboard devices using MDE Client to Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (recommended)

## <a name="bkmk_updateatp"></a> Updating the onboarding information for existing devices

Organizations may need to update the onboarding information on a device via Microsoft Configuration Manager.

This can be necessary due to a change in the onboarding payload for Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, or when directed by Microsoft support.

Updating the onboarding information will direct the device to start utilizing the new onboarding payload at the next *Restart*.

This process compromises of actions to update the existing onboarding policy, and executing a one time action on all existing devices to update the onboarding payload. Utilize the **Group Policy** onboarding script to perform a one time uplift of devices from the old payload to the new payload.

> [!NOTE]
> This information will not necessarily move a device between tenants without fully offboarding the device from the original tenant. For options migrating devices between Microsoft Defender for Endpoint organizations, engage Microsoft Support.

### Validate the new onboarding payload

1. Download the **Group Policy** onboarding package from the Microsoft Defender for Endpoint portal.

1. **Create** a collection for validation of the new onboarding payload

1. **Exclude** this collection from the existing Microsoft Defender for Endpoint collection targeted with the onboarding payload.

1. **Deploy** the **Group Policy** onboarding script to the test collection.

1. **Validate** the devices are utilizing the new onboarding payload.

### Migrate to the new onboarding payload

1. Download the **Microsoft Configuration Manager** onboarding package from the Microsoft Defender for Endpoint portal.

1. **Update** the existing Microsoft Defender for Endpoint onboarding policy with the new onboarding payload.

1. **Deploy** the script from [Validate the new onboarding payload](./defender-advanced-threat-protection.md#validate-the-new-onboarding-payload) to the existing target collection for the Microsoft Defender for Endpoint onboarding policy.

1. **Validate** the devices are utilizing the new onboarding payload and successfully consuming the payload from the script

> [!NOTE]
> Once all devices are migrated you can remove the script and validation collections from your environment, using the onboarding policy moving forward.
