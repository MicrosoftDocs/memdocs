# Available third-party software update catalogs

*Applies to: Configuration Manager (current branch)*

The **Third-Party Software Update Catalogs** node in the Configuration Manager console allows you to subscribe to third-party catalogs, publish their updates to your software update point (SUP), and then deploy them to clients. You can [add custom catalogs](third-party-software-updates.md#add-a-custom-catalog) from third-party vendors. 

## Third-party update catalogs available for import
<!--9989251-->
To make it easier to find custom catalogs, we're providing a list of links as a convenience. Some catalogs are freely available and some catalogs have an additional cost associated with them. This list includes catalogs that may only work with [System Center Updates Publisher](../tools/updates-publisher.md) and not the **Third-Party Software Update Catalogs** node in the Configuration Manager console. Check with the catalog provider for details including pricing, support, and if the catalog supports in-console third-party updates.
