# Monitor operating system deployments in Configuration Manager

*Applies to: Configuration Manager (current branch)*

The Configuration Manager console provides the following ways to help you monitor operating system deployment objects.  


##  <a name="BKMK_OSDAlerts"></a> Alerts for operating system deployments  
 You can configure an alert in the task sequence  deployment settings to notify administrative users when compliance levels for the  deployment is below the configured percentage.  

 After you configure the alert settings, if the specified conditions occur, Configuration Manager generates an alert. You can review task sequence deployment alerts at the following locations:  

1.  Review recent alerts in the **Operating Systems** node in the **Software Library** workspace.  

2.  Manage the configured alerts in the **Alerts** node in the **Monitoring** workspace.  

##  <a name="BKMK_TSDeployStatus"></a> Task sequence deployment status  
 After you deploy a task sequence, you can monitor the deployment status. Use the following procedure to monitor the deployment status for a task sequence.  

#### To monitor deployment status  

1.  In the Configuration Manager console, click **Monitoring**.  

2.  In the Monitoring workspace, click **Deployments**.  

3.  Click the task sequence  for which you want to monitor the deployment status.

##  <a name="BKMK_TSReports"></a> Operating system deployment reports  
 There are many predefined operating system deployment reports available. They are organized in several categories and can be used to report on specific information about state migration and task sequence deployments. In addition to using the preconfigured reports, you can also create custom software update reports according to the needs of your enterprise. For more information, see [Operations and maintenance for reporting](../../core/servers/manage/operations-and-maintenance-for-reporting.md).  

##  <a name="BKMK_MonitorContent"></a> Monitor content  
 You can monitor content in the Configuration Manager console to review the status for all package types in relation to the associated distribution points. This can include the content validation status for the content in the package, the status of content assigned to a specific distribution point group, the state of content assigned to a distribution point, and the status of optional features for each distribution point (content validation, PXE, and multicast).  

###  <a name="BKMK_ContentStatus"></a> Content status monitoring
