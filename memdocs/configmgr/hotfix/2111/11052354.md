## Summary of KB11052354
Release version 2111 of Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager current branch contains fixes and feature improvements.

## Issues that are fixed
<!-- 6014443 -->
- The secondary site upgrade process may fail if the maximum SQL Express database size (10GB) is exceeded due to replication of unnecessary data.

<!-- 8770341, 10874715 -->
- Installation of BitLocker management portals fails under either of the following conditions.
   1. A localized non-English version of SQL Server Reporting Services is installed on the site server.
   2. SQL Server and SQL Server Reporting Services are installed on a remote server and running under the context of a domain service account.

<!-- 9462655 -->
- Client push installation fails under the following conditions.
   - The Allow connection fallback to NTLM option is not selected in Client Push Installation properties.
   - The site server machine account is not in the local admin group on the client.
   - The Restrict NTLM: Incoming NTLM traffic group policy is set to Deny all domain accounts.

Under these conditions, client push fails with errors resembling the following in the ccm.log file.
   ```text
   Unable to connect to remote machine "{Client_name}" using Kerberos with machine account, error - 0x80070005
   ```

<!-- 9559973 -->
- The download of installation files by CCMSetup is now randomized across available distribution points within a boundary group.

<!-- 9578895, 9578899 -->
- Orchestration group post-installation scripts may run prior to a computer reboot, causing unexpected results during deployments. After the computer reboot, the scripts may not run until the next maintenance window.

<!-- 9763593 -->
- In large environments the process of uploading Endpoint Analytics data may block database reindexing tasks, leading to further performance issues. 

<!-- 9838506 -->
- State message processing may fail when the messages contain failure codes for Windows Feature Updates, such as error 0xC1900208. When this happens errors resembling the following are recorded in the statesys.log file.
   ```text
   SQL MESSAGE: spProcessStateReport - Error: Record 1 returned an 'invalid record' return code and failed processing with error 8114: ERROR 8114, Level 16, State 5, Procedure spProcessSUMEnforcementMsg, Line 5, Message: Error converting data type nvarchar to bigint.
   ```

<!-- 9975366 -->
- The **Endpoint Protection and software updates compliance - Historical** report can contain inaccurate data where compliant devices are recorded as non-compliant.

<!-- 10041469 -->
- The issue described in the following article could still happen if the management point was unable to process a client discovery data record (DDR); this is now fully resolved.

    [A client computer can steal the Configuration Manager GUID of an Unknown Computer object during imaging](/troubleshoot/mem/configmgr/unknown-computer-object-guid-stolen)
 
<!-- 10415702 -->
- The Active Directory Forest Discovery method fails if it receives a "The server is not operational" exception during the discovery process, leading to incomplete discovery results. An error resembling the following is recorded in the ADForestDisc.log file.
   ```text
   ERROR: [ForestDiscoveryAgent]: Discovery is being aborted due to an unexpected exception.
   ```

<!-- 10422235 -->
- The availability of a service window is incorrectly checked when a dependent/ nested task sequence runs for a user. This leads to application deployment failures if a computer restart happens after the initial top-level task sequence runs.

<!-- 10520849 -->
- Full database reinitialization may happen for a primary site during the update process because of a timing issue.

<!-- 10526961 -->
- The management point role fails to install on a server if the Visual C++ runtime is newer than version 14.28.

<!-- 11121626 -->

<!-- 11862459 -->
- The client registration process for Microsoft Entra joined clients is improved to increase efficiency and reduce the likelihood of state message processing backlogs.

<!-- 8881094 -->
- Logging associated with state message processing is improved to include filenames by default, improving the ability to troubleshoot processing issues.

<!-- 9714050 -->

The connection error typically happens when trying to open a property window from a list view in the console but could also happen in other scenarios. Errors may include variations on any of the following:
   - Microsoft.ConfigurationManagement.ManagementProvider.SmsConnectionException
   The object invoked has disconnected from its clients. (Exception from HRESULT: 0x80010108 (RPC_E_DISCONNECTED))

   Microsoft.ConfigurationManagement.ManagementProvider.SmsConnectionException

   - Microsoft.ConfigurationManagement.ManagementProvider.SmsMultipleResultException
   Failed to update one or more result object(s)
