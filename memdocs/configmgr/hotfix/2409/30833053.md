# Cloud management gateway installation update for Configuration Manager 2409

*Applies to: Configuration Manager (current branch, version 2409)*

## Summary of KB30833053
<!-- 30833053 -->
New cloud management gateways (CMGs) fail to install after updating to Configuration Manager version 2409. The following error is recorded in the CloudMgr.log file:
   ```text
   ERROR: Exception occured for service <ServiceName> : System.AggregateException: One or more errors occurred.
   ---> Azure.RequestFailedException: At least one resource deployment operation failed. Please list deployment operations for details. Please see https://aka.ms/arm-deployment-operations for usage details.~~Status: 200 (OK)~~ErrorCode: DeploymentFailed~~~~Service request succeeded. Response content and headers are not included to avoid logging sensitive data.
   ```

The Azure activity logs for Virtual Machine Scale Sets or the Resource group have more detail.
   ```text
   "statusMessage": "{\"status\":\"Failed\",\"error\":{\"code\":\"ResourceOperationFailure\",\"message\":\"The resource operation completed with terminal provisioning state 'Failed'.\",\"details\":[{\"code\":\"VMExtensionProvisioningError\",\"target\":\"0\",\"message\":\"VM has reported a failure when processing extension 'InstallCMG' (publisher 'Microsoft.Compute' and type 'CustomScriptExtension'). Error message: 'Command execution finished, but failed because it returned a non-zero exit code of: '1''. More information on troubleshooting is available at https://aka.ms/VMExtensionCSEWindowsTroubleshoot. \"}]}}"
   ```

### Update information for Microsoft Configuration Manager current branch, version 2409

This update is available in the Updates and Servicing node of the Configuration Manager console for version 2409 environments.

### Restart information

This update doesn't require a computer restart or a [site reset](../../core/servers/manage/modify-your-infrastructure.md#bkmk_reset) after installation.

### Additional installation information

After you install this update on a primary site, preexisting secondary sites must be manually updated. To update a secondary site in the Configuration Manager console, select **Administration** > **Site Configuration** > **Sites** >  **Recover Secondary Site**, and then select the secondary site. The primary site then reinstalls that secondary site by using the updated files. This reinstallation doesn't affect configurations and settings for the secondary site. The new, upgraded, and reinstalled secondary sites under that primary site automatically receive this update.

Run the following SQL Server command on the site database to check whether the update version of a secondary site matches that of its parent primary site:
   ```sql
   select dbo.fnGetSecondarySiteCMUpdateStatus ('SiteCode_of_secondary_site')
   ```
If the value 1 is returned, the site is up to date, with all the hotfixes applied on its parent primary site.

If the value 0 is returned, all the fixes that are applied to the primary site aren't installed for the secondary site. You should use the **Recover Secondary Site** option to update the secondary site.
