   KB [21010486](../../hotfix/2303/21010486.md): Update rollup for Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager current branch, version 2303

## Issues that are fixed
<!-- 3013243 -->
- The status for all site system roles shows as Critical after recovering a site to a different drive letter from the original installation.

<!-- 12874521 -->
- Discovery and remediation scripts of a previously deleted baseline might still run on a client when an existing baseline is evaluated. 

<!-- 16225207 -->
- Memory management in the Configuration Manager console is improved to address virtual memory beyond the 2-GB range.

<!-- 16235012, 24435111  -->
- The *Summary* chart for an App deployment in the *Deployments* node of the console isn't consistent with the counts displayed for that deployment.

<!-- 17436872 -->
- The synchronization of collection members to Microsoft Entra groups might stop unexpectedly. SQL tracing shows an error message similar to the following text:
   ```text
   Violation of PRIMARY KEY constraint 'CollectionAADGroupMember_PK'. Cannot insert duplicate key in object 'dbo.CollectionAADGroupMember'. The duplicate key value is (e54a38c8-9c00-46d7-861f-5e2153200df9, 16777219, a2073376-4d1b-45bd-b1e8-0a0d0f6151ee).
   ```

<!-- 17776096 -->
- The network adapters on Modern Standby capable devices might wake up unexpectedly and generate DHCP requests, although the device itself doesn't wake. This happens when the *Allow Network wake-up* client setting is enabled. Beginning with version 2309, the *Reduce network packets for Modern Standby devices* client setting is available to prevent this behavior. See [Reduce network packets for Modern Standby devices](../../core/clients/deploy/about-client-settings.md#reduce-network-packets-for-modern-standby-devices) for more information.

<!-- 24766267 -->
- Content location requests sent from a client fails if there's an apostrophe in the client's network adapter or active directory site name.

<!-- 9217349 -->
- The **Windows Defender Exploit Guard Attack Surface Reduction** rule applicability check for Windows Server incorrectly marks servers as compliant without any enforcement.

<!-- 15855196 -->
- Data from Active Directory Group Discovery supersedes and overwrites data from Microsoft Entra group Discovery. This leads to inconsistent collection membership and query results.

<!-- 6167745, 2839966 -->
The following features first introduced in Technical Preview version 2305 are now available in the Configuration Manager console.
- The **Delete Aged Task Execution Status Messages** maintenance task.
- The **Enable Preferred Management Point(s) for PXE requests** option. 
- Escrowing a recovery key to the Configuration Manager database is now supported using ProvisionTS.
- The client certificate state in console (self-signed) now matches the state in control panel (PKI).

For more information, see [Features in Configuration Manager technical preview version 2305](../../core/get-started/2023/technical-preview-2305.md).
