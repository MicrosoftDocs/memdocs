# How to use the Package Conversion Manager plug-in

*Applies to: Configuration Manager (current branch)*

<!--1357861-->

The Package Conversion Manager plug-in helps you customize the analysis and conversion processes. To use the Package Conversion Manager plug-in, write an executable or script file that performs custom operations. Then edit the configuration file, Microsoft.ConfigurationManagement.exe.config, to call the executable or script. The most common languages used to write the script are VBScript or PowerShell.

The Package Conversion Manager plug-in runs once for each package. If you analyze or convert multiple packages at one time, the Package Conversion Manager plug-in runs each time.

> [!NOTE]  
> For more information on the Package Conversion Manager elements in the Configuration Manager configuration file, see [Technical reference for the Package Conversion Manager plug-in configuration XML](plugin-config-xml.md).
