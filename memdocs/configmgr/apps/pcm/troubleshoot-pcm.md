# Troubleshoot Package Conversion Manager

*Applies to: Configuration Manager (current branch)*

<!--1357861-->

Use the information in this article to help you troubleshoot problems when using Package Conversion Manager.



## SMS Provider

Package Conversion Manager uses the SMS Provider. For more information, see [Plan for the SMS Provider](../../core/plan-design/hierarchy/plan-for-the-sms-provider.md).

If the SMS Provider isn't working properly, the Configuration Manager console including the Package Conversion Manager doesn't work.



## Package readiness

Before converting a package to an application, analyze the package using the Package Conversion Manager **Analyze** function. After the analysis, add the **Readiness** column in the **Packages** node of the Configuration Manager console. The list of packages displays one of the following readiness states of the analyzed package:

- **Automatic**: The package can be directly converted using the **Convert** function.      

  > [!NOTE]  
  > An automatic conversion doesn't convert WQL queries into application requirements. Use the **Fix and Convert** process to convert these queries.  

- **Manual**: The package needs some additions or changes before you can convert it using the **Fix and Convert** function.  

- **Not Applicable**: The package isn't suitable for conversion. Either correct any problems with the package, or continue to deploy it as a package.  

- **Error**: The package contains errors. Manually correct these errors before you can analyze and convert it.  

The details pane of the **Packages** node in the Configuration Manager console shows any readiness issues. Select a package, and then select the **Summary** tab in the details pane.



## Log files

### Enable logging

When you enable logging for Package Conversion Manager, it logs all of its actions, exceptions, and errors. 

To enable logging for this component in the Configuration Manager, modify **Microsoft.ConfigurationManagement.exe.Config**. By default, this configuration file is located in the following path:  
`C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Configuration Manager\AdminConsole\bin\Microsoft.ConfigurationManagement.exe.config`  

Insert the following **switches** and **trace** XML elements in the **system.diagnostics** element after the last **sources** element:

``` XML
</sources>

    <switches>
      <add name="PcmLogging" value="3"/>
    </switches>
    <trace autoflush="true" indentsize="4">
      <listeners>
        <add name="PcmTraceListener" type="Microsoft.ConfigurationManagement.UserCentric.Logging.RolloverLogTraceListener, Microsoft.ConfigurationManagement.UserCentric.Logging" initializeData="%UserProfile%\AppData\Local\Temp\PcmTrace.log"/>
      </listeners>
    </trace>

</system.diagnostics>
```

This sample uses the file **PCMTrace.log**. This log is on the computer running the Configuration Manager console in the following path:  
`%UserProfile%\AppData\Local\Temp`

To configure the level of detail, change the **PcmLogging** trace switch setting. Set the this value to four levels of detail, from least detailed (`1`) to most detailed (`4`).


### SMSProv.log

In some situations, information relevant to troubleshooting the package conversion process is in the **SMSProv.log** file. This file captures information from the Configuration Manager SMS Provider.

By default, this log file is located on the Configuration Manager site server at the following path:  
`C:\Program Files\Microsoft Configuration Manager\Logs`

If you see one of the following error messages, the **SMSProv.log** file may contain relevant troubleshooting information:

- `The SMS Provider reported an error`

- `Generic Failure`

These error messages typically indicate that an error occurred on the site server, and that the error information wasn't sent to the Configuration Manager console.

For more information, see [Technical reference for Package Conversion Manager error messages](error-messages.md).



## Changing package attributes after analysis

After you analyze a package and it has a readiness state of **Automatic** or **Manual**, the conversion process might fail if you change any of the relevant attributes.

For example, you analyze a package and its readiness state is **Automatic**. Then you add another program to the package. The package conversion might fail.

If you need to make changes to a package after analysis, rerun analysis before conversion.
