# Monitor applications from the Configuration Manager console

*Applies to: Configuration Manager (current branch)*

Applications in Configuration Manager support state-based monitoring, which enables you to track the last application deployment state for users and devices. These state messages display information about individual devices. For example, if an application is deployed to a collection of users, you can view the compliance state of the deployment and the deployment purpose in the Configuration Manager console.

Monitor application deployments by using the **Monitoring** workspace in the Configuration Manager console or by using reports.

## About compliance states

An application deployment state has one of the following compliance states:

- **Success**: The client successfully deployed the application or it's already deployed. A deployment can install or uninstall an application.

- **In progress**: The client is currently running the application deployment.

- **Unknown**: Configuration Manager can't determine the state of the application deployment. This state isn't applicable for deployments with a purpose of **Available**. The console typically displays this state when the site hasn't yet received state messages from the client.

- **Requirements not met**: The client didn't run the application deployment because it wasn't compliant with a dependency or a requirement rule. For example, the OS on the device isn't applicable.

- **Error**: The client failed to deploy the application because of an error.

For each compliance state, you can view additional information, such as the number of users and devices in this category. The compliance states also include subcategories. For example, the **Error** compliance state includes the following subcategories:

- Error evaluating requirements

- Content related errors

- Installation errors

When more than one compliance state applies for an application deployment, you can see the aggregate state that represents the lowest compliance. For example:

- A user signs in to two devices. The application successfully installs on one device but fails to install on the other. The aggregate deployment state of the application for this user displays as **Error**.

- You deploy an application to all users that sign in to a computer. Configuration Manager displays multiple deployment results for that computer. If one of the deployments fails, the aggregate deployment state for the computer displays as **Error**.

Use these subcategories to help you to quickly identify any important issues with an application deployment. You can also view additional information about the devices that fall into a particular subcategory of a compliance state.

## Application monitoring reports

Application management in Configuration Manager includes many built-in reports to monitor information about applications and deployments. These reports have the report category of **Software Distribution â€“ Application Monitoring**. For more information, see [List of reports](../../core/servers/manage/list-of-reports.md#software-distribution---application-monitoring).

For more information about how to configure reporting in Configuration Manager, see [Introduction to reporting](../../core/servers/manage/introduction-to-reporting.md).

## Monitor app state in the console

1. In the Configuration Manager console, go to the **Monitoring** workspace, and select the **Deployments** node.

    > [!TIP]
    > If your site has a lot of deployments, filter the list to just application deployments.
    >
    > 1. At the top of the list next to the _Search_ field, select **Add Criteria**. Choose **Feature Type** and then select **Add**.
    > 1. The search area adds the default criteria, **AND Feature Type Content Distribution**. Select **Content Distribution** and choose **Application** instead.
    > 1. Select **Search** to refresh the list.

1. Select a deployment for the app to monitor.

- To review general status information about an application deployment, see the **Summary** tab in the details pane.

- To review status for the application's deployment types, switch to the **Deployment Types** tab in the details pane.

- To review deployment details for each compliance state and the resources in that state, select **View status** on the **Home** tab of the ribbon. This action opens the **Deployment Status** pane. Here you can view the assets in each compliance state. To view more detailed information about the deployment status to an asset, select it in the Asset Details list. Then select **More Details** on the right side of the window.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The maximum number of items that the **Deployment Status** pane can display is 20,000. If you need to see more items, use Configuration Manager reports to view application status data.
    >
    > The status of deployment types is aggregated in the **Deployment Status** pane. To view more detailed information about the deployment types, use the **Application Infrastructure Errors** report.

### Summarized data

The information on the **Summary** and **Deployment Types** tabs is summarized data. When you select **View Status**, the console displays current data from the site database. If these data don't match, select **Run Summarization**.

To configure the default application deployment summarization interval:

1. In the Configuration Manager console, go to the **Administration** workspace, expand **Site Configuration**, and select the **Sites** node.

1. Select the site for which you want to configure the summarization interval. Then in the **Settings** group of the ribbon, choose **Status Summarizers**.

1. Select **Application Deployment Summarizer**, and the select **Edit**.

1. Configure the summarization intervals:

    - **Frequency of status updates for a deployment that was modified in the last 30 days**: By default, this value is **60 minutes**.
    - **Frequency of status updates for a deployment that was modified in the last 31 to 90 days**: By default, this value is **24 hours**.
    - **Frequency of status updates for a deployment that was last modified over 90 days ago**: By default this value is **7 days**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > These values apply to application, task sequence, and package deployments.
    >
    > The site calculates the period of time based on the deployment start time.
