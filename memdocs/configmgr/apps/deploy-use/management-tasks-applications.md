# Management tasks for Configuration Manager applications

*Applies to: Configuration Manager (current branch)*

Use the information in this article to help you manage Configuration Manager applications and deployment types.  

For help creating applications and deployment types, see [Create applications](../../apps/deploy-use/create-applications.md).  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  Depending on the type of application or deployment type, some management options might not be available.  

##  Manage applications  
 In the **Software Library** workspace, expand **Application Management** > **Applications**, choose the application to manage, and then choose a management task.  

|Task|Details|  
|----------|-------------|  
|**Manage Access Accounts**|Opens the **Manage Access Accounts** dialog box where you can specify the level of access that is allowed for the content that is associated with the selected application.|  
|**Create Prestage Content File**|Opens the **Create Prestaged Content File Wizard** that helps you to manage the distribution of content to remote distribution points. When the scheduling and throttling does not provide a valid solution for the remote distribution point, you can prestage the content on the distribution point<br /><br /> See [Manage content and content infrastructure](../../core/servers/deploy/configure/manage-content-and-content-infrastructure.md).|  
|**Revision History**|Opens the **Application Revision History** dialog box that lets you view the properties of revisions that were made to this application, delete old application revisions, and restore old versions of this application.<br /><br /> See [How to revise and supersede applications](../../apps/deploy-use/revise-and-supersede-applications.md).|  
|**Create Deployment Type**|Opens the **Create Deployment Type Wizard** that lets you add a new deployment type to the selected application.<br /><br /> See [Create applications](../../apps/deploy-use/create-applications.md).|  
|**Update Statistics**|Updates the information that is displayed in the **Deployments** node of the **Monitoring** workspace about the deployments of this application.<br /><br /> See [Monitor applications from the Configuration Manager console](../../apps/deploy-use/monitor-applications-from-the-console.md).|  
|**Reinstate**|Reinstates an application that was retired by using the **Retire** management task.|  
|**Retire**|When you retire an application, it is no longer available for deployment, but the application and deployments of the application are not deleted. Existing copies of this application that were installed on client computers will not be removed. Any revisions to the application will be deleted from Configuration Manager after 60 days. But, installed copies of the application are not removed.<br /><br /> To delete an application, you must first retire the application, delete all deployments, remove references to the application by other deployments, and then delete all of the application's revisions.<br /><br /> See [Revise and supersede applications](../../apps/deploy-use/revise-and-supersede-applications.md).|  
|**Export**|Opens the **Export Application Wizard** that lets you export the selected applications to a .zip file that you can then archive or install on another site. If you choose to export application content, a folder that has the content will be created.<br /><br /> You can also export application dependencies, supersedence relationships and conditions, and content for the application and its dependencies.<br /><br /> The Windows PowerShell cmdlet, **Export-CMApplication**, does the same function. For more information, see [Export-CMApplication](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=258880) in the Microsoft System Center 2012 Configuration Manager SP1 cmdlet reference documentation.|  
|**Delete**|Deletes the currently selected application.<br /><br /> You cannot delete an application if other applications are dependent on it, if it has an active deployment, or if it has dependent task sequences.|  
|**Simulate Deployment**|Opens the **Simulate Application Deployment Wizard** where you can test the results of an application deployment to computers without installing or uninstalling the application.<br /><br /> See [Simulate application deployments](../../apps/deploy-use/simulate-application-deployments.md).|  
|**Deploy**|Opens the **Deploy Software Wizard** where you can deploy the selected application to collections of computers in your hierarchy.<br /><br /> See [Deploy applications](../../apps/deploy-use/deploy-applications.md).|  
|**Distribute Content**|Opens the **Distribute Content Wizard** where you can copy the content for the selected application to distribution points in your hierarchy.<br /><br /> See [Manage content and content infrastructure](../../core/servers/deploy/configure/manage-content-and-content-infrastructure.md).|  
|**View Relationships**|Shows a graphical diagram of the relationships of the selected applications to other applications. Choose from one of the following:<br><br><ul><li>**Dependency** – Shows   applications that are dependent on the selected application and the applications that the selected application depends on.</li><li>**Supersedence** – Shows applications that the selected application supersedes and applications that the selected application is superseded by.</li><li>**Global Conditions** – Shows the global conditions that are referenced by this application.</li></ol><br /> See [Revise and supersede applications](../../apps/deploy-use/revise-and-supersede-applications.md) and [Create global conditions](../../apps/deploy-use/create-global-conditions.md).|  
|**Copy Applications**|Copy, or duplicate, Configuration Manager applications to create a new one. This action is useful to test something or when you need to create a similar application. The site creates a new application, with **-copy** appended to the name. While the site copies most of the metadata to the new application, it doesn't copy any deployments.|

##  Manage deployment types  
 In the **Software Library** workspace, expand **Application Management**, choose **Applications**, and then choose the application that has the deployment type that you want to manage. In the details pane, choose the **Deployment Types** tab, choose the deployment type that you want to manage, and then choose a management task.  

|Task|Details|  
|----------|-------------|  
|**Increase Priority**|Increases the priority of the selected deployment type. Deployment types are evaluated in order. When a deployment type meets the specified requirements, it will be run, and then no further deployment types on the priority list will be evaluated.|  
|**Decrease Priority**|Decreases the priority of the selected deployment type.|  
|**Delete**|Deletes the selected deployment type.<br><br>You cannot delete a deployment type if it is referenced by a deployment type in another application.<br>To delete a deployment type, you must remove all dependencies to the deployment type that are in other deployment types.<br>Additionally, you must also remove previous revisions of all applications that have a deployment type that references the deployment type that you want to delete.|  
|**Update Content**|Refreshes the content for the selected deployment type.<br /><br /> When you start this wizard for a deployment type that has a virtual application, the **Update Content Wizard** is started. This wizard lets you change publishing options and requirement rules for the selected virtual application. For more information, see [Create applications](../../apps/deploy-use/create-applications.md).<br /><br /> When you refresh the content of a deployment type, a new revision of the application is created. This might cause client devices to be updated with the new application.|
