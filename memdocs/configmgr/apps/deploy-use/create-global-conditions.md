# How to create global conditions in Configuration Manager

*Applies to: Configuration Manager (current branch)*

In Configuration Manager, global conditions are rules that represent business or technical conditions that you can use to specify how an application is provided and deployed to client devices. Global conditions are accessed from the **Requirements** page of the Create Deployment Type Wizard.  

> [!NOTE]  
>  You can edit global conditions only from the site where they were created.  

 Use the following procedures to create Configuration Manager global conditions.  

## Provide basic information about the global condition  
 Several different types of global conditions are available. Different options are associated with the different global condition types. When you select a specific global condition type, Configuration Manager shows the options that apply to your selection.  

1.  In the Configuration Manager console, choose **Software Library** > **Application Management** > **Global Conditions**.  

3.  On the **Home** tab, in the **Create** group, choose **Create Global Condition**.  

4.  In the **Create Global Condition** dialog box, provide a name and an optional description for the global condition.  

5.  In the **Device type** drop-down list, choose whether the global condition is for a **Windows** computer or a **Windows Mobile** device.  

6.  In the **Condition Type** drop-down list, choose one of the following options:  

    -   **Setting** – This option checks for the existence of one or more items on client devices. For example, you can check that a file, folder, or registry key value exists on a client device.  

    -   **Expression** – This option lets you to set up more complex rules to check if the condition is satisfied on client devices. For example, you can check if the physical memory on a computer is between 2 GB and 4 GB or if a mobile device uses touch screen input.  

## Set up rules for the global condition  
 The procedure to define the global condition rules is different depending on whether you are configuring a setting or an expression. Use the applicable procedure here to set up a setting or an expression for the global condition.  

### To set up a setting for the global condition  

1. In the **Condition Type** drop-down list, choose **Setting**.  

2. In the **Setting type** drop-down list, choose the item to use as the condition for which requirements will be checked. The following setting types and configurations are available.  

   - **Active Directory query**  

     -   **LDAP prefix** - Specify a valid LDAP prefix to the Active Directory Domain Services query to assess compliance on client computers. You can use either **LDAP://** or **GC://**.  

     -   **Distinguished name (DN)** - Specify the distinguished name of the Active Directory Domain Services object that will be assessed for compliance on client computers.  

     -   **Search filter** - Specify an optional LDAP filter to refine the results from the Active Directory Domain Services query to assess compliance on client computers.  

     -   **Search scope** - Specify the search scope in Active Directory Domain Services:  

         -   **Base** - Queries only the specified object.  

         -   **One Level** - This option is not used in this version of Configuration Manager.  

         -   **Subtree** -  Queries the specified object and its complete subtree in the directory.  

     -   **Property** - Specify the property of the Active Directory Domain Services object that will be used to assess compliance on client computers.  

     -   **Query** - Shows the LDAP query that is constructed from the entries in **LDAP prefix**, **Distinguished name (DN)**, **Search Filter** if specified, and **Property**. This query will be used to assess compliance on client computers.  

   - **Assembly**  

     -   **Assembly name** - Specifies the name of the assembly object to search for. The name cannot be the same as any other assembly object of the same type, and the name must be registered in the Global Assembly Cache. The assembly name can be a maximum of 256 characters.  

     > [!NOTE]  
     >  An assembly is a piece of code that can be shared between applications. Assemblies can have the .dll or .exe file name extension. The Global Assembly Cache is a folder named *%systemroot%\assembly* on client computers in which all shared assemblies are stored.  

   - **File system**  

     - **Type** – From the drop-down list, choose whether you want to search for a **File** or a **Folder**.  

     - **Path** - Specify the path to the specified file or folder on client computers. You can specify system environment variables and the *%USERPROFILE%* environment variable in the path.  

       > [!NOTE]  
       >  If you use the *%USERPROFILE%* environment variable in the **Path** or **File or folder name** fields, all user profiles on the client computer will be searched. This could result in the discovery of multiple instances of the file or folder.  

     - **File or folder name** - Specify the name of the file or folder object that will be searched for. You can specify system environment variables and the *%USERPROFILE%* environment variable in the file or folder name. You can also use the * and ? wildcards in the file name.  

       > [!NOTE]  
       >  If you specify a file or folder name and use wildcards, this might produce a high numbers of results. This could result in high resource use on the client computer and high network traffic when reporting results to Configuration Manager.  

     - **Include subfolders** – Enable this option if you also want to search any subfolders under the specified path.  

     - **This file or   folder is associated with a 64-bit application** - Choose whether the 64-bit system file location (*%windir%*\system32) should be searched in addition to the 32-bit system file location (*%windir%*\syswow64) on Configuration Manager clients that run a 64-bit version of Windows.  

       > [!NOTE]  
       >  If the same file or folder exists in both the 64-bit and 32-bit system file locations on the same 64-bit computer, multiple files will be discovered by the global condition.  

       The **File system** setting type does not support specifying a UNC path to a network share in the **Path** field.  

   - **IIS metabase**  

     -   **Metabase path** - Specify a valid path to the IIS Metabase.

     -   **This registry key is associated with a 64-bit application** - Specifies whether the 64-bit registry keys should be searched in addition to the 32-bit registry keys on clients that run a 64-bit version of Windows.  

         > [!NOTE]  
         >  If the same registry key exists in both the 64-bit and 32-bit registry locations on the same 64-bit computer, both registry keys will be discovered by the global condition.  

   - **Registry value**  

     -   **Hive** - From the drop-down list, select the registry hive that you want to search in.  

     -   **Key** - Specify the registry key name that you want to search for. The format used should be *key\subkey*.  

     -   **Value** – Specify the value that must be contained within the specified registry key.  

     -   **This registry key is associated with a 64-bit application** - Specifies whether the 64-bit registry keys should be searched in addition to the 32-bit registry keys on clients that run a 64-bit version of Windows.  

         > [!NOTE]  
         >  If the same registry key exists in both the 64-bit and 32-bit registry locations on the same 64-bit computer, both registry keys will be discovered by the global condition.  

   - **Script**  

     -   **Discovery script** – Choose **Add** to enter, or browse to the script to use. You can use Windows PowerShell, VBScript, or JScript scripts.  

     -   **Run scripts by using the logged on user credentials** – If you enable this option, the script will run on client computers by using the credentials of the user who is signed in.  

         > [!NOTE]  
         >  The value returned by the script will be used to assess the compliance of the global condition. For example, when you use VBScript, you could use the **WScript.Echo Result** command to return the Result variable value to the global condition.  
         >   
         >  If your script returns multiple values, these values must be on a single line and separated with a semi-colon. If each value is on a separate line, the evaluation will fail.  

   - **SQL query**  

     -   **SQL Server instance** – Choose whether you want the SQL query to run on the default instance, all instances, or a specified database instance name.  

         > [!NOTE]  
         >  The instance name must refer to a local instance of SQL Server. To refer to a clustered SQL server instance, you should use a script setting.  

     -   **Database** - Specify the name of the Microsoft SQL Server database for which the SQL query will be run.  

     -   **Column** - Specify the column name returned by the Transact-SQL statement to use to assess the compliance of the global condition.

     -   **Property** - Specifies the WMI property that will be used to build a WQL query that will be assessed for compliance on client computers.  

     -   **WQL query WHERE clause** - You can use the **WQL query WHERE clause** item to specify a WHERE clause to be applied to the specified namespace, class, and property on client computers.  

   - **XPath query**  

     -   **Path** - Specify the path to the XML file on client computers that will be used to assess compliance. Configuration Manager supports the use of all Windows system environment variables and the *%USERPROFILE%* user variable in the path name.  

     -   **XML file name** - Specify the file name that contains the XML query to use to assess compliance on client computers.  

     -   **Include subfolders** - Enable this option if you also want to search any subfolders under the specified path.  

     -   **This file is associated with a 64-bit application** - Choose whether the 64-bit system file location (*%windir%*\system32) should be searched in addition to the 32-bit system file location (*%windir%*\syswow64) on Configuration Manager clients that run a 64-bit version of Windows.  

     -   **XPath query** - Specify a valid full XML path language (XPath) query to use to assess compliance on client computers.
