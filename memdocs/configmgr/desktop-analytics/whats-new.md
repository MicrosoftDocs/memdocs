## March 2020

### Support for multiple hierarchies

<!-- 4814075, 6079184 -->

You can now connect multiple Configuration Manager hierarchies to a single Azure Active Directory tenant with a single Commercial ID for Desktop Analytics. The portal categorizes devices from different hierarchies, and improves the experiences for global pilots and deployment plans.

- When you configure your global pilot, if you include collections that contain more than 20% of your total enrolled devices, the portal displays a warning.
- When you create a deployment plan, if you select collections for multiple hierarchies, the portal displays a warning.

> [!NOTE]
> Support for multiple hierarchies requires Configuration Manager version 1910 or later.

For more information, see the following articles:

- [Global pilot](deploy-pilot.md#bkmk_GlobalPilot)
- [How to create deployment plans](create-deployment-plans.md)

### Identify compatibility safeguards

<!-- 5746559 -->

Windows compatibility data classifies some apps and drivers with a *safeguard*, which may cause the update to Windows 10 to fail or rollback. Desktop Analytics can now help you to identify these safeguards in advance, so that you can remediate the asset before you deploy the update. For more information, see [Compatibility assessment - Safeguards](compat-assessment.md#safeguards).

## January 2020

### Additional app usage detail

<!-- 5533890 -->

When you select an app to see more information, the details pane now includes additional usage information. You can use this data to help understand the breadth of install for an app, as well as devices on which users regularly use the app. For more information, see [About assets - App usage](about-assets.md#usage).

### Provide feedback on Desktop Analytics

<!-- 5451636 -->

To share your feedback about Desktop Analytics, select the **Send a Smile** icon at the top of the portal on the right side. For more information, see [Share product feedback](get-support.md#bkmk_feedback).

### Improvements to compatibility recommendations

<!-- 3733897 -->

### Automatic upgrade decision of system and store apps

<!-- 3587232 -->

To help reduce your efforts in annotating noteworthy apps, certain types of apps are automatically marked as *Not important*. The deployment plan upgrade decision for these apps is also marked as *Ready*. The following apps are compatible and should continue to work after you upgrade Windows:

- System apps and components published by Microsoft

- Apps managed and updated from the Microsoft Store

For more information, see [Automatic upgrade decision of system and store apps](about-assets.md#bkmk_plan-autoapp).
