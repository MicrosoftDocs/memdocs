# How to set up Desktop Analytics

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Desktop Analytics is deprecated and will be retired on November 30, 2022. For more information, see [What's new](whats-new.md).<!-- 10946169 -->

Use this procedure to sign in to Desktop Analytics and configure it in your subscription. This procedure is a one-time process to set up Desktop Analytics for your organization.

> [!NOTE]
> For information about the general prerequisites for Desktop Analytics with Configuration Manager, see [Prerequisites](overview.md#prerequisites).

## Initial onboarding

1. Open the [Desktop Analytics portal](https://aka.ms/desktopanalytics) in the Microsoft Intune admin center as a user with the **Global Admin** role. Select **Start**. Alternatively, on the Configuration Manager console, go to the **Software Library** workspace, select the **Desktop Analytics Servicing** node, and select **Plan deployments**.

2. On the **Accept service agreement** page, review the service agreement, and select **Accept**.  

3. On the **Confirm your subscription** page, review the list of required qualifying licenses. Switch the setting to **Yes** next to **Do you have one of the supported or higher subscriptions**, and then select **Next**.  

4. On the **Give users access** page:

    - **Allow Desktop Analytics to manage Directory roles on your behalf**: Desktop Analytics automatically assigns the **Workspace Owners** the **Desktop Analytics Administrator** role. If those groups are already a **Global Admin**, there's no change.

        If you don't select this option, Desktop Analytics still adds users as members of the security group. A **Global Admin** needs to manually assign the **Desktop Analytics Administrator** role for the users.

        For more information about assigning administrator role permissions in Microsoft Entra ID and the permissions assigned to **Desktop Analytics Administrators**, see [Administrator role permissions in Microsoft Entra ID](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference).  

    - Desktop Analytics preconfigures the **Workspace Owners** security group in Microsoft Entra ID to create and manage workspaces and deployment plans.

        To add a user to the group, type their name or e-mail address in the **Enter name or email address** section. When finished, select **Next**.

5. On the page to **Set up your workspace**:  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > To complete this step, the user needs **Workspace Owner** permissions and additional access to the Azure subscription and Resource Group. For more information, see [prerequisites](overview.md#prerequisites).  

    - To use an existing workspace for Desktop Analytics, select it, and continue with the next step.  

        > [!TIP]  
        > You can only have one Desktop Analytics workspace per Microsoft Entra tenant. Devices can only send diagnostic data to one workspace.  

    - To create a workspace for Desktop Analytics, select **Add workspace**.  

        1. Enter a globally unique **Workspace name**.

        2. Select the drop-down list to **Select the Azure subscription name for this workspace**, and choose the Azure subscription for this workspace.  

        3. **Create new** Resource group or **Use existing**.

        4. Select the **Region** from the list, and then select **Add**.  

6. Select a new or existing workspace, and then select **Set as Desktop Analytics workspace**.  Then select **Continue** in the **Confirm and grant access** dialog.  

7. In the new browser tab, pick an account to use to sign in. Select the option to **Consent on behalf of your organization** and select **Accept**.  

    > [!Note]  
    > This consent is to assign the MALogAnalyticsReader application the Log Analytics Reader role for the workspace. This application role is required by Desktop Analytics. For more information, see [MALogAnalyticsReader application role](troubleshooting.md#bkmk_MALogAnalyticsReader).  

8. Back on the page to **Set up your workspace**, select **Next**.  

9. On the **Last steps** page, select **Go to Desktop Analytics**.

The admin center shows the Desktop Analytics **Home** page.
