# Desktop Analytics data privacy

Desktop Analytics is fully committed to customer data privacy, centering on these tenets:

- **Transparency:** We fully document the Windows diagnostic events. Review them with your company's security and compliance teams. The Windows Diagnostic Data Viewer lets you see diagnostic data sent from a given device. For more information, see [Diagnostic Data Viewer Overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/configuration/diagnostic-data-viewer-overview).  

- **Control:** You control the level of diagnostic data to share with Microsoft. Windows 10, version 1709, adds a new policy to limit enhanced diagnostic data to the minimum required by Desktop Analytics.  

- **Security:** Microsoft protects your data with strong security and encryption.  

- **Trust:** Desktop Analytics supports the Microsoft [Privacy Statement](https://privacy.microsoft.com/privacystatement) and [Online Service Terms](https://www.microsoftvolumelicensing.com/DocumentSearch.aspx?Mode=3&DocumentTypeId=46).

## Data flow

The following illustration shows how diagnostic data flows from individual devices through the Diagnostic Data Service, transient storage, and to your Log Analytics workspace:

![Diagram illustrating flow of diagnostic data from devices](media/da-data-flow.png)

1. You sign in to the Azure portal, and onboard to Desktop Analytics. You create the Azure AD app to connect with Configuration Manager. When you set up Desktop Analytics, you create an Azure Log Analytics workspace in the location of your choice.  

2. You connect Configuration Manager and enroll devices  

    1. You configure the Desktop Analytics cloud service in Configuration Manager with the Azure AD app details.  

    2. Within 15 minutes, Configuration Manager synchronizes the following data with Desktop Analytics using your tenant ID. It repeats this process every hour.

      - Information about device collections necessary to [create deployment plans](create-deployment-plans.md). This information includes collection ID, hierarchy ID, collection name, and device count. 
      - Information required to [enroll devices](enroll-devices.md). This information includes collection ID, SMS unique identifier, OS build version, device name, and serial number.
      - Information from the [monitor connection health](monitor-connection-health.md) dashboard. This information includes the count of devices per health state, and device properties.
      - Information about deployment plans, which includes the collection ID, deployment ID, pilot or production deployment type, and count of devices per upgrade decision.

    3. Configuration Manager sets the commercial ID, diagnostic data level, and other settings for the devices in the target collection. This configuration specifies the devices to appear in your Desktop Analytics workspace.  

    4. You deploy compatibility updates to all target devices.  

3. Devices send diagnostic data to the Microsoft Diagnostic Data Management service for Windows. All diagnostic data is encrypted over HTTPS and uses certificate pinning during transfer from the device to this service. The Microsoft Data Management Service is hosted in the United States.

      - Application faults, kernel faults, unresponsive applications, and other application specific problems use the Windows Error Reporting API to send application-specific problem reports to Microsoft. See [Using WER](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/win32/wer/using-wer) for specific details about this dataflow.
      
4. Each day, Microsoft produces a snapshot of IT-focused insights. This snapshot combines the diagnostic data from Windows with your input for the enrolled devices. This process happens in transient storage, which is only used by Desktop Analytics. The transient storage is hosted in Microsoft data centers in the United States. All data is sent over an SSL (HTTPS) encrypted channel. The snapshots are segregated by commercial ID.  

5. The snapshots are then copied to your Azure Log Analytics workspace. This data transfer happens over HTTPS through the webhook ingestion protocol, which is a feature of Log Analytics. Desktop Analytics doesn't have any read or write permissions to your Log Analytics storage. Desktop Analytics calls the webhook API with a shared access signature (SAS) URI. Then Log Analytics gets the data from the storage tables over HTTPS.

6. Desktop Analytics stores your input in Log Analytics storage. These configurations include deployment plans, and asset decisions for upgrade and importance.

Separate from Desktop Analytics, Configuration Manager sends diagnostic and usage data to Microsoft. Microsoft uses this data to improve the installation experience, quality, and security of future releases of Configuration Manager.
