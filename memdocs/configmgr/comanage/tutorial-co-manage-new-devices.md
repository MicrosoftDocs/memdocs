# Tutorial: Enable co-management for new internet-based devices

With co-management, you can keep your well-established processes for using Configuration Manager to manage PCs in your organization. At the same time, you're investing in the cloud through use of Intune for security and modern provisioning.

In this tutorial, you set up co-management of Windows 10 devices in an environment where you use both Azure Active Directory (AD) and an on-premises AD but don't have a [hybrid Azure Active Directory](/azure/active-directory/devices/concept-azure-ad-join-hybrid) (AD). The Configuration Manager environment includes a single primary site with all site system roles located on the same server, the site server. This tutorial begins with the premise that your Windows 10 devices are already enrolled with Intune. 

If you have a hybrid Azure AD that joins your on-premises AD with Azure AD, we recommend following our companion tutorial, [Enable co-management for Configuration Manager clients](tutorial-co-manage-clients.md).

Use this tutorial when:
  
- You have Windows 10 devices to bring into co-management. These devices might have been provisioned through Windows Autopilot or are direct from your hardware OEM.
- You have Windows 10 devices on the internet that you currently manage with Intune to which you want to add the Configuration Manager client.

**In this tutorial you will:**  
> [!div class="checklist"]  
> * Review prerequisites for Azure and your on-premises environment
> * Request a public SSL certificate for the cloud management gateway (CMG)
> * Enable Azure services in Configuration Manager
> * Deploy and configure a cloud management gateway  
> * Configure the management point and clients to use the CMG
> * Enable co-management in Configuration Manager
> * Configure Intune to install the Configuration Manager client

## Prerequisites  

### Azure services and environment

- Azure Subscription ([free trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/free))
- Azure Active Directory Premium
- Microsoft Intune subscription
  > [!TIP]  
  > An Enterprise Mobility and Security (EMS) Subscription includes both Azure Active Directory Premium and Microsoft Intune. EMS Subscription ([free trial](https://www.microsoft.com/cloud-platform/enterprise-mobility-security-trial)).  

- Intune is configured to [auto-enroll devices](tutorial-co-manage-clients.md#configure-auto-enrollment-of-devices-to-intune)  

> [!TIP]
> You no longer need to purchase and assign individual Intune or EMS licenses to your users. For more information, see the [Product and licensing FAQ](../core/understand/product-and-licensing-faq.md#bkmk_mem).

### On-premises infrastructure

- Configuration Manager current branch, version 1810 or later.
  
  Version 1810 introduces [Enhanced HTTP](../core/plan-design/hierarchy/enhanced-http.md), which is used in this tutorial to avoid more complex PKI requirements. Through use of Enhanced HTTP, the primary site that you use to manage clients must be configured to use Configuration Manager-generated certificates for HTTP site systems.  

  Version 1810 also introduces a simpler command line for internet-based installation of the Configuration Manager client.

- The MDM authority must be set to Intune  

### External certificates

- CMG server authentication certificate. This certificate is an SSL certificate from a public and globally trusted certificate provider. For example, but not limited to, DigiCert, Thawte, or VeriSign. You'll export this certificate as .PFX file with Private Key.  

- Later in this tutorial we provide guidance on how to configure the request for this certificate.

### Permissions

Throughout this tutorial, use the following permissions to complete tasks:

- An account that is a *global administrator* for Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)
- An account that is a *domain admin* on your on-premises infrastructure  
- An account that is a *full administrator* for *all* scopes in Configuration Manager

## Request a public certificate for the cloud management gateway

When your devices are on the internet, co-management requires the Configuration Manager cloud management gateway (CMG). The CMG enables your internet-based Windows 10 devices to communicate with your on-premises Configuration Manager deployment. To establish a trust between devices and your Configuration Manager environment, the CMG requires an SSL certificate.

This tutorial uses a public certificate called **CMG server authentication certificate** that derives authority from a globally trusted certificate provider. Although it's possible to configure co-management using certificates that derive authority from your on-premises Microsoft certificate authority, use of self-signed certificates is beyond the scope of this tutorial.

The **CMG server authentication certificate** is used to encrypt the communications traffic between the Configuration Manager client and the CMG. The certificate traces back to a Trusted Root to verify the server's identity to the client. The public certificate includes a Trusted Root that Windows clients already trust.

About this certificate: 

- You identify a unique name for your CMG service in Azure, and then specify that name in your certificate request.  
- You generate your certificate request on a specific server, and then submit the request to a public certificate provider to get the necessary SSL certificate.  
- You import to the system that generated the request the certificate you receive back from the provider. You use the same computer to export the certificate for use when you later deploy the CMG to Azure.  
- When the CMG installs, it creates a CMG service in Azure using the name you specified in the certificate.  

### Identify a unique name for your cloud management gateway in Azure

When you request the CMG server authentication certificate, you specify what must be a unique name to identify your *Cloud service (classic)* in Azure. By default, the Azure public cloud uses *cloudapp.net*, and the CMG is hosted within the cloudapp.net domain as *\<YourUniqueDnsName>.cloudapp.net*.  

> [!TIP]  
> In this tutorial, the **CMG server authentication certificate** uses an FQDN that ends in *contoso.com*.  After we create the CMG we'll configure a canonical name record (CNAME) in our organization's public DNS. This record creates an alias for the CMG that maps to the name that we use in the public certificate.  

Before you request your public certificate, confirm the name you want to use is available in Azure. You don't directly create the service in Azure. Instead, the name that's specified in the public certificate you request is used by Configuration Manager to create the cloud service when you install the CMG.  

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).  

2. Select **Create a resource**, choose the **Compute** category, then select **Cloud Service**. The Cloud service (classic) page opens.

3. For **DNS name**, specify the prefix name for the cloud service you'll use. This prefix must be the same as what you use later when you request a publish certificate for the CMG server authentication certificate. We use *MyCSG*, which creates the namespace of *MyCSG.cloudapp.net*. The interface confirms whether the name is available or already in use by another service.  
 After you confirm the name you want to use is available, you're ready to submit the Certificate Signing Request (CSR).

### Request the certificate

Use the following information to submit a certificate signing request for your CMG to a public certificate provider. Change the following values to be relevant to your environment.  

- *MyCMG* to identify the service name of the cloud management gateway
- *Contoso* as the company name
- *Contoso.com* as the public domain

We recommend you use your primary site server to generate the certificate signing requests (CSR). When you get the certificate, you must enroll it on the same server that generated the CSR or you can't export the certificates private key, which is required.  

Request a version 2 key provider type when you generate a CSR. Only version 2 certificates are supported.  

> [!TIP]  
> When we deploy the CMG, we will also install a cloud distribution point (CDP) at the same time. By default, when you deploy a CMG, the option **Allow CMG to function as a cloud distribution point and serve content from Azure storage** is selected. Co-locating the CDP on the server with the CMG removes the need for separate certificates and configurations to support the CDP. Even though the CDP isn't required to use co-management, it is useful in most environments.  
>
> If you use any additional, separate CDPs, you need to request separate certificates for each additional CDP. To request a public certificate for a CDP, use the same details as for the cloud management gateway CSR. You need to only change the common name so that it is unique for each CDP.
>
> Using an additional, separate CDP is deprecated and no longer recommended. For more information, see [Deprecated features](../core/plan-design/changes/deprecated/removed-and-deprecated-cmfeatures.md#deprecated-features).

#### Details for the cloud management gateway CSR

- **Common Name**: CloudServiceNameCMG.YourCompanyPubilcDomainName.com  
Example: MyCSG.contoso.com  
- **Subject Alternative Name**: Same as the Common Name (CN)  
- **Organization**:  The name of your organization  
- **Department**: Per your organization  
- **City**: Per your organization  
- **State**: Per your organization  
- **Country**: Per your organization  
- **Key Size: 2048**  
- **Provider: Microsoft RSA SChannel Cryptographic Provider**  

### Import the certificate

After you receive the public certificate, import it to the local certificate store of the computer that created the CSR. Then export the certificate as a .PFX file so you can use it for your CMG in Azure.  

Public certificate providers typically provide instructions for import of the certificate. The process to import the certificate should resemble the following guidance:  

1. On the computer that the certificate is to be imported to, locate the certificate .pfx file.  

2. Right-click the file, and then select **Install PFX**  

3. When the Certificate Import Wizard starts, select **Next**.  

4. On the **File to Import** page, select **Next**.

5. On the **Password** page, enter the password for the private key in the Password box, and then select **Next**.  
  
   Select the option to make the key exportable.

6. On the **Certificate Store page**, choose **Automatically select the certificate store based on the type of certificate**, and then select **Next**.  

7. Select **Finish**.

### Export the certificate

Export the *CMG server authentication certificate* from your server. Re-exporting the certificate makes it usable for your cloud management gateway in Azure.  

1. On the server where you imported the public SSL certificate, run **certlm.msc** to open the Certificate Manager console.  

2. In the Certificate Manager console, select **Personal > Certificates**. Then, right-click on the *CMG server authentication certificate* you enrolled in the previous procedure, and then select **All Tasks > Export**.  

3. In the Certificate Export Wizard, select **Next**, select **Yes, export the private key**, and then **Next**.  

4. On the Export File Format page, select **Personal Information Exchange - PKCS #12 (.PFX)**, select **Next**, and provide a password. For file name, specify a name like **C:\ConfigMgrCloudMGServer**. You'll reference this file when you create the CMG in Azure.  

5. Select **Next**, and then confirm the following settings before selecting **Finish** to complete the export:  

   - Export Keys = Yes  
   - Include all certificates in the certification path = Yes  
   - File format = Personal Information Exchange (*.pfx)  

6. After you complete the export, locate the .pfx file and place a copy of it in **C:\Certs** on the Configuration Manager primary site server that will manage internet-based clients. The Certs folder is a temporary folder to use while moving certificates between servers. You access the certificate file from the primary site server when you deploy the cloud management gateway to Azure.  

After you copy the certificate to the primary site server, you can delete the Certificate from the Personal Certificate store on the member server.

## Enable Azure cloud services in Configuration Manager

To configure Azure services from within the Configuration Manager console, you use the Configure Azure Services wizard and create two Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) apps.  

- **Server app** –  a *Web app* in Azure AD  
- **Client app** – a *Native Client* app in Azure AD  

Run the following procedure from the primary site server.  

1. From the primary site server, open the Configuration Manager console and go to **Administration > Cloud Services > Azure Services**, and select **Configure Azure Services**.  

   On the Configure Azure Service page, specify a friendly Name for the cloud management service you're configuring. For example: *My cloud management service*.

   Then select **Cloud Management**, and then select **Next**.  

   > [!TIP]  
   > For more information about the configurations you make in the wizard, see [Start the Azure Services wizard](../core/servers/deploy/configure/Azure-services-wizard.md#start-the-azure-services-wizard)

2. On the **App Properties** page, for **Web app**, select **Browse** to open the **Server App** dialog, and then select **Create**. Configure the following fields:

   - **Application Name**: Specify a friendly name for the app, such as *Cloud Management web app*.  

   - **HomePage URL**: This value isn't used by Configuration Manager but is required by Azure AD. By default, this value is `https://ConfigMgrService`.  

   - **App ID URI**: This value needs to be unique in your Azure AD tenant. It is in the access token used by the Configuration Manager client to request access to the service. By default, this value is `https://ConfigMgrService`.  

   Next, select **Sign in**, and specify an Azure AD Global Administrator account. These credentials aren't saved by Configuration Manager. This persona doesn't require permissions in Configuration Manager and doesn't need to be the same account that runs the Azure Services Wizard.

   After you sign in, the results display. Select **OK** to close the Create Server Application dialog and return to the App Properties page.

3. For **Native Client app**, select **Browse** to open the **Client app** dialog.

4. Select **Create** to open the **Create Client Application** dialog, and then configure the following fields:  

   - **Application Name**: Specify a friendly name for the app, such as *Cloud Management native client app*.

   - **Reply URL**: This value isn't used by Configuration Manager, but required by Azure AD. By default, this value is `https://ConfigMgrClient`.
   Next, select **Sign in**, and specify an Azure AD Global Administrator account. Like the Web app, these credentials aren't saved and don't require permissions in Configuration Manager.

   After you sign in, the results are display. Select **OK** to close the Create Client Application dialog and return to the App Properties page. Then, select **Next** to continue.

5. On the **Configure Discovery Settings** page, check the box for **Enable Azure Active Directory User Discovery**, select **Next**, and then complete configuration of the Discovery dialogs for your environment.  

6. Continue through the Summary, Progress, and Completion pages, and then close the wizard.  

   Azure Services for Azure AD User discovery is now enabled in Configuration Manager.  Leave the console open for now.  

7. Open a browser and sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).  

8. Select **All services > Azure Active Directory > App registrations**, and then:

   1. Select the Web app you created.

   2. Go to **API Permissions** > select **Grant admin consent for** <your tenant>, and then select **Yes**.  

   3. Select the Native Client app you created.

   4. Go to **API Permissions** > select **Grant admin consent for** <your tenant>, and then select **Yes**.

9. In the Configuration Manager console, go to **Administration > Overview > Cloud Services > Azure Services**, and select your Azure Service. Then right-click on **Azure Active Directory User Discover** and select **Run Full Discovery Now**. Select **Yes** to confirm the action.  

10. On the primary site server, open the Configuration Manager **SMS_AZUREAD_DISCOVERY_AGENT.log** and look for the following entry to confirm that discovery is working:  *Successfully published UDX for Azure Active Directory users*  

    By default, the log file is in *%Program_Files%\Microsoft Configuration Manager\Logs*.  

## Create the cloud services in Azure

**In this section of the tutorial you will**:

- Create the CMG cloud service  
- Create DNS CNAME records for both services  

### Create the CMG

Use this procedure to install a cloud management gateway as a service in Azure. The CMG installs at the top-tier site of the hierarchy. In this tutorial, we continue to use the primary site where certificates have been enrolled and exported.

1. On the primary site server, open the Configuration Manager console, and then go **Administration > Overview > Cloud Services > Cloud Management Gateway**, and then select **Create Cloud Management Gateway**.  

2. On the **General** page:  

   1. Select your cloud environment for **Azure environment**. This tutorial uses **AzurePublicCloud**.  

   2. Select **Azure Resource Manager deployment**.  
  
   3. **Sign in** to your Azure subscription. Configuration Manager fills in additional information based on the information you configured when you enabled Azure cloud services for Configuration Manager.  

   Select **Next** to continue.  

3. On the **Settings** page, browse to and select the file named **ConfigMgrCloudMGServer.pfx**, which is the file you exported after importing the CMG server authentication certificate. After you specify the password, the **Service name** and **Deployment name** automatically fill, based on the details in the .pfx certificate file.

4. Set your **Region**.

5. For **Resource Group**, use an existing resource group or create a group with a friendly name that uses no spaces, like **CofigMgrCloudServices**. If you choose to create a group, the group is added as a resource group in Azure.  

6. Unless you're ready to configure at scale, use one (1) for the number of **VM Instances**. The number of VM Instances allows a single Cloud Management Gateway (CMG) Cloud service to scale out to support more client connections. Later, you can use the Configuration Manager console to return and edit the number of VM instances you use.  

7. Enable the checkbox for **Verify Client Certificate Revocation**.

8. Enable the checkbox for **Allow CMG to function as a cloud distribution point and serve content from Azure storage** if you want to deploy a cloud distribution point with the CMG.

9. Select **Next** to continue.

10. Review the values on the **Alert** page, and then select **Next**.

11. Review the **Summary** page and click **Next** to create the cloud management gateway Cloud Service. Select **Close** to complete the Wizard.  

12. In the Cloud Management Gateway node of the Configuration Manager console, you can now view the new service.  

### Create DNS CNAME records

When you create a DNS entry for the CMG, you enable your Windows 10 devices both inside and outside your corporate network to use name resolution to find the CMG cloud service in Azure.

Our CNAME record example uses the following details:  

- The company name is **Contoso** with a public DNS namespace of ***Contoso.com***.  

- The CMG service name is **MyCMG**, which becomes ***MyCMG.CloudApp.Net*** in Azure.  

CNAME record example: *MyCMG.contoso.com => My.cloudapp.net*

## Configure the management point and clients to use the CMG

Configure settings that enable on-premises management points and clients to use the cloud management gateway.

Because we use Enhanced HTTP for client communications, there's no need to use an HTTPS management point.  

### Create the CMG connection point

Configure the site to support Enhanced HTTP.  

1. In the Configuration Manager console, go to **Administration > Overview > Site Configuration > Sites**, and open the properties of the primary site.  

2. On the **Client Computer Communication** tab, select the *HTTPS or HTTP* option for **Use Configuration Manager-generated certificates for HTTP site systems**, and then select **OK** to save the configuration.

    > [!Note]
    > Starting in version 1906, this tab is called **Communication Security**.<!-- SCCMDocs#1645 -->  

3. Now go to **Administration > Overview > Site Configuration > Servers and Site System Roles** and select the server with a management point where you want to install the cloud management gateway connection point.  

4. Select **Add Site System Roles**, and then **Next**> **Next**.  

5. Select the **Cloud management gateway connection point** and then select **Next** to continue.  

6. Review the default selections on the **Cloud management gateway connection point** page and make sure the correct CMG is selected. If you have multiple cloud management gateways, you can use the dropdown list to specify a different CMG. You can also change the CMG in use, after installation. Select **Next** to continue.

7. Select **Next** to start installation and then view the results on the Completion page.  Select **Close** to complete the installation of the connection point.

8. Now go to **Administration > Overview > Site Configuration > Servers and Site System Roles** and open the **Properties** for the management point where you installed the connection point. On the **General** tab, check the box for **Allow Configuration Manager cloud management gateway traffic**, and then select **OK** to save the configuration.
   > [!TIP]  
   > While not required to enable co-management, we recommend that you make this same edit for any software update points.

### Configure Client Settings to direct clients to use the CMG

Use Client Settings to configure Configuration Manager clients to communicate with the CMG.  

1. Open the **Configuration Manager console > Administration > Overview > Client Settings**, and then edit the **Default Client Settings**.  

2. Select **Cloud Services**.

3. On the **Default Settings** page, set the following settings to = **Yes**.  

   - **Automatically register new Windows 10 domain joined devices with Azure Active Directory**  

   - **Enable clients to use a cloud management gateway**

   - **Allow access to cloud distribution point**

4. On the **Client Policy** page, set **Enable user policy requests from internet clients** = **Yes**.

5. Select **OK** to save this configuration.

## Enable co-management in Configuration Manager

With the Azure configurations, site system roles, and client settings in place, you can configure Configuration Manager to enable co-management. However, you'll still need to make a few configurations in Intune after you enable co-management before this tutorial is complete. One of those tasks is to configure Intune to deploy the Configuration Manager client. That task is made easier by saving the command line for client deployment that is available from within the Co-management Configuration Wizard. That is why we enable co-management now, before we complete the configurations for Intune.

> [!TIP]
> - When you enable co-management, you'll assign a collection as a *Pilot group*. This is a group that contains a small number of clients to test your co-management configurations. We recommend you create a suitable collection before you start the procedure. Then you can select that collection without exiting the procedure to do so.
> - Starting in Configuration Manager version 1906, you may need multiple collections since you can assign a different *Pilot group* for each workload.

### Enable co-management starting in version 1906

[!INCLUDE [Enable Co-management in version 1906 and later](includes/enable-co-management-1906-and-higher.md)]

### Enable co-management in version 1902 and earlier

[!INCLUDE [Enable Co-management in version 1902 and earlier](includes/enable-co-management-1902-and-earlier.md)]

## Use Intune to deploy the Configuration Manager client

You can use Intune to install the Configuration Manager client on Windows 10 devices that are currently only managed with Intune.  

Then, when a previously unmanaged Windows 10 device enrolls with Intune, it automatically installs the Configuration Manager client.

### Create an Intune app to install the Configuration Manager client

1. From the primary site server, sign in to the [Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center](https://endpoint.microsoft.com) and go to the **Apps** > **All Apps** > **Add**.

2. For app type, select **Line-of-business app** under **Other**.

3. For the **App package file**, browse to the location of the Configuration Manager file  **ccmsetup.msi**, and then select **Open > OK**.
For example, *C:\Program Files\Microsoft Configuration Manager\bin\i386\ccmsetup.msi*

4. Select **App Information**, and then specify the following details:
   - **Description**: Configuration Manager Client  

   - **Publisher**: Microsoft  

   - **Command-line arguments**:  *\<Specify the **CCMSETUPCMD** command line. You can use the command line you saved from the* Enablement *page of the Co-management Configuration Wizard. This command line includes the names of your cloud service and additional values that enable devices to install the Configuration Manager client software.>*  

     The command-line structure should resemble this example using only the CCMSETUPCMD and SMSSiteCode parameters:  

     ``` Command
     CCMSETUPCMD="CCMHOSTNAME=<ServiceName.CLOUDAPP.NET/CCM_Proxy_MutualAuth/<GUID>" SMSSiteCode="<YourSiteCode>"  
     ```

     > [!TIP]  
     > If you do not have the command line available, you can view the properties of *CoMgmtSettingsProd* in the Configuration Manager console to get a copy of the command line.

5. Select **OK > Add**.  The app is created and becomes available in the Intune console. After the app is available, you can use the following section to configure Intune to assign it to Windows 10 devices.

### Assign the Intune app to install the Configuration Manager client

The following procedure deploys the app for installing the Configuration Manager client that you created in the previous procedure.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center](https://endpoint.microsoft.com). Select **Apps** > **All Apps** and then select **ConfigMgr Client Setup Bootstrap**, the app you created to deploy the Configuration Manager client.  

2. Select **Properties** then **Edit** for **Assignments**. Select **Add group** under **Required** assignments to set the Azure Active Directory (AD) groups that have users and devices that you want to participate in co-management.  

3. Select **Review + save** and then **Save** the configuration.
The app is now required by users and devices you assigned it to. After the app installs the Configuration Manager client on a device, it's managed by co-management.

## Summary

After you complete the configuration steps of this tutorial, you can start co-managing your devices.

## Next steps

- Review the status of co-managed devices with the [Co-management dashboard](how-to-monitor.md)
- Use [Windows Autopilot](quickstart-autopilot.md) to provision new devices
- Use [conditional access](quickstart-conditional-access.md) and Intune compliance rules to manage user access to corporate resources
