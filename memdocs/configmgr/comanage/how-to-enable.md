# How to enable co-management in Configuration Manager

When you enable co-management, you can gain immediate value. Then once you're ready, you can start transitioning workloads as needed and if desired in your environment.

The phrase **Pilot group** is used throughout the co-management feature and configuration dialogs. A *pilot group* is a collection containing a subset of your Configuration Manager devices. Use a *pilot group* for your initial testing, adding devices as needed, until you're ready to move the workloads for all Configuration Manager devices. There isn't a time limit on how long a *pilot group* can be used for workloads. A *pilot group* can be used indefinitely if you don't wish to move the workload to all Configuration Manager devices.

Make sure the co-management prerequisites are set up before you start this process. For more information, see [Prerequisites](overview.md#prerequisites).

## Enable co-management for versions 2111 and later

[!INCLUDE [Enable Co-management starting in version 2111](includes/enable-co-management-2111.md)]

## Enable co-management for versions 2107 and earlier

[!INCLUDE [Enable Co-management in versions 1906 through 2107](includes/enable-co-management-1906-2107.md)]


## Next steps

Now that you've enabled co-management, look at the following articles for immediate value you can gain in your environment:

- [Conditional access](quickstart-conditional-access.md)  

- [Remote actions from Intune](quickstart-remote-actions.md)  

- [Client health](quickstart-client-health.md)
