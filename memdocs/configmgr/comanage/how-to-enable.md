# How to enable co-management in Configuration Manager

When you enable co-management, you can gain immediate value. Then once you're ready, you can start transitioning workloads as needed and if desired in your environment.

The phrase **Pilot group** is used throughout the co-management feature and configuration dialogs. A *pilot group* is a collection containing a subset of your Configuration Manager devices. Use a *pilot group* for your initial testing, adding devices as needed, until you're ready to move the workloads for all Configuration Manager devices. There isn't a time limit on how long a *pilot group* can be used for workloads. A *pilot group* can be used indefinitely if you don't wish to move the workload to all Configuration Manager devices.

Make sure the co-management prerequisites are set up before you start this process. For more information, see [Prerequisites](overview.md#prerequisites).

> [!TIP]
> As a companion to this article, we recommend using the [co-management setup guide](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2224782) when signed in to the Microsoft 365 admin center. This guide will customize your experience based on your environment.
