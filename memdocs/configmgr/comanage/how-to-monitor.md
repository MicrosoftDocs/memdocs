# How to monitor co-management in Configuration Manager

*Applies to: Configuration Manager (current branch)*

After you enable co-management, monitor co-management devices using the following methods:

- [Co-management dashboard](#co-management-dashboard)  

- [Deployment policies](#deployment-policies)

- [WMI device data](#wmi-device-data)

## Co-management dashboard

This dashboard helps you review machines that are co-managed in your environment. The graphs can help identify devices that might need attention.<!--1356648,1358980-->

In the Configuration Manager console, go to the **Monitoring** workspace, and select the **Cloud Attach** node.
   - For version 2103 and earlier, select the **Co-management** node.

### Client OS distribution

Shows the number of client devices per OS by version. It uses the following groupings:  

- Windows 7 & 8.x
- Windows 10 lower than 1709  
- Windows 10 1709 and later  


Hover over a graph section to show the percentage of devices in that OS group.

### Co-management status

A funnel chart that shows the number of devices with the following states from the enrollment process:
  
- Eligible devices
- Scheduled  
- Enrollment initiated  
- Enrolled  

![Co-management status (funnel) tile](media/co-management-dashboard/1358980-status-funnel.png)

### Co-management enrollment status

Shows the breakdown of device status in the following categories:

- Success, Microsoft Entra hybrid joined  
- Success, Microsoft Entra joined  
- Enrolling, Microsoft Entra hybrid joined  
- Failure, Microsoft Entra hybrid joined  
- Failure, Microsoft Entra joined  
- Pending user sign in  
   - To reduce the number of devices in this pending state, a new co-managed device automatically enrolls to the Microsoft Intune service based on its Microsoft Entra ID *device* token. It doesn't need to wait for a user to sign in to the device for auto-enrollment to start. To support this behavior, the device needs to be running Windows 10, version 1803 or later. If the device token fails, it falls back to previous behavior with the user token. Look in the **ComanagementHandler.log** for the following entry:
    > `Enrolling device with RegisterDeviceWithManagementUsingAADDeviceCredentials`

Select a state in the tile to drill through to a list of devices in that state.

### Workload transition

Displays a bar chart with the number of devices that you've transitioned to Microsoft Intune for the available workloads. For more information, see [Workloads able to be transitioned to Intune](workloads.md).

Hover over a chart section to show the number of devices transitioned for the workload.

### Enrollment errors

This table is a list of enrollment errors from devices. These errors can come from the MDM component in Windows, the core Windows OS, or the Configuration Manager client.

There are hundreds of possible errors. The following table lists the most common errors.
<!-- SCCMDocs issue 1064, BUG 3158555 -->

## Deployment policies

Two policies are created in the **Deployments** node of the **Monitoring** workspace. One policy is for the pilot group and one for production. These policies report only the number of devices where Configuration Manager has applied the policy. They don't consider how many devices are enrolled in Intune, which is a requirement before devices can be co-managed.

The production policy (CoMgmtSettingsProd) is targeted to the **All Systems** collection. It has an applicability condition that checks the OS type and version. If the client runs a server OS or isn't Windows 10 or later, the policy doesn't apply, and no action is taken.

> [!TIP]
> For an example collection query for co-managed devices see, [Create queries in Configuration Manager](../core/servers/manage/create-queries.md#bkmk_comgmt).
 
## WMI device data

Query the **SMS_Client_ComanagementState** WMI class in the **ROOT\SMS\site_&lt;SITECODE>** namespace on the site server. You can create custom collections in Configuration Manager, which help determine the status of your co-management deployment. For more information on creating custom collections, see [How to create collections](../core/clients/manage/collections/create-collections.md).

The following fields are available in the WMI class:

- **MachineId**: A unique device ID for the Configuration Manager client

- **MDMEnrolled**: Specifies whether the device is MDM-enrolled

- **Authority**: The authority for which the device is enrolled

- **ComgmtPolicyPresent**: Specifies whether the Configuration Manager co-management policy exists on the client. If the **MDMEnrolled** value is `0`, the device isn't co-managed whatever co-management policy exists on the client.

A device is co-managed when the **MDMEnrolled** field and **ComgmtPolicyPresent** fields both have a value of `1`.
