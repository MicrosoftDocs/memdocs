# How to monitor co-management in Configuration Manager

*Applies to: Configuration Manager (current branch)*

After you enable co-management, monitor co-management devices using the following methods:

- [Co-management dashboard](#co-management-dashboard)  

- [Deployment policies](#deployment-policies)

- [WMI device data](#wmi-device-data)

## Co-management dashboard

Starting in version 1802, view a dashboard with information about co-management. The dashboard helps you review machines that are co-managed in your environment. The graphs can help identify devices that might need attention.<!--1356648-->

In the Configuration Manager console, go to the **Monitoring** workspace, and select the **Co-management** node.

Starting in version 1810, the co-management dashboard is enhanced with more detailed information. <!--1358980-->

### Co-managed devices

*Applies to versions 1802 and 1806*

Shows the percentage of co-managed devices throughout your environment.

![Co-managed devices tile](media/co-management-dashboard/Percent-Co-managed-graph.PNG)

### Client OS distribution

*Applies to all versions* 

Shows the number of client devices per OS by version. It uses the following groupings:  

- Windows 7 & 8.x
- Windows 10 lower than 1709  
- Windows 10 1709 and above  

    > [!Tip]  
    > Windows 10, version 1709 and later, is a prerequisite for co-management.  

Hover over a graph section to show the percentage of devices in that OS group.

### Co-management status (donut)

*Applies to versions 1802 and 1806*

Shows the breakdown of device success or failure in the following categories:

- Success, hybrid Azure AD Joined
- Success, Azure AD Joined  
- Failure: Auto-enrollment failed  

Hover over a graph section to show the percentage of devices in that category.

Select a graph section to view the device list for that category.

### Co-management status (funnel)

*Applies to version 1810 and later*

A funnel chart that shows the number of devices with the following states from the enrollment process:
  
- Eligible devices
- Scheduled  
- Enrollment initiated  
- Enrolled  

![Co-management status (funnel) tile](media/co-management-dashboard/1358980-status-funnel.png)

### Co-management enrollment status

*Applies to version 1810 and later*

Shows the breakdown of device status in the following categories:

- Success, hybrid Azure AD-joined  
- Success, Azure AD-joined  
- Enrolling, hybrid Azure AD-joined  
- Failure, hybrid Azure AD-joined  
- Failure, Azure AD-joined  
- Pending user sign in  

    > [!Note]  
    > Starting in version 1906, to reduce the number of devices in this pending state, a new co-managed device now automatically enrolls to the Microsoft Intune service based on its Azure AD *device* token. It doesn't need to wait for a user to sign in to the device for auto-enrollment to start. To support this behavior, the device needs to be running Windows 10, version 1803 or later.
    >
    > If the device token fails, it falls back to previous behavior with the user token. Look in the **ComanagementHandler.log** for the following entry:
    > `Enrolling device with RegisterDeviceWithManagementUsingAADDeviceCredentials`

Select a state in the tile to drill through to a list of devices in that state.

### Workload transition

*Applies to all versions*

Displays a bar chart with the number of devices that you've transitioned to Microsoft Intune for the available workloads.

The list of workloads varies by version of Configuration Manager. For more information, see [Workloads able to be transitioned to Intune](workloads.md).

Hover over a chart section to show the number of devices transitioned for the workload.

### Enrollment errors

*Applies to version 1810 and later*

This table is a list of enrollment errors from devices. These errors can come from the MDM component in Windows, the core Windows OS, or the Configuration Manager client.

There are hundreds of possible errors. The following table lists the most common errors.
<!-- SCCMDocs issue 1064, BUG 3158555 -->

## Deployment policies

Two policies are created in the **Deployments** node of the **Monitoring** workspace. One policy is for the pilot group and one for production. These policies report only the number of devices where Configuration Manager has applied the policy. They don't consider how many devices are enrolled in Intune, which is a requirement before devices can be co-managed.  

The production policy (CoMgmtSettingsProd) is targeted to the **All Systems** collection. It has an applicability condition that checks the OS type and version. If the client is a server OS or not Windows 10, the policy doesn't apply, and no action is taken.

## WMI device data

Query the **SMS_Client_ComanagementState** WMI class. You can create custom collections in Configuration Manager, which help determine the status of your co-management deployment. For more information on creating custom collections, see [How to create collections](../core/clients/manage/collections/create-collections.md).

The following fields are available in the WMI class:  

- **MachineId**: A unique device ID for the Configuration Manager client  

- **MDMEnrolled**: Specifies whether the device is MDM-enrolled  

- **Authority**: The authority for which the device is enrolled  

- **ComgmtPolicyPresent**: Specifies whether the Configuration Manager co-management policy exists on the client. If the **MDMEnrolled** value is **0**, the device isn't co-managed regardless whether the co-management policy exists on the client.  

A device is co-managed when the **MDMEnrolled** field and **ComgmtPolicyPresent** fields both have a value of **1**.
