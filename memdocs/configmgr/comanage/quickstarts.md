# Cloud connecting with co-management

![Blastoff series banner](media/blastoff-banner.png)

Co-management adds new functionality to your existing Configuration Manager deployment, without changing how you already work. When you enable co-management, you immediately begin benefitting from the cloud. You can apply that value to your existing management infrastructure and processes.

In this co-management quickstart series, see how you can quickly drive new management value. Co-management is built to create features and tools you can use right now.

In the following video, Microsoft corporate vice president Brad Anderson introduces this co-management series:
