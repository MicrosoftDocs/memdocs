# Cloud connecting with co-management

![Blastoff series banner.](media/blastoff-banner.png)

In this co-management quickstart series, see how you can quickly drive new management value. Co-management is built to create features and tools you can use right now.

In the following video, Microsoft corporate vice president Brad Anderson introduces this co-management series:

|-|-|-|
| <a name="bkmk_paths"></a>**Paths to co-management** | There are two primary ways for you to set up co-management, and it's important to understand the prerequisites for each path.  Each path requires some combination of Microsoft Entra ID, ConfigMgr, Intune, and Windows client. | [Learn more about paths to co-management.](quickstart-paths.md) |
| <a name="bkmk_setup-hybrid-aad"></a>**Set up hybrid Microsoft Entra ID** | If your environment currently has domain-joined Windows 10 or later devices, set up hybrid Microsoft Entra ID before you can enable co-management. | [![Thumbnail of hybrid Microsoft Entra ID set up video.](media/thumbnail-setup-azure-ad.png)](quickstart-setup-hybrid-aad.md) |
| <a name="bkmk_upgrade-win10"></a>**Upgrade Windows** | A supported version of Windows 10 or later is required for co-management. | [![Thumbnail of upgrade Windows 10 video.](media/thumbnail-upgrade-win10.png)](quickstart-upgrade-win10.md) |
