1. In the Configuration Manager console, go to the **Administration** workspace, expand **Cloud Services**, and select the **Co-management** node. Click **Configure co-management** in the ribbon to open the **Co-management Configuration Wizard**.

2. On the **Subscription** page of the wizard, select **Sign In**. Sign in to your Intune tenant, and then select **Next**.  

3. On the **Enablement** page, choose your **Automatic enrollment into Intune** setting, either **Pilot** or **All**. If a device is  unenrolled by the user, on the next evaluation of the policy, it will re-enroll. <!--3330596--> 

    This action enables automatic client enrollment in Intune for existing Configuration Manager clients. When you choose **Pilot**, only the Configuration Manager clients that are members of the pilot collection are automatically enrolled to Intune. This option allows you to enable co-management on a subset of clients to initially test co-management, and rollout co-management using a phased approach. 

    > [!Note]  
    > Starting in version 1806, automatic enrollment isn't immediate for all clients. This behavior helps enrollment scale better for large environments. Configuration Manager randomizes enrollment based on the number of clients. For example, if your environment has 100,000 clients, when you enable this setting, enrollment occurs over several days.<!--1358003-->  

4. For internet-based devices that are already enrolled in Intune, copy and save the command line on the **Enablement** page. You can use this command line to install the Configuration Manager client as an app in Intune. If you don't save this command line now, you can review the co-management configuration at any time to get this command line.

5. On the **Workloads** page, for each workload, choose which device group to move over for management with Intune. For more information, see [Workloads](../workloads.md).  

    If you only want to enable co-management, you don't need to switch workloads now. You can switch workloads later. For more information, see [How to switch workloads](../how-to-switch-workloads.md).  

    The **Pilot Intune** setting switches the associated workload only for the devices in the pilot collection. The **Intune** setting switches the associated workload for all co-managed Windows 10 devices.  

    > [!Important]
    > Before you switch any workloads, make sure you properly configure and deploy the corresponding workload in Intune. Make sure that workloads are always managed by one of the management tools for your devices.  

6. On the **Staging** page, configure the following settings:  

    - **Pilot**: The pilot group contains one or more collections that you select. Use this group as part of your phased rollout of co-management. Start with a small test collection, and then add more collections to the pilot group as you roll out co-management to more users and devices. You can change the collections in the pilot group at any time.  

    - **Production**: Configure the **Exclusion group** with one or more collections. Devices that are members of any of the collections in this group are excluded from using co-management.  

7. To enable co-management, complete the wizard.
