# Create configuration items for Windows devices with on-premises MDM in Configuration Manager

*Applies to: Configuration Manager (current branch)*

Use the Configuration Manager **Windows 8.1 and Windows 10** configuration item to manage settings for Windows devices that you manage with on-premises mobile device management (MDM).

For more general information on compliance settings in Configuration Manager, see the following articles:

- [Get started with compliance settings](../../compliance/get-started/get-started-with-compliance-settings.md)

- [Plan for and configure compliance settings](../../compliance/plan-design/plan-for-and-configure-compliance-settings.md)

## Create a configuration item

1. In the Configuration Manager console, go to the **Assets and compliance** workspace, expand **Compliance Settings**, and then select the **Configuration Items** node.

1. On the **Home** tab of the ribbon, in the **Create** group, select **Create Configuration Item**.

1. On the **General** page of the **Create Configuration Item Wizard**, specify the following information:

    - **Name**: A unique name to identify this configuration item.

    - **Description**: An optional description to provide further information about its use.

    - Under **Settings for devices managed *without* the Configuration Manager client**, select **Windows 8.1 and Windows 10**.

    - **Categories**: You can create and assign categories to help you search and filter configuration items in the Configuration Manager console.

1. On the **Supported Platforms** page of the wizard, select the specific Windows platforms to evaluate this configuration item.

1. On the **Device Settings** page, select the settings groups that you want to configure. For more information on the available settings, see [Settings reference](#bkmk_setref).

    > [!TIP]
    > If the setting that you want isn't listed, select the option to **Configure additional settings that are not in the default setting groups**. This option adds the **Additional Settings** page to the wizard.

1. On each settings page, configure the necessary settings. When the settings support it, you can also **Remediate noncompliant settings**. If a device evaluates the setting as not compliant with this configuration item, it will remediate the setting to be compliant.

    For each settings group, you can also configure the severity that it reports when the setting is noncompliant. Choose one of the following values for the **Noncompliance severity for reports** option:

    - **None**: Devices that fail this compliance rule don't report a failure severity for Configuration Manager reports.

    - **Information**

    - **Warning**

    - **Critical**

    - **Critical with event**: Devices that fail this compliance rule report a failure severity of **Critical** for Configuration Manager reports. It also logs the noncompliant state as a Windows event in the application event log.

1. On the **Platform Applicability** page of the wizard, review any settings that aren't compatible with the selected supported platforms. Go back and remove these settings, change the support platforms, or continue.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > Devices don't assess the compliance of unsupported settings.

1. Complete the wizard.

You can view the new configuration item in the **Configuration Items** node of the **Assets and Compliance** workspace.
