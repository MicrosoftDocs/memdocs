# Manage devices and protect data with on-premises MDM in Configuration Manager

*Applies to: Configuration Manager (current branch)*

Mobile devices can store sensitive data and provide easy access to many organizational resources. To help protect devices and data, use Configuration Manager for the following device management actions:

- **Full wipe**: Restore the device to its factory settings

- **Selective wipe**: Remove only organizational data

- **Passcode reset**: Remove or reset the passcode when a user forgets it

- **Remote lock**: Help secure a device that might be lost

## Full wipe  

When you need to secure a lost device or when you retire a device from active use, you can start a full wipe on it. This action restores the device to its factory defaults. It removes all organizational and user data and settings.

1. In the Configuration Manager console, go to the **Assets and Compliance** workspace, and choose the **Devices** node. You can also choose **Device Collections** and select a collection of which the device is a member.

1. Select the device that you want to wipe.

1. On the ribbon, in the Device group, select **Remote Device Actions**, and then choose **Retire/Wipe**.

1. In the **Retire from Configuration Manager** window, select the option to **Wipe the mobile device and retire it from Configuration Manager**.

## Selective wipe

To remove only organizational data from a device, start a selective wipe.

### Behaviors by OS version

The following tables describe what data is removed and the effect on data that remains on the device after a selective wipe.

## Passcode reset

If a user forgets their passcode, use this action to force a new temporary passcode on the device. You can also remove the passcode entirely. The following table lists how passcode reset works on different mobile platforms.

| Windows Phone 8 and Windows Phone 8.1 | Supported |
| Windows RT 8.1 | Not supported |
| Windows 8.1 | Not supported |

> [!Note]
> Start the passcode reset action from the top-level site. For example, if you use a central administration site, you can only do the action on that site. If you're using a standalone primary site, you can only do the action from that site.
