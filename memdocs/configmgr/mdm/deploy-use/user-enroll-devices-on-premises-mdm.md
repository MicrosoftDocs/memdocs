# How users enroll devices with on-premises MDM in Configuration Manager

*Applies to: Configuration Manager (current branch)*

With Configuration Manager on-premises mobile device management (MDM), users can enroll their devices. There are two prerequisites:

- With client settings, you grant the user permission to enroll.

- You install the required trusted root certificate on the device.

For more information on how to set up enrollment, see [Set up device enrollment for on-premises MDM](../get-started/set-up-device-enrollment-on-premises-mdm.md).

1. On a Windows 10 computer, go to **Settings**.

1. Select **Accounts**, and then select **Access work or school**.

1. Select **Connect**, enter your user principal name (UPN), and select **Continue**. The UPN may be the same as your email address, for example, jdoe@contoso.com.

1. Enter the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the enrollment proxy point, and select **Continue**.
