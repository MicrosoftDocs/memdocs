# Create configuration items in Configuration Manager

*Applies to: Configuration Manager (current branch)*

Compliance settings in Configuration Manager let you create and deploy configurations to both devices that are managed by Configuration Manager, and devices that are enrolled with Microsoft Intune.

## Configuration items for devices managed with the Configuration Manager client

Before you start, read [Get started with compliance settings](../../compliance/get-started/get-started-with-compliance-settings.md). To learn some basics about compliance settings, read [Plan for and configure compliance settings](../../compliance/plan-design/plan-for-and-configure-compliance-settings.md) to implement any necessary prerequisites. In each scenario, you'll create a configuration item that does a specific task.
