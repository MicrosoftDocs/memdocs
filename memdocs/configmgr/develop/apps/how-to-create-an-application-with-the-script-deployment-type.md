# How to Create an Application with the Script Deployment Type
Applications are new to Configuration Manager.  Prior to Configuration Manager, a package was the basic object that was used to install software.  Now, a more flexible and complete model exists for applications in Configuration Manager.  Software based on this new model are referred to as Applications.  Packages still exist in Configuration Manager, but they are defined and behave in much the same manner as packages did in Configuration Manager.  

 The application model defines a standard set of properties and metadata that is used by the system to manage the lifecycle of the application. As applications are modeled, the application itself can be a building block used to help define other applications in the system. For example, .NET Framework can be defined as an application, and then it can be referenced by a parent application as a dependency that must be present or installed before the parent application is installed.  

## To Create an Application with the Script Deployment Type  
 In order to get started with creating an application, the following section defines a simple application and its basic properties.  Assuming that all applications you create are new from the Configuration Manager perspective, then adding a new application into Configuration Manager is relatively straightforward. When applications may already exist, and may have relationships to other applications, either through dependencies or supersedence is more complicated and not covered in the example below.  

 A simple command line program that demonstrates the how to create the model and persist to the database through the SMS Provider is shown below. As a sample, it contains strings that are hard-coded, and should not be considered a real world application for automating application creation. Additionally, there is minimal error handling. However, this example should be enough to get you started.

    Demonstrates how to create an application-supersedence relationship between two versions of an application. For more information, see [Configuration Manager SDK samples](../../develop/core/understand/configuration-manager-sdk-samples.md).

- **SDK Sample: DTRequirements**  

    Demonstrates how to create deployment type requirements and add them to a deployment type. For more information, see [Configuration Manager SDK Samples](../../develop/core/understand/configuration-manager-sdk-samples.md).

##### To Create an Application with the Script Deployment Type  

1. Initialize the provider connection and ApplicationFactory. (The application factory is a wrapper that makes creating the provider classes a little easier.)  

2. Create the application and the deployment type.  

3. Persist the application to the provider.  

   To use this sample, create a new command line C# application and copy and replace the code shown. You'll need to add references to the 5 assemblies below are all found in the adminconsole\bin directory:  

- AdminUI.AppManFoundation.dll  

   A wrapper encapsulating Configuration Manager provider functionality for creating applications.  

- AdminUI.WqlQueryEngine.dll  

   The WqlConnectionManager.  

- Microsoft.ConfigurationManagement.ApplicationManagement.dll  

   The core application model, used to serialize/deserialize applications.  

- Microsoft.ConfigurationManagement.ApplicationManagement.MsiInstaller.dll  

   An implementation of the Windows Installer and Script Deployment Types.  

- Microsoft.ConfigurationManagement.ManagementProvider.dll  

   The Configuration Manager managed WMI interface.  

  After compiling and running the application, the output for the application will show this when it is successful.  

```  
C:\sms\AdminConsole\bin>ApplicationCreator.exe  

Connecting to the SMS Provider on computer [machinename].  
Initializing the ApplicationFactory.Creating application [app].  
Creating Script DeploymentType.  
Initializing the SMS_Application object with the model.  
Saving application, Title: [app], Scope: [ScopeId_D5230FF0-B439-44D9-906E-00A330F2AE06].  
Successfully saved application.  
```  

## Example

The following example method creates an application with the script deployment type and persists into the Configuration Manager database.

> This code is a sample. It doesn't contain error handling for all cases, nor demonstrate relationships such as dependencies and supersedence. It also doesn't demonstrate creating requirement rules for a deployment type.
