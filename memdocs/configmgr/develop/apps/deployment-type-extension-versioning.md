# Deployment Type Extension Versioning
Configuration Manager supports in-place versioning for minor upgrades and out-of-place versioning for major upgrades.  

## Versioning  

### Minor Revisions  
 Configuration Manager supports in-place versioning for minor upgrades that are backwards compatible. For in-place versioning, increment the version number.  

### Major Revisions  
 Configuration Manager supports out-of-place versioning for major upgrades that aren't backwards compatible. For out-of-place versioning, it's necessary to create a new extension and technology ID.
