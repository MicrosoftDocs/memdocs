# How to Delete a Driver Package in Configuration Manager
You delete an operating system deployment driver package, in Configuration Manager, by deleting its [SMS_DriverPackage](../../develop/reference/osd/sms_driverpackage-server-wmi-class.md) object.  

> [!NOTE]
>  Windows drivers that are referenced by the driver package are not deleted.  

### To delete a driver package  

1.  Set up a connection to the SMS Provider. For more information, see [SMS Provider fundamentals](../core/understand/sms-provider-fundamentals.md).  

2.  Get the [SMS_DriverPackage](../../develop/reference/osd/sms_driverpackage-server-wmi-class.md) object for the driver that you want to delete.  

3.  Delete the SMS_DriverPackage object.  

## Example  
 The following example method deletes a driver package identified by its package identifier.  

 For information about calling the sample code, see [Calling Configuration Manager Code Snippets](../../develop/core/understand/calling-code-snippets.md).  

```vbs  
Sub DeleteDriverPackage(connection,packageID)  

        ' Get the driver.  
        Set driverPackage = connection.Get("SMS_DriverPackage.PackageID='" & packageID & "'")  

        ' Delete the driver package.  
        driverPackage.Delete_  

End Sub  
```  

```c#  
public void DeleteDriverPackage(  
    WqlConnectionManager connection,   
    string packageId)  
{  
    try  
    {  
        // Get the driver package.  
        IResultObject driverPackage = connection.GetInstance("SMS_DriverPackage.packageId='" + packageId + "'");  

        // Delete the driver package.  
        driverPackage.Delete();  
    }  
    catch (SmsException e)  
    {  
        Console.WriteLine("Failed to delete driver package: " + e.Message);  
        throw;  
    }  
}  
```  

 The example method has the following parameters:  

|Parameter|Type|Description|  
|---------------|----------|-----------------|  
|`Connection`|-   Managed:`WqlConnectionManager`<br />-   VBScript: [SWbemServices](/windows/win32/wmisdk/swbemservices)|A valid connection to the SMS Provider.|  
|`packageID`|-   Managed: `String`<br />-   VBScript: `String`|-   The driver package identifier available in SMS_DriverDriverPackage.PackageID.|
