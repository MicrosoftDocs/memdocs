# How to Set the Response Delay for a PXE Service Point
In Configuration Manager, you set the operating system deployment PXE service point response delay by updating the *ResponseDelay* embedded property. *ResponseDelay* specifies how long the delay should be for this PXE service point before it responds to computer requests when multiple PXE service points are used. By default, the Configuration Manager PXE service point will respond immediately to the network PXE requests.  

 The delay is provided by the PXE client, and it shows the time that has passed since the client started the PXE boot process (seconds elapsed since client began address acquisition or renewal process). A client sends requests to the server at intervals of 0 (default), 4, 8, 16, or 32 seconds.  

### To set the response delay for a PXE service point  

1.  Set up a connection to the SMS Provider. For more information, see [SMS Provider fundamentals](../core/understand/sms-provider-fundamentals.md).  

2.  Make a connection to the distribution point instance with PXE enabled.  

3.  Get the embedded properties.  

4.  Update the *ResponseDelay* embedded property.  

5.  Commit the changes to the site control file.  

## Example  
 The following example method sets the response delay for a PXE service point.  

 For information about calling the sample code, see [Calling Configuration Manager Code Snippets](../../develop/core/understand/calling-code-snippets.md).  

```c#  
public void SetResponseDelay(WqlConnectionManager connection,                                  string siteCode,                                  string serverName,                                  int delay){    try    {        //Connect to distribution point instance.                        IResultObject siteRole = connection.GetInstance("SMS_SCI_SysResUse.FileType=2,ItemName=\"[\\\"Display=\\\\\\\\" + serverName + "\\\\\\\"]MSWNET:[\\\"SMS_SITE=" + siteCode + "\\\"]\\\\\\\\" + serverName + "\\\\,SMS Distribution Point\",ItemType=\"System Resource Usage\",SiteCode=" + "\"" + siteCode + "\"");        // Create temporary copy of the embedded properties.        Dictionary<string, IResultObject> embeddedProperties = siteRole.EmbeddedProperties;        // Enumerate through the embedded properties and makes changes as needed.        foreach (KeyValuePair<string, IResultObject> kvp in siteRole.EmbeddedProperties)        {            // Setting: ResponseDelay            if (kvp.Value.PropertyList["PropertyName"] == "ResponseDelay")            {                // Get current property value.                Console.WriteLine();                Console.WriteLine("Property: {0}", kvp.Value.PropertyList["PropertyName"]);                Console.WriteLine("Current value: {0}", kvp.Value.PropertyList["Value"]);                // Change value.                embeddedProperties["ResponseDelay"]["Value"].IntegerValue = delay;                Console.WriteLine("Setting the {0} value to {1}.", kvp.Value.PropertyList["PropertyName"], delay);            }        }        // Store the settings that have changed.        siteRole.EmbeddedProperties = embeddedProperties;        // Save the settings.         siteRole.Put();    }    catch (SmsException ex)    {        Console.WriteLine();        Console.WriteLine("Failed. Error: " + ex.InnerException.Message);    }}  
```  

 The example method has the following parameters:  

|Parameter|Type|Description|
|-|-|-|
|`connection`|Managed: `WqlConnectionManager`|A valid connection to the SMS Provider.|  
|`siteCode`|Managed: `String`|The Configuration Manager site code.|  
|`serverName`|Managed: `String`|The server name. For example, `"SERVER1.DOMAIN1.COM"`.|  
|delay|Managed: `Integer`|The delay, in seconds.|
