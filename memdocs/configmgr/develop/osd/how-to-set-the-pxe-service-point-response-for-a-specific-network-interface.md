# How to Set the PXE Service Point Response for a Specific Network Interface
In Configuration Manager, you set the operating system deployment to respond to a specific set of network addresses by adding the required media access control (MAC) addresses to the `BindExcept` embedded property list. You must also set the `BindPolicy` embedded property to 1. This specifies that PXE requests are accepted on specified network address only. For more information about setting `BindPolicy`, see [How to Set the PXE Service Point Response to All Network Interfaces](../../develop/osd/how-to-set-the-pxe-service-point-response-to-all-network-interfaces.md).  

### To set the response for a specific network interface  

1.  Set up a connection to the SMS Provider. For more information, see [SMS Provider fundamentals](../core/understand/sms-provider-fundamentals.md).  

2.  Make a connection to the PXE service point resources section of the site control file.  

3.  Get the `BindExcept` embedded property list.  

4.  Add the MAC addresses to the `BindExcept` embedded property list.  

5.  Commit the changes to the site control file.  

## Example  
 The following example method adds a supplied MAC address to the list of MAC address that are responded to.  

 For information about calling the sample code, see [Calling Configuration Manager Code Snippets](../../develop/core/understand/calling-code-snippets.md).  

```c#  
public void SetNetworkInterface(WqlConnectionManager connection,                                string siteCode,                                string serverName,                                string macAddress){    try    {        //Connect to distribution point instance.                        IResultObject siteRole = connection.GetInstance("SMS_SCI_SysResUse.FileType=2,ItemName=\"[\\\"Display=\\\\\\\\" + serverName + "\\\\\\\"]MSWNET:[\\\"SMS_SITE=" + siteCode + "\\\"]\\\\\\\\" + serverName + "\\\\,SMS Distribution Point\",ItemType=\"System Resource Usage\",SiteCode=" + "\"" + siteCode + "\"");        // Create temporary copy of the embedded properties.        Dictionary<string, IResultObject> embeddedPropertyLists = siteRole.EmbeddedPropertyLists;        // Get current mac addresses.        string[] macAddresses = embeddedPropertyLists["BindExcept"]["Values"].StringArrayValue;        //Convert to list.        List<string> addressList = new List<string>();        foreach (string address in macAddresses)        {            addressList.Add(address);        }        // Add the new mac address to the list.        addressList.Add(macAddress);        // Add the new mac address to the list.        embeddedPropertyLists["BindExcept"]["Values"].StringArrayValue = addressList.ToArray();        siteRole.EmbeddedPropertyLists = embeddedPropertyLists;        // Save the settings.         siteRole.Put();    }    catch (SmsException ex)    {        Console.WriteLine();        Console.WriteLine("Failed. Error: " + ex.InnerException.Message);    }}  
```  

 The example method has the following parameters:  

|Parameter|Type|Description|
|-|-|-|
|`connection`|-   Managed:  `WqlConnectionManager`|A valid connection to the SMS Provider.|  
|`serverName`|-   Managed: `String`|The Configuration Manager server.|  
|`siteCode`|-   Managed: `String`|The Configuration Manager site code.|  
|`macAddress`|-   Managed: `String`|The MAC address to be added in the following format:<br /><br /> 00:11:22:33:44:55|  

## Compiling the Code
