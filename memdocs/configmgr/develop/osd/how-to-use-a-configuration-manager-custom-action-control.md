# How to Use a Configuration Manager Custom Action Control
In Configuration Manager, you use a custom action control by selecting it in the Configuration Manager console Task Sequence Editor. The custom action control is used to configure a custom action that you have defined. The custom action is then becomes a step in the task sequence you are editing. The following procedure assumes that you have completed the tasks in the following topics:  

 [How to Create a Configuration Manager Custom Action Control](../../develop/osd/how-to-create-a-configuration-manager-custom-action-control.md)  

 [How to Create a MOF File for a Configuration Manager Custom Action](../../develop/osd/how-to-create-a-mof-file-for-a-configuration-manager-custom-action.md)  

 The following procedure demonstrates the custom action control saving its properties and reloading them the next time that the action is edited.  

 To use the custom action as part of the sequence that contains it, you will need to advertise it using a Configuration Manager task sequence package. For more information, see [About Configuration Manager Custom Action Client Applications](../../develop/osd/about-configuration-manager-custom-action-client-applications.md)  

> [!NOTE]
>  Step 1 and step 2 are only necessary if the action control Managed Object Format (MOF) file or assembly has been changed.
