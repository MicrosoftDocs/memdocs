# Privacy Information
The Configuration Manager SDK provides documentation and code samples demonstrating how to programmatically access Configuration Manager features. When you build a program or script by using the Configuration Manager SDK, Configuration Manager does not limit the types of information it transmits. For example, a program that identifies each computer and logon account could be used to transmit information between clients and servers.  

 No information is sent back to Microsoft by the Configuration Manager SDK unless you choose to send it to Microsoft.  

 Before writing any scripts or programs that are based on the information in the Configuration Manager SDK, consider your privacy requirements.
