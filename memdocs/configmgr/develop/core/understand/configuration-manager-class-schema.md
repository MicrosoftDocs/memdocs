# Configuration Manager Class Schema
The Systems Management Server (SMS) class schema is a set of Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) classes that represent the objects in SMS. Each SMS class is a template for a managed object and all instances of the object use the template. Classes can contain properties and methods: the properties describe the class data and the methods typically perform data management for the class.

## Class categories

The following table describes the categories of classes and how the classes are used.  

|Category|Description|  
|--------------|-----------------|  
|Server|Classes supported on servers running SMS.|  
|Advanced Client|Classes supported on SMS Advanced Clients.|
