# How to Delete a Configuration Manager Object by Using WMI
To delete a Configuration Manager object, in Configuration Manager, call the [SWbemObject](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/aa393741.aspx) object [Delete_](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/aa393771.aspx) method.  

### To delete a Configuration Manager object  

1.  Set up a connection to the SMS Provider. For more information, see [How to Connect to an SMS Provider in Configuration Manager by Using WMI](../../../develop/core/understand/how-to-connect-to-an-sms-provider-in-configuration-manager-by-using-wmi.md).  

2.  Using the [SWbemServices](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/win32/wmisdk/swbemservices) object you obtain from step one, call the [Get](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/aa393868.aspx) method and specify the class and key information for the object you want to delete. `Get` returns a `SWbemObject` that represents the object.  

3.  Using the `SWbemObject`, call `Delete` to delete the object.  

## Example  
 The following VBScript code example deletes the package ([SMS_Package](../../../develop/reference/core/servers/configure/sms_package-server-wmi-class.md)) identified by its package identifier `packageID`.  

 For information about calling the sample code, see [Calling Configuration Manager Code Snippets](../../../develop/core/understand/calling-code-snippets.md).  

```vbs  
Sub DeletePackage (connection, packageID)  

    On Error Resume Next   
    Dim package  

    Set package = connection.Get("SMS_Package.PackageID='" & packageID & "'")  
    If Err.Number<>0 Then  
        Wscript.Echo "Couldn't get package " + packageID  
        Exit Sub  
    End If  

    package.Delete_  

    WScript.Echo "Package deleted"  

    If Err.Number<>0 Then  
        Wscript.Echo "Couldn't delete " + packageID  
        Exit Sub  
    End If  

End Sub  

```  

 This example method has the following parameters:  

|Parameter|Type|Description|  
|---------------|----------|-----------------|  
|`connection`|`SWbemServices`|A valid connection to the SMS Provider.|  
|`packageID`|`String`|The package identifier. This is obtained from the `SMS_Package` class `PackageID`.|
