# How to Perform an Asynchronous Configuration Manager Query by Using WMI
In Configuration Manager, you perform an synchronous query for Configuration Manager objects by calling the [SWbemServices](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/win32/wmisdk/swbemservices) object [ExecQueryAsync](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/aa392108.aspx) method and by implementing a sink method to handle query results.  

 To handle each returned object, create an [objWbemSink.OnObjectReady](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/aa393881.aspx) event subroutine. To be notified when the query is completed, create a [objWbemSink.OnCompleted](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/aa393879.aspx) event subroutine.  

> [!NOTE]
>  Lazy properties are not returned in asynchronous queries. For more information, see [How to Read Lazy Properties by Using WMI](../../../develop/core/understand/how-to-read-lazy-properties-by-using-wmi.md).  

### To perform an asynchronous query  

1.  Set up a connection to the SMS Provider. For more information, see [How to Connect to an SMS Provider in Configuration Manager by Using WMI](../../../develop/core/understand/how-to-connect-to-an-sms-provider-in-configuration-manager-by-using-wmi.md).  

2.  Create an [OnObjectReady](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/aa393881.aspx) subroutine to handle objects by the query.  

3.  Create an [OnCompleted](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/aa393879.aspx) subroutine to handle query completion.  

4.  Using the [SWbemServices](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/win32/wmisdk/swbemservices) object you obtain from step one, use [ExecQueryAsync](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/aa392108.aspx) object to query Configuration Manager objects asynchronously.  

## Example  
 The following VBScript code example asynchronously queries for all [SMS_Collection](../../../develop/reference/core/clients/collections/sms_collection-server-wmi-class.md) objects.  

 For information about calling the sample code, see [Calling Configuration Manager Code Snippets](../../../develop/core/understand/calling-code-snippets.md).  

```vbs  
Dim bdone  
Sub QueryCollection(connection)  

    Dim sink  
    bdone = False  

    Set sink = WScript.CreateObject("wbemscripting.swbemsink","sink_")  

    ' Query for all collections.  
    connection.ExecQueryAsync sink, "select * from SMS_Collection"  

    ' Wait until all instances are returned.  
    While Not bdone      
        wscript.sleep 1000  
    Wend  
 End Sub     

' The sink subroutine to handle the OnObjectReady   
' event. This is called as each object returns.  
Sub sink_OnObjectReady(collection, octx)  
    WScript.Echo "CollectionID: " + collection.CollectionID  
    WScript.Echo "Name: " + collection.Name  
    Wscript.Echo  
End Sub  

' The sink subroutine to handle the OnCompleted event.  
' This is called when all the objects are returned.   
' The oErr parameter obtains an SWbemLastError object,  
' if available from the provider.  
Sub sink_OnCompleted(HResult, oErr, oCtx)  
    WScript.Echo "All collections returned"  
    bdone = true  
End Sub  
```  

 This example method has the following parameters:  

|Parameter|Type|Description|  
|---------------|----------|-----------------|  
|`connection`|[SWbemServices](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/win32/wmisdk/swbemservices)|A valid connection to the SMS Provider.|
