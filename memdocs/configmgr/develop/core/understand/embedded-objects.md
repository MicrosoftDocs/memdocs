# Configuration Manager Embedded Objects
Configuration Manager embedded objects do not exist by themselves in the Common Information Model (CIM) repository â€” they exist within other objects. As a result, you cannot use Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) to enumerate, query, get, or put embedded objects. You can only retrieve and store embedded objects through the parent instance.  

 Embedded objects are commonly used when accessing the site control file. In this case, special embedded objects, such as properties and property lists are used.  

 When a class or method contains an embedded object of an abstract type, such as `SMS_ScheduleToken`, you store and retrieve classes that are inherited from it. For example, instead of using `SMS_ScheduleToken`, you use one of the embedded objects inherited from it, such as `SMS_ST_RecurWeekly`.
