# Power management views in Configuration Manager

Information about the power plans applied to computers by Configuration Manager and the power capabilities of computers is retrieved by Configuration Manager hardware inventory.

For more information about power management, see [Power management in Configuration Manager](../../../../core/clients/manage/power/introduction-to-power-management.md).

Wake up proxy is used to supplement the traditional wake-up packet method by using the wake-up proxy client settings. Wake-up proxy uses a peer-to-peer protocol and elected computers to check whether other computers on the subnet are awake, and to wake them if necessary.

For more information about wake up proxy, see the Power Management section of the [About client settings in Configuration Manager](../../../../core/clients/deploy/about-client-settings.md) topic in the Configuration Manager Documentation Library.
