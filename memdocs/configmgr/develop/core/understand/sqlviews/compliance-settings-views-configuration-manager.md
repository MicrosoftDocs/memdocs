# Compliance settings views in Configuration Manager

The Configuration Manager compliance settings views contain information about the compliance of devices with regard to a number of configurations, such as whether the correct Windows operating system versions are installed and configured appropriately, whether all required applications are installed and configured correctly, whether optional applications are configured appropriately, and whether prohibited applications are installed. The compliance settings views contain information about the configuration baselines in the site, which configuration baselines store information about configuration items, software updates, bundles, drivers, and so on. Several of the status and status summarizer views contain status information for the configuration items and configuration item assignments.

The following sections provide detailed information about compliance settings views, compliance settings status views, and compliance settings status summarizer views.

## Compliance settings views

There are many compliance settings views, and it can sometimes be difficult to find the information that you need for your report SQL statement. The following are some of the key compliance settings views and columns:

- **CI_ID** column – Commonly used to join compliance settings views

- **v_ConfigurationItems** view - Used to retrieve information about the configuration items in the site.

- **v_CategoryInfo** and **v_LocalizedCIProperties** views - Often be used to retrieve additional information about the configuration items.

- **AssignmentID** column and the **v_CIAssignment** view - Used to retrieve information about the configuration item deployments.

- **v_CIAssignmentToCI** view - Can be used as the link between the **v_ConfigurationItems** and **v_CIAssignment** views.

- **v_CIAssignmentTargetedMachines** view - can be used as the link between the **v_CIAssignment** view and the views that contain resource information, such as the **v_R_System** view.

The compliance settings views are described in this section.

### v_AssignmentTargetedCIs

Lists the assignment ID, **CI_ID** and unique assignment ID for each deployed configuration item.
This view can be joined to other views by using the **CI_ID** and **AssignmentID** columns.

### v_BaselineTargetedComputers

Lists the clients, by **ResourceID**, to which a configuration baseline has been deployed, by **CI_ID**. This view displays only configuration baselines (**CI_Type = 2**).
This view can be joined to other views by using the **CI_ID** and **ResourceID** columns.

### v_Categories

Lists the configuration item category instances, by **CategoryInstanceID** and **CategoryInstance_UniqueID**, category type name, date the category instance was last modified, source site, and the parent category. This view contains the same source data as the **v_CategoryInstances** view, but it displays more columns.
This view can be joined to other views by using the **CategoryInstanceID** and **ParentCategoryInstanceID** columns.

### v_CategoryInfo

Lists the configuration item category instances, by **CategoryInstanceID** and **CategoryInstance_UniqueID**, category type name, date the category instance was last modified, source site, parent category, category instance name, and locale ID.

For example, configuration items with the Software Updates (CIType_ID = 1) have associated update files, and **Driver** configuration types (CIType_ID = 6) have associated driver files.
The view can be joined to other views by using the **CI_ID** and **Content_ID** columns.

### v_CIContents_All

Lists configuration items that have associated content, by **CI_ID**, the configuration item ID for the configuration item in which the content is associated, the content ID, whether the content has been provisioned, and so on. The configuration item ID for a configuration item bundle is listed multiple times in the **CI_ID** column, and the configuration item IDs for the configuration items that are part of the bundle are listed in the **ContentCI_ID** column. For example, a configuration item that is not a bundle would have the same configuration item ID in the **CI_ID** and **ContentCI_ID** columns. A bundle configuration item would have one listing with the configuration item ID in the **CI_ID** column and the same configuration item ID in the **ContentCI_ID** columns, and then new listings would contain the configuration item ID for the bundle configuration item in the **CI_ID** column and the configuration item ID for the bundled configuration items in the **ContentCI_ID** column. The **ContentLevel** column represents how many times a configuration item ID is listed in the **ContentCI_ID** column.
The view can be joined to other views by using the **CI_ID**, **ContentCI_ID**, and **Content_ID** columns.

### v_CICurrentSettingsComplianceStatusDetail

Lists the configuration items, by **CI_ID**, that are in a configuration baseline, that have been assigned to Configuration Manager clients, and are reporting a validation error or noncompliance. The information includes the NetBIOS name of the client, configuration item name, setting name, setting type, setting description, constraint name, constraint description, and validation rule.
The view can be joined to other views by using the **CI_ID** and **ResourceID** columns.

### v_CIEULA_LocalizedContent

Lists the configuration items, by **CI_ID**, that have associated license terms, as well as the locale ID, the content unique ID for the license terms, the license terms text, and the source site.
The view can be joined to other views by using the **CI_ID** column.

### v_CIRelation

Lists configuration items, by configuration item ID in the **FromCIID** column, the configuration items that are related to the first configuration item, by configuration item ID in the **TOCIID** column, and the type of relation. Configuration items with a bundle level of 1 are listed in the **ToCIID** column. For example, if the configuration item ID for an update bundle is listed in the **FromCIID** column and another update bundle is part of the first bundle, only the configuration item ID for the update bundle will be listed in the **ToCIID** column and not the software updates that are part of the second update bundle.
The view can be joined to other views by using the **FromCIID**, **ToCIID**, and **RelationType** columns. The **FromCIID** column in this view contains the same information as the **CI_ID** column, and the **ToCIID** column contains the same information as the **ReferencedCI_ID** column in the **v_CIRelation_All** view.

> [!NOTE]
> The configuration item relation types can be retrieved from the **v_CIRelationTypes** view.

### v_CIRelation_All

Lists the relationships between configuration items, by **CI_ID**, and other configuration items, by **ReferencedCI_ID**, as well as how deep the relationship is between the configuration items, by level. The **CI_ID** column lists the configuration item to which the configuration item in the **ReferencedCI_ID** is related, such as a software updates bundle and associated software updates that are part of the bundle or a configuration baseline and the associated configuration items that are part of the baseline. Configuration items are also listed with a relationship to themselves, which is indicated by a value of 0.
For example, the configuration item ID for an update bundle is listed in the **CI_ID** column, the same configuration item ID is listed in the **ReferencedCI_ID** column, and the Level is 0. In a different row, a configuration item ID for a different update bundle is listed in the **CI_ID** column, the configuration item ID for the same software update that was part of the previous update bundle is listed in the **ReferencedCI_ID** column because it is also part of this update bundle, and the Level is 1. In a different row, a configuration item ID for an update list is listed in the **CI_ID** column, the configuration item ID for the same software update that was part of the previous update bundle is listed in the **ReferencedCI_ID** column because it is also part of this update list, and the **Level** is 3.
The view can be joined to other views by using the **CI_ID** and **ReferencedCI_ID** columns. The **CI_ID** column in this view is the same as the FromCIID column, and the **ReferencedCI_ID** column is the same as the **ToCIID** column in the **v_CIRelation** and **v_CIRelationEx** views.

> [!NOTE]
> The configuration item relation types can be retrieved from the **v_CIRelationTypes** view.

### v_CIRelationEx

Lists the relationships between configuration items, by **FromCIID**, **TOCIID**, **RelationType**, and **RelationDepth**. The **FromCIID** column is the configuration item to which the configuration item in the ToCIID is related, such as a software updates bundle and associated software updates that are part of the bundle or a configuration baseline and the associated configuration items that are part of the baseline. The **RelationType** column indicates the type of relationship between the configuration items, and the **RelationDepth** column indicates how deep the relationship is for a configuration item listed in the **ToCIID** column. This view does not display configuration items with a **RelationDepth** of 0, which is the relationship of the configuration item to itself.
For example, if the configuration item ID for an update bundle is listed in the **FromCIID** column and the configuration item ID for a software update that is part of the bundle is listed in the **ToCIID** column. The **RelationType** in this case is 1 (Bundled), and the **RelationDepth** is 1. In the next row, a configuration item ID for an update bundle that also contains the previous update is listed in the **FromCIID** column, the same configuration item ID for the update is listed in the **FromCIID** column, the **RelationType** is still 1, and the **RelationDepth** is now 2. In the next row, a configuration item ID for an update list that contains the same update is listed in the **FromCIID** column, the same configuration ID for the update is listed in the **FromCIID** column, the **RelationType** is still 1, and the **RelationDepth** is now 3.
The view can be joined to other views by using the **FromCIID**, ToCIID, and **RelationType** columns. The **FromCIID** column in this view contains the same information as the **CI_ID** column, and the **ToCIID** column contains the same information as the **ReferencedCI_ID** column in the **v_CIRelation_All** view.

> [!NOTE]
> The configuration item relation types can be retrieved from the **v_CIRelationTypes** view.
