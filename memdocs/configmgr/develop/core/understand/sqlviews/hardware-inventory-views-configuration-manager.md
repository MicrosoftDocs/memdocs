# Hardware inventory views in Configuration Manager

The hardware inventory views contain information about the computer hardware scanned on Configuration Manager client computers. Many hardware inventory views are created in Configuration Manager by default, and many more can be enabled or creating classes by using the hardware inventory classes dialog box, accessible from client settings. Because of this, it is likely that Configuration Manager sites collect different hardware inventory resulting in different hardware inventory views.

For more information about extending Configuration Manager hardware inventory, see [How to extend hardware inventory in Configuration Manager](../../../../core/clients/manage/inventory/extend-hardware-inventory.md).

## Hardware inventory schema views

The hardware inventory schema is important to understand when creating queries for Configuration Manager reports. Most of the client data within Configuration Manager is contained in one of the two hardware inventory schema views: **v_GroupMap** and **v_GroupAttributeMap**. The **v_GroupMap** view contains a list of all the hardware inventory groups and the associated view for each of the groups. The **v_GroupAttributeMap** view contains all of the attributes that are inventoried for each of the groups. Both views can be joined together by using the **GroupID** column and joined to the **v_ResourceMap** discovery schema view by using the **ResourceType** column.

Because hardware inventory can be extended, one Configuration Manager site's SQL database might have different hardware inventory views and schema when compared to another site. The following query joins the **v_GroupMap** and **v_GroupAttributeMap** to generate the hardware inventory view schema, based on the specific settings for the site:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT GM.DisplayName, GM.InvClassName,

  GM.InvHistoryClassName, GAM.AttributeName,

  GAM.ColumnName, GM.MIFClass

FROM v_GroupMap GM INNER JOIN v_GroupAttributeMap GAM

  ON GM.GroupID = GAM.GroupID
```

## Hardware inventory views

Most of the hardware inventory views start with the **v_GS_** view name followed by the name of the hardware component, such as CDROM (for example, **v_GS_CDROM**). As a general rule, each hardware inventory view has an associated inventory history view that starts with the **v_HS_** view name. The hardware inventory views can all be joined with other system data views by using the **ResourceID** column, which is demonstrated in Appendix A, in the topic [Sample queries for hardware inventory in Configuration Manager](sample-queries-hardware-inventory-configuration-manager.md). The standard hardware inventory views are described in this section.

> [!NOTE]
> Not all of the items listed are collected by default when using Configuration Manager hardware inventory.
