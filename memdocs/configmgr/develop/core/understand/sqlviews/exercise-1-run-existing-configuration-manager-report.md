# Exercise 1: Run an existing Configuration Manager report

In this exercise, you will run an existing Configuration Manager report and review specific report elements.

For more information about how to work with reports in Configuration Manager, see [Introduction to reporting](../../../../core/servers/manage/introduction-to-reporting.md).

## To run an existing Configuration Manager report

1. In the Configuration Manager console, select **Monitoring**.
1. In the **Monitoring** workspace, expand **Reporting**, and then select **Reports**.
1. In the list of reports, find and select the report, **Processor information for a specific computer**.

   > [!TIP]
   > To make it easier to find a report, you can select a column title to sort the reports, or you can type the name, or a partial name for the report in the search box, and then select **Search**.

1. On the **Home** tab, in the **Report Group** group, select **Run**.
1. Specify any required parameters (in this case, a computer name), and then select **View Report**.

The report is displayed. Review the processor information and then close the report.
