# Status and alert views in Configuration Manager

Configuration Manager status messages report information about Configuration Manager component behavior and data flow and are categorized by severity and type. State messages are sent by Configuration Manager clients to site systems based on important changes of state, providing a snapshot of the state of a process at a specific time. Status summarizers produce summaries of the status and state messages and provide a snapshot of the status and health of site systems, components, software updates compliance, and so on.

Status message instances consist of properties that are stored in the database, which are represented primarily by the **v_StatusMessage** view, and message strings stored in dynamic-link library (DLL) files. When you view a message by using the Configuration Manager console, **Status Message Viewer**, and the **Status Message Details** page in **Report Viewer**, Configuration Manager creates the instance of status messages by combining the various parts.

The following sections provide detailed information about status message views, state message views, and status summarizer views.

## Status message views

The status views are described in this section.

### v_AdvertisementStatusInformation

Lists all deployment status message IDs, the message state, and the message name, such as succeeded, expired, failed, and retrying. The view is also listed and described in the [Application Management Views in Configuration Manager](application-management-views-configuration-manager.md) topic.
The view can be joined to other advertisement status views by using the **MessageID** column.

### v_ClientAdvertisementStatus

Lists all package and program deployments with the associated status for system resources that have been targeted. The view is also listed and described in the [Application Management Views in Configuration Manager](application-management-views-configuration-manager.md) topic.
The view can be joined to other views by using the **AdvertisementID**, **ResourceID**, and **LastStatusMessageID** columns.

### v_ClientMessageStatistics

Lists all Configuration Manager clients, by resource ID, the last time the client sent and processed a status message, and the last time a resynchronization was issued and completed on the client.
This view can be joined to other views by using the **ResourceID** column.

### v_DCMClientStatusInformation

Lists all possible compliance settings client states. The view is also listed and described in the [Compliance Settings Views in Configuration Manager](compliance-settings-views-configuration-manager.md) topic.
It is unlikely that this view will be joined to other views.

### v_PackageStatus

Lists the status for all deployments, as well as the package server location, last update time, and so on. The view is also listed and described in the [Application Management Views in Configuration Manager](application-management-views-configuration-manager.md) topic.
The view can be joined to other views by using the **PackageID** column.

### v_PeerDPStatusInfo

Lists the peer distribution point states and associated state names.
It is unlikely that this view will be joined to other views.

### v_ServerMessageStatistics

Lists the site system servers, the associated site code, when the last heartbeat occurred, and how long the heartbeat took to process. The view is also listed and described in the [Site Administration Views in Configuration Manager](site-admin-views-configuration-manager.md) topic.
The view can be joined to other views by using the **ServerName** column.

### v_StatMsgAttributes

Lists the attributes for all status messages (for example, package ID, collection ID, user name, object GUID, and so on).
The view can be joined to the **v_StatusMessage** and **v_StatMsgInsStrings** views by using the **RecordID** column.

### v_StatMsgInsStrings

This view can be joined to other views by using the **AlertSeverity**, **Name**, **TypeInstanceID** or **MachineName** columns.

## State views

The state views list the state messages sent by Configuration Manager clients to site systems and can generally be joined to system data, other state message views, deployment views, and more. The Configuration Manager states are listed in the **v_StateNames** view. When creating reports by using state views, you will likely want to join the **v_StateNames** view with another state view by using the **StateType** and **StateID** columns to retrieve the friendly names for the state and to use the **v_StateNames** view to determine the criteria to filter the SQL statement. Each state message type has multiple state IDs, which start at 1 for each message type. When joining to a view that contains information for more than one state type, you will need to either join to the other view by using both the **StateType** and **StateID** columns or join to the other view by using the **StateID** column and filter the query with for the specific **StateType**. For example, if you join to another view by using the **StateID** column, you could filter the results by **StateType**=300.

## Status summarizer views

Status summarizers produce summaries from status messages, state messages, and other data in the Configuration Manager site database. Status summaries are produced in real time as the summarizers receive status and state messages from Configuration Manager components and clients. You can use status summarizers to view a snapshot of the status and health of the site systems, components, deployments, software updates compliance, client health, and so on.

Data in a status summary is classified as either a count or a state. A count is a tally of events that occurs over a specific period of time, such as the number of error status messages reported by a component since the beginning of the week. A state is the last known condition of something, such as the number of free bytes that is available for the Configuration Manager site database.

Each of the status summaries contains some state data. Only the component status and advertisement status summaries contain count data. The status summarizer views contain data such as the number of information, warning, and error messages for a site within a specified interval and the state of all components in a site at a specified interval.
