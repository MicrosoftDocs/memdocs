# Discovery views in Configuration Manager

The Configuration Manager discovery views consist of system resource objects, which include any resources that were discovered on the network. The four main discovery views are **v_R_System** for system resources, **v_R_User** for user resources, **v_R_UserGroup** for user group resources, and **v_R_UnknownSystem** for unknown systems.

Each of these discovered resources has a defined resource type, which is stored in the **v_resourcemap** schema view.

## Discovery schema views

The discovery schema views provide information about all resources in a Configuration Manager site. The two discovery schema views are **v_ResourceMap** and **v_ResourceAttributeMap**. The **v_ResourceMap** view contains a list of all the resource types for discovered data. By default, Configuration Manager has the Unknown System, User Group, User, and System Resource types, each of which has its own resource type number and individual view. The view can be joined to other views by using the **ResourceType** column. The following table contains the default data stored in the **v_ResourceMap** view.

### v_R_System_Valid
Lists information about valid computers. This view is sorted by **ResourceID** and includes the client version, the processor type, the client's domain, the NetBIOS name, the operating system and more.
This view can be joined to other views by using the **ResourceID** column.

|Resource type|Display name|Resource Class Name|
|--- |--- |--- |
|2|Unknown System|**v_R_UnknownSystem**|
|3|User Group|**v_R_UserGroup**|
|4|User|**v_R_User**|
|5|System|**v_R_System**|
|6|IP Network|**V_R_IPNetwork**|


The **v_ResourceAttributeMap** contains all of the attributes that will be discovered for each of the resource types, such as NetBIOS name, operating system, user name, user group name, domain name, and so forth. The **v_ResourceAttributeMap** view can be joined to other views by using the **ResourceType** column. The discovery schema views are also listed and described in the [Schema views in Configuration Manager](schema-views-configuration-manager.md) topic.

## Configuration Manager discovery views

The **v_R_System** view can be joined with any other view that contains system data (system discovery array views, inventory views, collection views, status views, and so forth) by using the **ResourceID** column. The **v_R_System** view will be one of the most often used when joining views. The **v_R_UnknownSystem**, **v_R_User**, and **v_R_UserGroup** views also use the **ResourceID** column to join with views that contain data for their resource type. Most of the remaining discovery views contain data where there can be more than one value for a resource, such as IP address or user organizational unit (OU) name. The discovery views are described in the following table.

### v_AgentDiscoveries

Lists all resources that have been discovered in the Configuration Manager hierarchy and by what discovery agent. The view contains data about the resource type, resource ID, agent that discovered the resource, site code where the agent resides, and time of the discovery.
The view can be joined to other views by using the **ResourceID** column.

### v_ClientMachines

Lists all discovered system resources, by resource ID, that are not in an obsolete or decommissioned state and whether the system resource is a Configuration Manager client.
The view can be joined to other views by using the **ResourceID** column.

### v_ClientMode

Lists all discovered system resources, by resource ID, that are not in an obsolete or decommissioned state and the associated client mode.
The view can be joined to other views by using the **ResourceID** column.

### v_R_System

Lists all discovered system resources by resource ID, resource type, whether the resource is a client, what type of client, client version, NetBIOS name, user name, operating system, unique identifier, and more.
The view can be joined to other views by using the **ResourceID**, **ResourceType**, **Netbios_Name0**, and **SMS_Unique_Identifier0** columns.

### v_RA_System_SMS_Resident

Lists the resident site of discovered devices.
The view can be joined to other views by using the **ResourceID** column.

### v_R_System_Valid

Lists all discovered system resources that are not in an obsolete or decommissioned state. This view is a subset of the **v_R_System** view and includes the resource ID, resource type, whether the resource is a client, what type of client, client version, NetBIOS name, user name, operating system, unique identifier, and so forth.
The view can be joined to other views by using the **ResourceID**, **ResourceType**, and **Netbios_Name0** columns.

### v_R_UnknownSystem

Lists all unknown system resources that have been discovered, including resource ID, resource type, user name, domain, and so forth.
The view can be joined to other views by using the **ResourceID**, **ResourceType**, and **SMS_Unique_Identifier0** columns.

### v_R_User

Lists all discovered user resources by resource ID, resource type, user name, domain, and so forth.
The view can be joined to other views by using the **ResourceID**, **ResourceType**, and **Unique_User_Name0** columns.

### v_R_UserGroup

Lists all discovered user group resources by ID, type, user group name, domain, and more.
The view can be joined to other views by using the **ResourceID** and **ResourceType** columns.

### v_RA_System_IPAddresses
