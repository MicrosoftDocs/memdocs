# Securing Configuration Manager Applications
The security model for Configuration Manager has changed significantly from previous versions of Configuration Manager. The previous security model has been replaced by Role-Based Administration.  

 For an extensive discussion of the Configuration Manager security and privacy model, see [Security and privacy for Configuration Manager](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/mt622694.aspx).  

 Specific to the Configuration Manager SDK, see [Configuration Manager Role-Based Administration](../../../develop/core/servers/configure/role-based-administration.md).
