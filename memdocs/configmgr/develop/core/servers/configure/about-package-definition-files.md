# About Package Definition Files
Package definition files are predefined scripts that you can use to help automate package creation with Configuration Manager. These are files that contain the package and program information that is needed to distribute a package to clients, with the exception of the source file location.  

 Package definition files often come with an application's source files or are available from the application's developer. Configuration Manager also has a selection of package definition files that are automatically imported and available in the Create Package from Definition Wizard. .  

 For more information about the format of these files, see the Package Definition File Format section later in this topic.  

## Package Definition File Format

 For example:  

 `EstimatedRunTime=25`  

 SupportedClients  
 Specifies the processors and operating systems on which this program runs. Each platform must be separated by a comma. If this entry is not included with the package definition file, supported platform checking is disabled for this program.  

 SupportedClientMinVersionX, SupportedClientMaxVersionX

 DriveLetterConnection  
 Specifies whether the program requires a drive letter connection to the package files on the distribution point. You can specify `True` or `False`.

When this value is set to `True`, the next available drive letter is used (starting with Z and proceeding backward).  

 SpecifyDrive

 DependentProgram=  

 Assignment  
 How the program is assigned to users. This value can be **FirstUser** (only the first user who logs on runs the program) or **EveryUser** (every user who logs on to the client runs the program). When **CanRunWhen** is not set to **UserLoggedOn**, this entry is set to **FirstUser**.  

 Disabled  
 Specifies whether this program can be advertised to clients. Available values are `True` or `False`. The default value is `False`.
