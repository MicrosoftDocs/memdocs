# How to Create a New Security Role
The administrative assignments for a user or security group are defined by the roles and security scopes assigned to that user or security group. The Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI)`SMS_Admin` class contains all the administrators defined in Configuration Manager. The security roles for an admin are in the `SMS_Admin.Roles` property and the security scopes for an admin are in the `SMS_Admin.Categories` property. Both of these properties expose an array of strings which correspond to the identifier of the role or security scope. Both properties are also marked as `lazy` and are read-only.  

> [!IMPORTANT]
>  `Lazy` properties are never retrieved with the class instance if the class instance was loaded from a query. The object must be directly accessed from WMI. Generally the WMI provider will supply a `Get` method that will accept a query path to the object.  

### To create a new Security Role  

1.  Set up a connection to the SMS Provider.  

2.  Create an instance of the `SMS_Role` WMI class.  

3.  Set the required properties, including a new role name and the original security role to copy.  

4.  Get an instance of the original `SMS_Role` WMI class.  

5.  Copy the role permissions from the original security role to the new security role. This is similar to the Admin Console functionality when creating a new security role and not strictly required to create the security role.  

6.  Save the new security role.  

## Example  
 The following example creates a new security role:  

```c#  
public void CreateRole(WqlConnectionManager connection, string roleName, string originalRoleID)  
{  
    // Create a new security role instance.  
    IResultObject newRole = connection.CreateInstance("SMS_Role");  

    // Set the required properties.  
    // Note: RoleDescription is not required, but convenient.  
    newRole.Properties["RoleName"].StringValue = roleName;  
    newRole.Properties["CopiedFromID"].StringValue = originalRoleID;  
    newRole.Properties["RoleDescription"].StringValue = roleName + " Description";  

    // Get the original role instance.  
    IResultObject originalRole = connection.GetInstance(@"SMS_Role.RoleID='" + originalRoleID + "'");  

    // Copy the original role permissions to the new security role.  
    newRole.SetArrayItems("Operations", originalRole.GetArrayItems("Operations"));  

    // Save the new security role.  
    newRole.Put();  
}  

```  

 The example method has the following parameters:  

||||  
|-|-|-|  
|Parameter|Type|Description|  
|`connection`|-   Managed: `WqlConnectionManager`|A valid connection to the SMS Provider.|  
|roleName|-   Managed: `String`|A name for the new role.|  
|`originalRoleID`|-   Managed: `String`|The identifier of the original security role.|  

## Compiling the Code  
 The C# example requires:  

### Namespaces  
 Microsoft.ConfigurationManagement.ManagementProvider  

 Microsoft.ConfigurationManagement.ManagementProvider.WqlQueryEngine  

 System  

### Assembly
