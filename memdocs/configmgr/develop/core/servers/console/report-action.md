# Configuration Manager Report Action
The report action displays a Configuration Manager report in the Configuration Manager console.  

 The following attributes and elements are specific to an action that opens a report box:  

-   The `ActionDescription` element `Class` attribute is set to **Report**.  

-   The `ReportDescription` element `ReportName` attribute is the GUID of the report to be displayed. The GUID maps to the `SMS_Report` class `ReportGUID` property.  

> [!NOTE]
>  An alternative method to load a report is to use the executable action to launch the report's URL. This will display the report in a new window rather than in the Configuration Manager console.  

## Sample Report Action XML  
 The following XML demonstrates how to display a report, identified by its GUID, in the Configuration Manager console:  

```  
<ActionDescription Class="Report" DisplayName="Test Action (report)" MnemonicDisplayName="Mnemonic" Description="Description"> <ShowOn>      <string>DefaultContextualTab</string> <!-- RIBBON -->     <string>ContextMenu</string> <!-- Context Menu -->   </ShowOn>        
 <ReportDescription ReportName="05874720-1D08-4CF7-B182-5F9D065BEAE5">  
 </ReportDescription>  
</ActionDescription>  
```
