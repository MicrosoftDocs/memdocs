# Configuration Manager AssemblyType Action
The `AssemblyType` action defines the type and assembly for a method that is called by the Configuration Manager console.  

> [!NOTE]
>  The XML and C# code in this topic is available in the Dialog Prototype sample in the Configuration Manager SDK.  

 The following attributes and elements are specific to an action that calls a method in an assembly:  

-   The `Class` attribute of the `ActionDescription` element is set to `AssemblyType`.  

-   The `ActionAssembly` element has a number of child elements that are used to define the method and assembly.  

-   The `Assembly` element identifies the assembly that contains the method. If the assembly is in a folder other than %*ProgramFiles*%\Microsoft Configuration Manager\AdminConsole\bin folder then the `Assembly` element should include the assembly filename and the full path to the file.  

-   The `Type` element contains the namespace and class for the method.  

-   The `Method` element contains the name of the method to be called.  

## Method  
 The method signature is:  

```  
public static void Method(object, ScopeNode, ActionDescription, IResultObject, PropertyDataUpdated, Status)  
```  

 Where the parameters are as follows:  

 `object`  
 The object calling the method.  

 `ScopeNode`  
 The Configuration Manager console node that was active when the action was called.  

 `ActionDescription`  
 The `ActionDescription` class instance that initiated the action.  

 `IResultObject`  
 The selected object, or `null` if there is no selected object.  

 `PropertyDataUpdated`  
 The delegate to open to provide update information for the Configuration Manager console view.  

 `Status`  
 Allows control of the Configuration Manager console busy status indicator.  

### Example Implementation  
 The following is an example implementation of the method.  

```  
public static void Method(object sender, ScopeNode scopeNode, ActionDescription action, IResultObject resultObject, PropertyDataUpdated dataUpdatedDelegate, Status status)   
{  
    if (resultObject != null)   
    {  
        MessageBox.Show(string.Format("The {0} package was selected", resultObject["Name"].StringValue));   
    }  
    else  
    {  
        MessageBox.Show("No package was selected");  
    }  
}  

```  

## AssemblyType Action XML  
 The following XML example demonstrates how to call a method, `Method`, in a class, `SampleClass`. The method is in the assembly `AdminUI.PrototypeDialog.dll`.  

```  
<ActionDescription Class="AssemblyType" DisplayName="Test Action (method)" MnemonicDisplayName="Mnemonic" Description="Description">  
  <ShowOn>  
    <string>DefaultHomeTab</string>  
    <string>ContextMenu</string>  
  </ShowOn>  
  <ActionAssembly>  
    <Assembly>AdminUI.PrototypeDialog.dll</Assembly>  
    <Type>Microsoft.ConfigurationManagement.AdminConsole.PrototypeDialog.ExampleClass</Type>  
    <Method>Method</Method>  
    <!--Method signature: public static void Method(object sender, ScopeNode scopeNode, ActionDescription action, IResultObject resultObject, PropertyDataUpdated dataUpdatedDelegate, Status status)-->   
  </ActionAssembly>  
</ActionDescription>  

```
