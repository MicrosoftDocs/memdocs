# SMS_DeviceEnrollmentProfile Server WMI Class
The `SMS_DeviceEnrollmentProfile` Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) class is an SMS Provider server class, in Configuration Manager, that represents a device enrollment profile in the database.  

 The following syntax is simplified from Managed Object Format (MOF) code and includes all inherited properties.  

## Syntax  

```  
Class SMS_DeviceEnrollmentProfile : SMS_BaseClass  
{  
    String CertAuthorities[];  
    String CertCIUniqueID;  
    String Description;  
    String DevicesContainerDN;  
    String DevicesGroup;  
    String EnrollmentSiteCode;  
    String ManagementSiteCode;  
    String Name;  
    UInt32 ProfileID;  
    UInt32 ProfileType;  
    UInt32 RecordExpiryMinutes;  
};  
```
