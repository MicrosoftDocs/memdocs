# SMS_MDMCorpOwnedDevices Server WMI Class
The `SMS_MDMCorpOwnedDevices` Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) class is an SMS Provider server class, in Configuration Manager, that represents On-premises Mobile Device Management  (MDM)  corporate owned devices.  

 The following syntax is simplified from Managed Object Format (MOF) code and includes all inherited properties.  

## Syntax  

```  
Class SMS_MDMCorpOwnedDevices : SMS_BaseClass  
{  
    DateTime ActualEnrollmentProfileAssignedTime;  
    String ActualEnrollmentProfileId;  
    String AssetTag;  
    String Color;  
    String Description;  
    String DeviceAssignedBy;  
    DateTime DeviceAssignedDate;  
    String DeviceId;  
    String DeviceName;  
    UInt32 DeviceType;  
    UInt32 DiscoverySources;  
    String EnrollmentPackageId;  
    UInt32 EnrollmentStatus;  
    UInt32 EnrollmentType;  
    String ExchangeDeviceId;  
    String IMEI;  
    DateTime LastUpdateTime;  
    String Model;  
    String OSVersion;  
    DateTime ProfileAssignedTime;  
    String ProfileName;  
    DateTime ProfilePushedTime;  
    UInt32 ProfileStatus;  
    String ProfileUuid;  
    DateTime RequestEnrollmentProfileAssignedTime;  
    String RequestEnrollmentProfileId;  
    String SerialNumber;  
    String UniqueId;  
};  

```
