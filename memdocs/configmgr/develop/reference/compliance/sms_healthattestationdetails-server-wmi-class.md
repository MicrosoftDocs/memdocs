# SMS_HealthAttestationDetails Server WMI Class
The `SMS_HealthAttestationDetails` Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) class is an SMS Provider server class, in Configuration Manager, that represents Health Attestation details.  

 The following syntax is simplified from Managed Object Format (MOF) code and includes all inherited properties.  

## Syntax  

```  
Class SMS_HealthAttestationDetails : SMS_BaseClass  
{  
     UInt32 AIKPresent;  
     SInt32 BitlockerStatus;  
     UInt32 BootDebuggingEnabled;  
     UIt32 CertRetrievalStatus;  
     UInt32 CodeIntegrityEnabled;  
     DateTime DateIssued;  
     UInt64 DEPPolicy;  
     UInt32 DeviceItemKey;  
     UInt32 ELAMDriverLoaded;  
     UInt32 HASSupported;  
     UInt32 OSKernelDebuggingEnabled;  
     UInt32 SafeMode;  
     UInt32 SecureBootEnabled;  
     UInt32 TestSigningEnabled;  
     UInt32 VSMEnabled;  
     UInt32 WinPE;  
};  

```
