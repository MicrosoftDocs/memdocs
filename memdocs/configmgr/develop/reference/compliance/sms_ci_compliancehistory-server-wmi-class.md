{  
      UInt32 CI_ID;  
      String CI_UniqueID;  
      UInt32 CIVersion;   
      DateTime ComplianceEndDate;  
      DateTime ComplianceStartDate;  
      UInt32 ComplianceValidationRuleFailures;  
      UInt32 DesiredState;  
      Boolean IsApplicable;  
      Boolean IsCompliant;  
      Boolean IsDetected;  
      UInt32 MaxNoncomplianceCriticality;   
      String ModelName;  
      UInt32 ResourceID;  
      UInt32 SDMPackageVersion;   
      String UserName;  
};  
```
