# SetEnforcement Method in Class SMS_ConfigurationItem
The `SetEnforcement` Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) class method, in Configuration Manager, sets the enforcement and the enforcement date for a configuration item.  

 The following syntax is simplified from Managed Object Format (MOF) code and defines the method.  

## Syntax  

```  
SInt32 SetEnforcement(  
     Boolean Enforced,  
     DateTime EffectiveDate  
);  
```  

#### Parameters  
 `Enforced`  
 Data type: `Boolean`  

 Qualifiers: [in]  

 `true` if policy enforcement is enabled.  

 `EffectiveDate`  
 Data type: `DateTime`  

 Qualifiers: [in]  

 The date and time, in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), when the configuration item is compliant.  

## Return Values  
 An `SInt32` data type that is 0 to indicate success or non-zero to indicate failure.
