# SMS_CIRelation_Flat Server WMI Class
The `SMS_CIRelation_Flat` Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) class is an SMS Provider server class, in Configuration Manager, that provides a flat list of relationship information for directly or indirectly related configuration items.  

 The following syntax is simplified from Managed Object Format (MOF) code and includes all inherited properties.  

## Syntax  

```  
Class SMS_CIRelation_Flat : SMS_BaseClass  
{  
    UInt32 FromCIID;  
    Boolean IsVersionSpecific;  
    UInt32 Level;  
    UInt32 RelationType;  
    UInt32 ToCIID;  
};  
```  

## Methods  
 The `SMS_CIRelation_Flat` class does not define any methods.  

## Properties  
 `FromCIID`  
 Data type: `UInt32`  

 Access type: Read/Write  

 Qualifiers: [key]
