# SMS_G_System_CI_ComplianceState Server WMI Class
The `SMS_G_System_CI_ComplianceState` Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) class is an SMS Provider server class, in Configuration Manager, that represents hardware inventory class objects for the compliance state of a configuration item.  

 The following syntax is simplified from Managed Object Format (MOF) code and includes all inherited properties.  

## Syntax  

```  
Class SMS_G_System_CI_ComplianceState : SMS_G_System  
{  
      UInt32 CI_ID;  
      String CI_UniqueID;   
      UInt32 CIVersion;  
      UInt32 ComplianceState;  
      String ComplianceStateName;  
      UInt32 DesiredState;  
      UInt32 IsApplicable;  
      UInt32 IsDetected;  
      UInt32 LastComplianceErrorID;  
      String LocalizedDisplayName;   
      UInt32 MaxNoncomplianceCriticality;  
      UInt32 ResourceID;  
      UInt32 SDMPackageVersion;   
      UInt32 UserID;  
      String UserName;  
};  
```

## Remarks  
 Class qualifiers for this class include:  

- Read (read-only)  

  For more information about both the class qualifiers and the property qualifiers included in the Properties section, see [Configuration Manager Class and Property Qualifiers](../../../develop/reference/misc/class-and-property-qualifiers.md).  

  Your application uses this class to update and determine the compliance state of the configuration item in the server database.
