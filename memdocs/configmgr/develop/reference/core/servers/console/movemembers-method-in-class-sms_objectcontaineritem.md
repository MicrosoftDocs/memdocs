# MoveMembers Method in Class SMS_ObjectContainerItem
The `MoveMembers` Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) class method, in Configuration Manager, moves folder items to another folder.  

 The following syntax is simplified from Managed Object Format (MOF) code and defines the method.  

## Syntax  

```  
SInt32 MoveMembers(  
     String InstanceKeys[],  
     UInt32 ContainerNodeID,   
     UInt32 TargetContainerNodeID,   
     UInt32 ObjectType,  
);  
```  

#### Parameters  
 `InstanceKeys`  
 Data type: `String` Array  

 Qualifiers: [in]  

 Instance keys that identify the folder items to move.  

 `ContainerNodeID`  
 Data type: `UInt32`  

 Qualifiers: [in]  

 ID of the folder, or node, from which to copy the items.  

 `TargetContainerNodeID`  
 Data type: `UInt32`  

 Qualifiers: [in]  

 ID of the folder, or node, to which to move the items.  

 `ObjectType`  
 Data type: `UInt32`  

 Qualifiers: [in]  

 The type of object supported by the console folder.  

## Return Value  
 An `SInt32` data type that is 0 to indicate success or non-zero to indicate failure.  

 For information about handling returned errors, see [About Configuration Manager Errors](../../../../../develop/core/understand/about-configuration-manager-errors.md).  

## Remarks  
 An item cannot be moved to a folder of a different type. The `ObjectType` properties of [SMS_ObjectContainerNode Server WMI Class](../../../../../develop/reference/core/servers/console/sms_objectcontainernode-server-wmi-class.md) and [SMS_ObjectContainerItem Server WMI Class](../../../../../develop/reference/core/servers/console/sms_objectcontaineritem-server-wmi-class.md) can be used to determine object types.
