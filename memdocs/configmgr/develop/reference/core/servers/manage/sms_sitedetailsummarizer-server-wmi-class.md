# SMS_SiteDetailSummarizer Server WMI Class
The `SMS_SiteDetailSummarizer` Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) class is an SMS Provider server class, in Configuration Manager, that provides per-site status of components and the system. An instance of this class is created for each site.  

 The following syntax is simplified from Managed Object Format (MOF) code and includes all inherited properties.  

## Syntax  

```  
Class SMS_SiteDetailSummarizer : SMS_BaseClass  
{  
      UInt32 AvailabilityState;

      UInt32 Errors;  
      UInt32 Infos;  
      String SiteCode;  
      String SiteName;  
      UInt32 Status;  
      String TallyInterval;  
      UInt32 TransFree;  
      String Version;  
      UInt32 Warnings;  
};  
```
