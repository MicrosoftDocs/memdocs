# ICCMEvent::SubmitPending Method
In Configuration Manager, the `ICcmEvent::SubmitPending` method submits an event that is stored by Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI).  

## Syntax  

```  
[C++]  
HRESULT ICcmEvent::SubmitPending(  
      BSTR bstrEventID,   
      long lFlags  
);  
```  

#### Parameters  
 `bstrEventID`  
 Data type: `BSTR`  

 Qualifiers: [in, optional, defaultvalue("0")]  

 Reserved. Must be `null`.  

 `lFlags`  
 Data type: `long`  

 Qualifiers: [in, optional, defaultvalue(0)]  

 Reserved. Must be zero.  

## Return Values  
 An `HRESULT` code. Possible values include, but are not limited to, the following:  

 S_OK  
 The method succeeded.  

## Remarks  
 Your application should use this method instead of the [Submit method](../../../../../develop/reference/core/servers/manage/iccmevent--submit-method.md) in situations where the Configuration Manager Agent Host (CCMEXEC) service might not be running. Instead of directly calling CCMEXEC to submit the event, this method stores it in WMI. If the service is running, the event is picked up immediately and issued. Otherwise, it is issued the next time the service starts.  

## Requirements  
 Smscore.dll.
