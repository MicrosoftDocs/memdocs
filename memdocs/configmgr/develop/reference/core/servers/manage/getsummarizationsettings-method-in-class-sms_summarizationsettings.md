# GetSummarizationSettings Method in Class SMS_SummarizationSettings
The `GetSummarizationSettings` Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) class method, in Configuration Manager, gets the summarization schedule.  

 The following syntax is simplified from Managed Object Format (MOF) code and defines the method.  

## Syntax  

```  
sint32 GetSummarizationSettings(  
     string SiteCode,   
     uint32 SummarizationType,   
     uint32 FirstIntervalMins,   
     uint32 SecondIntervalMins,   
     uint32 ThirdIntervalMins  
);  
```  

#### Parameters  
 `SiteCode`  
 Data type: `String`  

 Qualifiers: [in]  

 The site code of the site associated with the summarization settings.  

 `SummarizationType`  
 Data type: `UInt32`  

 Qualifiers: [in]  

 Types of summarization. Possible values are:  

|||  
|-|-|  
|2|Application Deployment Summarization|  
|3|Application State Summarization (spans all previous and current deployments)|  

 `FirstIntervalMins`  
 Data type: `UInt32`  

 Qualifiers: [out]  

 The interval in minutes between summarizations for deployments that have a start date within 30 days (for deployment summarizations) or applications that have been created in the last 30 days (for application state summarization).  

 `SecondIntervalMins`  
 Data type: `UInt32`  

 Qualifiers: [out]  

 The interval in minutes between summarizations for deployments that have a start date within the last 30-90 days (for deployment summarizations) or applications that have been created within the last 30-90 days (for application state summarization).  

 `ThirdIntervalMins`  
 Data type: `UInt32`  

 Qualifiers: [out]  

 The interval in minutes between summarizations for deployments that have a start date over 90 days (for deployment summarizations) or applications that have been created over 90 days ago (for application state summarization).  

## Return Values  
 An  `SInt32` data type that is 0 to indicate success or non-zero to indicate failure.
