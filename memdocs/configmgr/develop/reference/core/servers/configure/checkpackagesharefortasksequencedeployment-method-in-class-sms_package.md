# CheckPackageShareForTaskSequenceDeployment Method in Class SMS_Package
The `CheckPackageShareForTaskSequenceDeployment` Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) class method, in Configuration Manager, that checks whether the package share type meets the requirements of a task sequence deployment.  

 The following syntax is simplified from Managed Object Format (MOF) code and defines the method.  

## Syntax  

```  
uint32 CheckPackageShareForTaskSequenceDeployment   
{  
    [IN]    String PackageID  
    [OUT]   Boolean IsValid  
    [OUT]   String InvalidTaskSequenceDeploymentIDs[]  
    [OUT]   String InvalidTaskSequenceDeploymentNames[]  
};  
```  

## Parameters  
 `PackageID`  
 Data type: `String`  

 Qualifiers: [id("0"), in]  

 Package identifier.  

 `IsValid`  
 Data type: `Boolean`  

 Qualifiers: [id("1"), out]  

 `true` if the package is valid for task sequence use. `false` if the package is invalid for task sequence use. If the package is referred to by a run-from-net deployment, the package must be available as a share on a distribution point.  

 `InvalidTaskSequenceDeploymentIDs`  
 Data type: `String` Array  

 Qualifiers: [id("2"), out]  

 Identifiers of task sequence deployments that are invalid because this package is not valid for task sequence use.  

 `InvalidTaskSequenceDeploymentNames`  
 Data type: `String Array`  

 Qualifiers: [id("3"), out]  

 Names of task sequence deployments that are invalid because this package is not valid for task sequence use.
