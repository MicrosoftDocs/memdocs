# SMS_Client_Reg_MultiString_List Server WMI Class
The `SMS_Client_Reg_MultiString_List` Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) class is an SMS Provider server class, in Configuration Manager, that represents a list of client registry multi-string items from the site control file.  

 The following syntax is simplified from Managed Object Format (MOF) code and includes all inherited properties.  

## Syntax  

```  
Class SMS_Client_Reg_MultiString_List  
{  
     String ItemType;  
     String ValueName;  
     String KeyPath;  
     String ValueStrings[];  
};  
```  

## Methods  
 The `SMS_Client_Reg_MultiString_List` class does not define any methods.  

## Properties  
 `ItemType`  
 Data type: `String`  

 Access type: Read-only
