# SMS_ST_RecurMonthlyByWeekday Server WMI Class
The `SMS_ST_RecurMonthlyByWeekday` WMI class is an SMS Provider server class, in Configuration Manager, that represents a schedule token for events that occur for a specific day of the week, on a given week of the month, at a given monthly interval, for example, the second Saturday of every month.  

 The following syntax is simplified from Managed Object Format (MOF) code and includes all inherited properties.

{  
      UInt32 Day;  
      UInt32 DayDuration;  
      UInt32 ForNumberOfMonths;  
      UInt32 HourDuration;  
      Boolean IsGMT;  
      UInt32 MinuteDuration;  
      DateTime StartTime;  
      UInt32 WeekOrder;  
};  
```
