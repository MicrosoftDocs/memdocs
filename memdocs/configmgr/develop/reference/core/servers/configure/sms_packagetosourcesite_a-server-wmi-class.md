# SMS_PackageToSourceSite_a Server WMI Class
The `SMS_PackageToSourceSite_a` Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) class is an SMS Provider server class, in Configuration Manager, that uses the `SiteCode` property to relate an [SMS_Package Server WMI Class](../../../../../develop/reference/core/servers/configure/sms_package-server-wmi-class.md) object to the [SMS_Site Server WMI Class](../../../../../develop/reference/core/servers/configure/sms_site-server-wmi-class.md) object for the site that created the package.
