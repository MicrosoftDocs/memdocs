# SMS_ST_RecurMonthlyByDate Server WMI Class
The `SMS_ST_RecurMonthlyByDate` Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) class is an SMS Provider server class, in Configuration Manager, that represents a schedule token for events that occur on designated days at designated monthly intervals, for example, every third month on the 15th day of the month.  

 The following syntax is simplified from Managed Object Format (MOF) code and includes all inherited properties.  

## Syntax  

```  
Class SMS_ST_RecurMonthlyByDate : SMS_ScheduleToken  
{  
      UInt32 DayDuration;  
      UInt32 ForNumberOfMonths;  
      UInt32 HourDuration;  
      Boolean IsGMT;  
      UInt32 MinuteDuration;  
      UInt32 MonthDay;  
      DateTime StartTime;  
};  
```
