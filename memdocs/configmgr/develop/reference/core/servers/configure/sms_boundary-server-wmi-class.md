# SMS_Boundary Server WMI Class
The `SMS_Boundary` Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) class is an SMS Provider server class, in Configuration Manager, that represents a boundary defined within the hierarchy.  

 The following syntax is simplified from Managed Object Format (MOF) code and includes all inherited properties.  

## Syntax  

```  
Class SMS_Boundary : SMS_BaseClass  
{  
    UInt32 BoundaryFlags;  
    UInt32 BoundaryID;  
    UInt32 BoundaryType;  
    String CreatedBy;  
    DateTime CreatedOn;  
    String DefaultSiteCode[];  
    String DisplayName;  
    UInt32 GroupCount;  
    String ModifiedBy;  
    DateTime ModifiedOn;  
    String SiteSystems[];  
    String Value;  
};  
```  

## Methods  
 The `SMS_Boundary` class does not define any methods.  

## Properties
