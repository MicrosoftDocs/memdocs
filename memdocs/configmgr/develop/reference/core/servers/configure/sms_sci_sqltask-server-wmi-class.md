# SMS_SCI_SQLTask Server WMI Class
The `SMS_SCI_SQLTask` Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) class is an SMS Provider server class, in Configuration Manager, that defines a SQL task to be run periodically.  

 The following syntax is simplified from Managed Object Format (MOF) code and includes all inherited properties.  

## Syntax  

```  
Class SMS_SCI_SQLTask : SMS_SiteControlItem   
{  
     DateTime BeginTime;  
     UInt32 DaysOfWeek;  
     UInt32 DeleteOlderThan;  
     String DeviceName;  
     Boolean Enabled;  
     UInt32 FileType;  
     String ItemName;  
     String ItemType;  
     DateTime LatestBeginTime;  
     UInt32 NumRefreshDays;  
     String SiteCode;  
     String TaskName;  
     UInt32 TaskType;  
};  
```
