# SMS_PackageStatusRootSummarizer Server WMI Class
The `SMS_PackageStatusRootSummarizer` Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) class is an SMS Provider server class, in Configuration Manager, that lists the distribution summary for a given package for all sites in a hierarchy.  

 The following syntax is simplified from Managed Object Format (MOF) code and includes all inherited properties.  

## Syntax  

```  
Class SMS_PackageStatusRootSummarizer : SMS_BaseClass  
{  
      UInt32 Failed;  
      UInt32 Installed;  
      String Name;  
      String PackageID;  
      UInt32 Retrying;  
      UInt32 SourceCompressedSize;  
      DateTime SourceDate;  
      String SourceSite;  
      UInt32 SourceSize;  
      UInt32 SourceVersion;  
      UInt32 Targeted;  
};  
```

 The `SMS_PackageStatusRootSummarizer` class does not define any methods.
