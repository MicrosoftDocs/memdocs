# SMS_AzureService server WMI class

The `SMS_AzureService` WMI class is an SMS Provider server class in Configuration Manager, that represents a Microsoft Azure service which is a cloud distribution point for Configuration Manager.  

The following syntax is simplified from Managed Object Format (MOF) code and includes all inherited properties.  

## Syntax  

```  
Class SMS_AzureService : SMS_BaseClass  
{  
    UInt32 AzureServiceID;  
    String DeploymentSlot;

    UInt32 Flags;  
    String Fqdn;  
    String ManagementCertificate;  
    UInt32 ManagementCertificateType;  
    String ManagementThumbprint;  
    String NALPath;  
    String Name;  
    UInt32 NumberOfInstances;  
    String Region;  
    String ServiceCertificate;  
    String ServiceCName;  
    String ServiceThumbprint;
