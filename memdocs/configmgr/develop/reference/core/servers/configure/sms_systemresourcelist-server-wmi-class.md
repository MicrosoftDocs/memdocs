# SMS_SystemResourceList Server WMI Class
The `SMS_SystemResourceList` Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) class is an SMS Provider server class, in Configuration Manager, that maps network abstraction layer (NAL) paths, resource types, site codes, and role names for system resources located on site servers.  

 The following syntax is simplified from Managed Object Format (MOF) code and includes all inherited properties.  

## Syntax  

```  
Class SMS_SystemResourceList : SMS_BaseClass   
{  
     Boolean InternetEnabled;  
     Boolean InternetShared;  
     String NALPath;  
     String ResourceType;  
     String RoleName;  
     String ServerName,  
     String ServerRemoteName,  
     String SiteCode,  
     UInt32 SslState  
};  
```
