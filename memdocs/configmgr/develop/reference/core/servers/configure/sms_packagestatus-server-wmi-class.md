# SMS_PackageStatus Server WMI Class
The `SMS_PackageStatus` Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) class is an SMS Provider server class, in Configuration Manager, that provides a summary report of the health of packages and distribution points in the site.  

 The following syntax is simplified from Managed Object Format (MOF) code and includes all inherited properties.  

## Syntax  

```  
Class SMS_PackageStatus : SMS_BaseClass  
{  
      String Location;  
      String PackageID;  
      SInt32 Personality;  
      String PkgServer;  
      String ShareName;  
      String SiteCode;  
      SInt32 Status;  
      SInt32 Type;  
      DateTime UpdateTime;  
};  
```

## Remarks  
 Class qualifiers for this class include:  

- Read (read-only)  

  For more information about both the class qualifiers and the property qualifiers included in the Properties section, see [Configuration Manager Class and Property Qualifiers](../../../../../develop/reference/misc/class-and-property-qualifiers.md).  

  This class is used internally by the server Distribution Manager component and is not used directly to produce any of the package status information that you see in the Configuration Manager console.  

  You can distribute multiple packages concurrently to multiple destinations. `SMS_PackageStatus` allows monitoring when packages arrive at distribution points. All the displayed dates are based on the time zone in which the Configuration Manager console is running.
