# DDRNew
The `DDRNew` function, in Configuration Manager, begins a new data discovery record (DDR).  

## Syntax  

```  
[IDL]  
HRESULT DDRNew();  
```  

#### Parameters  
 `Architecture`  
 Name of the architecture. The name can refer to an existing or new architecture. The name is used to determine the resource class name. For example, specifying `Car` identifies the `SMS_R_Car` resource class.  

 `AgentName`  
 Discovery agent that reports the DDR. This name, which should be unique, is added to the `AgentName` property array.  

 `SiteCode`  
 Site where the resource was discovered. This site name is added to the `AgentSite` property array.  

## Return Values  
 The `DDRNew` function always returns S_OK.  

## Remarks  
 You must call this function first for each DDR that you create; calling this function begins your DDR.  

 The `sArchitecture` string is used to identify your resource class name and can take one of the following forms:  

- A single word such as Car, which you can use to identify the `SMS_R_Car`resource class.  

- A multiword string such as Carpool Inventory, which you can use to identify the `SMS_R_CarpoolInventory` resource class.  

- A DMTF-formatted string such as ACME&#124;Car&#124;1.0, which you can use to identify the `SMS_R_ACME_Car_1_0` resource class.  

- The string "System" identifies a computer system.  

  The agent name, `sAgentName`*,* should always be filled in and should identify the program used to generate the DDR.
