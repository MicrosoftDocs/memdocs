# SMS_DistributionPointGroup Server WMI Class
The `SMS_DistributionPointGroup` Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) class is an SMS Provider server class, in Configuration Manager, that represents a group of distribution points rendered in the Configuration Manager console.  

 The following syntax is simplified from Managed Object Format (MOF) code and includes all inherited properties.  

## Syntax  

```  
Class SMS_DistributionPointGroup : SMS_BaseClass  
{  
    UInt32 CollectionCount;  
    UInt32 ContentCount;  
    Boolean ContentInSync;  
    String CreatedBy;  
    DateTime CreatedOn;  
    String Description;  
    String GroupID;  
    Boolean HasMember;  
    Boolean HasRelationship;  
    UInt32 MemberCount;  
    String ModifiedBy;  
    DateTime ModifiedOn;  
    String Name;  
    UInt32 OutOfSyncContentCount;  
    String SourceSite;  
};  
```
