# SMS_PkgToPkgAccess_a Server WMI Class
The `SMS_PkgToPkgAccess_a` Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) class is an SMS Provider server class, in Configuration Manager, that uses the `PackageID` property to relate an [SMS_Package Server WMI Class](../../../../../develop/reference/core/servers/configure/sms_package-server-wmi-class.md) object with the [SMS_PackageAccessByUsers Server WMI Class](../../../../../develop/reference/core/servers/configure/sms_packageaccessbyusers-server-wmi-class.md) object used to access the package on its distribution points.
