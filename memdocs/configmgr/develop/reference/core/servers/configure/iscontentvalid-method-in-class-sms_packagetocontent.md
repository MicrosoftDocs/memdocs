# IsContentValid Method in Class SMS_PackageToContent
The `IsContentValid` Windows Management (WMI) class method, in Configuration Manager, determines if the package content is valid.  

 The following syntax is simplified from Managed Object Format (MOF) code and defines the method.  

## Syntax  

```  
Boolean IsContentValid();  
```  

#### Parameters  
 None.  

## Return Values  
 A `Boolean` data type that is `true` if the package contains all the files for the content; otherwise `false`.  

## Remarks  
 This method checks the package to ensure that all files are available for the content. It also checks to ensure that the licensing terms are met.
