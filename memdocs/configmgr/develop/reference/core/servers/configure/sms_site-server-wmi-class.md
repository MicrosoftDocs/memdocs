# SMS_Site Server WMI Class
The `SMS_Site` Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) class is an SMS Provider server class, in Configuration Manager, that represents identification and status data for a Configuration Manager site installation.  

 The following syntax is simplified from Managed Object Format (MOF) code and includes all inherited properties.  

## Syntax  

```  
Class SMS_Site : SMS_BaseClass   
{   
      UInt32 BuildNumber;   
      String Features;   
      String InstallDir;   
      UInt32 Mode;   
      String ReportingSiteCode;   
      UInt32 RequestedStatus;   
      UInt32 SecondarySiteCMUpdateStatus;  
      String ServerName;   
      String SiteCode;   
      String SiteName;   
      UInt32 Status;   
      String TimeZoneInfo;   
      UInt32 Type;   
      String Version;   
};  
```
