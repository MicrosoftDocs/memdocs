# SendNotifySuccessToCTM Method
The **SendNotifySuccessToCTM** method notifies Content Transfer Manager of the success of a job.  

> [!NOTE]
>  When calling this method, the number of bytes/files transferred (`szBytesTransferred`) should equal the total (`szBytesTotal`).  

## Syntax  

```  
HRESULT stdcall SendNotifySuccessToCTM(  
    LPCWSTR szEndpoint,   
    LPCWSTR szID,   
    LPCWSTR szClientData,   
    LPCWSTR szBytesTotal,   
    LPCWSTR szBytesTransferred,   
    ULONG ulFilesTotal,   
    ULONG ulFilesTransferred  
);  

```  

#### Parameters  
 `szEndpoint`  
 Data type: LPCWSTR  

 Qualifiers: [in]  

 The notification endpoint. This was passed into the call to **ICcmAlternateDownloadProvider::DownloadContent** (szNotifyEndpoint).  

 `szID`  
 Data type: UInt32  

 Qualifiers: [in]  

 The job to which the notification corresponds. This is the GUID originally returned by **ICcmAlternateDownloadProvider::DownloadContent**.  

 `szClientData`  
 Data type: LPCWSTR  

 Qualifiers: [in]  

 The client-specific data which was passed into the call to **ICcmAlternateDownloadProvider::DownloadContent** (szNotifyData).  

 `szBytesTotal`  
 Data type: LPCWSTR  

 Qualifiers: [in]  

 The total number of bytes in the job.  

 `szBytesTransferred`  
 Data type: LPCWSTR  

 Qualifiers: [in]  

 The number of bytes transferred so far.  

 `ulFilesTotal`  
 Data type: ULONG  

 Qualifiers: [in]  

 The total number of files in the job.  

 `ulFilesTransferred`  
 Data type: ULONG  

 Qualifiers: [in]  

 The number of files transferred so far.
