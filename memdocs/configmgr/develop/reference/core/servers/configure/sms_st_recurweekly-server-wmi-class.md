# SMS_ST_RecurWeekly Server WMI Class
The `SMS_ST_RecurWeekly` Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) class is an SMS Provider server class, in Configuration Manager, that represents a schedule token for events that occur at weekly intervals, for example, every third week on Wednesday.  

 The following syntax is simplified from Managed Object Format (MOF) code and includes all inherited properties.

{  
      UInt32 Day;  
      UInt32 DayDuration;  
      UInt32 ForNumberOfWeeks;  
      UInt32 HourDuration;  
      Boolean IsGMT;  
      UInt32 MinuteDuration;  
      DateTime StartTime;  
};  
```
