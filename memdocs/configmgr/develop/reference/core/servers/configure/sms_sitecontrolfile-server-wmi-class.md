# SMS_SiteControlFile Server WMI Class
The `SMS_SiteControlFile` Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) class is an SMS Provider server class, in Configuration Manager, that represents the site control file and contains methods to maintain version control of the site control file.  

 The following syntax is simplified from Managed Object Format (MOF) code and includes all inherited properties.  

## Syntax  

```  
Class SMS_SiteControlFile : SMS_BaseClass   
{  
     String BuildNumber;  
     UInt32 FileType;  
     String FormatVersion;  
     String SCFData;  
     UInt32 SerialNumber;  
     String SiteCode;  
};  
```  

## Methods  
 The `SMS_SiteControlFile` class does not define any methods.  

## Properties  
 `BuildNumber`  
 Data type: `String`  

 Access type: Read/Write

 Build number of the Configuration Manager installation that create the site control file. The default value is "".  

 `FileType`  
 Data type: `UInt32`  

 Access type: Read/Write  

 Qualifiers: [key, enumeration:ToSubClass]  

 This property is deprecated.

## Remarks  
 Class qualifiers for this class include:  

- Read (read-only)  

  For more information about both the class qualifiers and the property qualifiers included in the Properties section, see [Configuration Manager Class and Property Qualifiers](../../../../../develop/reference/misc/class-and-property-qualifiers.md).  

  Your application uses the methods of this class to perform version control of the site control file. To update the contents of the site control file, the application should use classes derived from [SMS_SiteControlItem Server WMI Class](../../../../../develop/reference/core/servers/configure/sms_sitecontrolitem-server-wmi-class.md).
