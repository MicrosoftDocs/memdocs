# SMS_BoundaryGroup Server WMI Class
The `SMS_BoundaryGroup` Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) class is an SMS Provider server class, in Configuration Manager, that represents a boundary group defined in the site hierarchy.  

 The following syntax is simplified from Managed Object Format (MOF) code and includes all inherited properties.  

## Syntax  

```  
Class SMS_BoundaryGroup : SMS_BaseClass  
{  
    String CreatedBy;  
    DateTime CreatedOn;  
    String DefaultSiteCode;  
    String Description;  
    UInt32 GroupID;  
    UInt32 MemberCount;  
    String ModifiedBy;  
    DateTime ModifiedOn;  
    String Name;  
    Boolean Shared;  
    UInt32 SiteSystemCount;  
};  
```

 The following table lists the methods in the `SMS_BoundaryGroup` class.
