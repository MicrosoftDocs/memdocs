# SMS_SII_Property Server WMI Class
The `SMS_SII_Property` Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) class is an SMS Provider server class, in Configuration Manager, that represents a general-purpose storage object for property data that can be represented as a single integer or two strings.  

 The following syntax is simplified from Managed Object Format (MOF) code and includes all inherited properties.  

## Syntax  

```  
Class SMS_SII_Property : SMS_SiteInstallItem   
{  
     String ItemName;  
     String ItemType;  
     String PropertyName;  
     UInt32 Value;  
     String Value1;  
     String Value2;  
};  
```

 The `SMS_SII_Property` class does not define any methods.
