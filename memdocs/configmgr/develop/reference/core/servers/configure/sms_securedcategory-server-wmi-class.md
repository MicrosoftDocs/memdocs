# SMS_SecuredCategory Server WMI Class
The `SMS_SecuredCategory` Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) class is an SMS Provider server class, in Configuration Manager, that represents the RBA security category. An RBA security category defines a set of objects associated with it.  

 The following syntax is simplified from Managed Object Format (MOF) code and includes all inherited properties.  

## Syntax  

```  
Class SMS_SecuredCategory : SMS_BaseClass  
{  
    String CategoryDescription;  
    String CategoryID;  
    String CategoryName;  
    String CreatedBy;  
    DateTime CreatedDate;  
    Boolean IsBuiltIn;  
    String LastModifiedBy;  
    DateTime LastModifiedDate;  
    UInt32 NumberOfAdmins;  
    UInt32 NumberOfObjects;  
    String SourceSite;  
};  
```
