# SMS_SCI_FileDefinition Server WMI Class
The `SMS_SCI_FileDefinition` Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) class is an SMS Provider server class, in Configuration Manager, that represents the basic properties of the site control file.  

> [!NOTE]
>  This class is vital to the operation of the site control infrastructure. Changing the values for an existing site might render the site control file unusable for further configuration. Existing objects for functioning sites should not be changed.  

 The following syntax is simplified from Managed Object Format (MOF) code and includes all inherited properties.  

## Syntax  

```  
Class SMS_SCI_FileDefinition : SMS_SiteControlItem   
{  
     String Comment;  
     UInt32 FileType;  
     String ItemName;  
     String ItemType;  
     String OriginatingSite;  
     UInt32 SerialNumber;  
     String SiteCode;  
     String TargetSite;  
};  
```
