# GetFeatureState Method in Class SMS_Site
The `GetFeatureState` Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) class method, in Configuration Manager, gets the enabled/disabled state of a feature.  

 The following syntax is simplified from Managed Object Format (MOF) code and defines the method.  

## Syntax  

```  
SInt32 GetFeatureState (  
     String SiteCode,  
     UInt32 FeatureID,  
     Boolean IsEnabled  
);  
```  

#### Parameters  
 `SiteCode`  
 Data type: `String`  

 Qualifiers: [in]  

 Site code of site to check. NULL indicates the current site.  

 `FeatureID`  
 Data type: `UInt32`  

 Qualifiers: [in]  

 Feature identifier. Possible values are:  

|||  
|-|-|  
|1|SleepServer|  

 `IsEnabled`  
 Data type: `Boolean`  

 Qualifiers: [out]  

 `true` if the feature is enabled.  

## Return Values  
 An `SInt32` data type that is 0 to indicate success or non-zero to indicate failure.
