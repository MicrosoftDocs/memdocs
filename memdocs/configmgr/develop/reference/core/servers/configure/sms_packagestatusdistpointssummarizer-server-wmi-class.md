# SMS_PackageStatusDistPointsSummarizer Server WMI Class
The `SMS_PackageStatusDistPointsSummarizer` Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) class is an SMS Provider server class, in Configuration Manager, that lists the distribution summary for packages on given site for a given distribution point.  

 The following syntax is simplified from Managed Object Format (MOF) code and includes all inherited properties.  

## Syntax  

```  
Class SMS_PackageStatusDistPointsSummarizer : SMS_BaseClass  
{  
      DateTime LastCopied;  
      String PackageID;  
      UInt32 PackageType;  
      UInt32 SecuredTypeID;  
      String SecureObjectID;  
      String ServerNALPath;  
      String SiteCode;  
      String SourceNALPath;  
      UInt32 SourceVersion;  
      UInt32 State;  
      DateTime SummaryDate;  
};  
```
