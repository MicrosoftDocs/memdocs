# SMS_PDF_Program Server WMI Class
The `SMS_PDF_Program` Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) class is an SMS Provider server class, in Configuration Manager, that represents a package definition file (PDF) template from which to create an initialized program.  

 The following syntax is simplified from Managed Object Format (MOF) code and includes all inherited properties.  

## Syntax  

```  
Class SMS_PDF_Program : SMS_BaseClass  
{  
      String CommandLine;  
      String Comment;  
      String DependentProgram;  
      String Description;  
      String DiskSpaceReq;  
      String DriveLetter;  
      UInt32 Duration;  
      UInt8 Icon[];  
      UInt32 IconSize;  
      UInt32 PDFID;  
      UInt32 ProgramFlags;  
      String ProgramName;  
      String Publisher;  
      String Requirements;  
      String WorkingDirectory;  
};  
```

## Remarks  
 Class qualifiers for this class include:  

- Read (read-only)  

  For more information about both the class qualifiers and the property qualifiers included in the Properties section, see [Configuration Manager Class and Property Qualifiers](../../../../../develop/reference/misc/class-and-property-qualifiers.md).  

  Your application cannot delete individual programs from the package definition file store. To delete a program, the application must delete the package template and then reload the package template without the program.
