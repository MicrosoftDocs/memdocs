# SMS_SCFToSite_a Server WMI Class
The `SMS_SCFToSite_a` Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) class is an SMS Provider server class, in Configuration Manager, that uses the `SiteCode` property to relate [SMS_SiteControlFile Server WMI Class](../../../../../develop/reference/core/servers/configure/sms_sitecontrolfile-server-wmi-class.md) objects to [SMS_Site Server WMI Class](../../../../../develop/reference/core/servers/configure/sms_site-server-wmi-class.md) objects.
