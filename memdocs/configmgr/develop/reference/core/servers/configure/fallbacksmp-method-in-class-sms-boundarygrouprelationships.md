# FallbackSMP Method in Class SMS_BoundaryGroupRelationships
 The `FallbackSMP` Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) class method, in Configuration Manager, sets the fallback time, in minutes, for a state migration point (SMP). The default value is 120.

## Syntax  

```  
SInt32 FallbackSMP();  
```  

### Parameters  
 None.  

## Return Values  
 An `SInt32` data type that is 0 to indicate success or non-zero to indicate failure.  

 For information about handling returned errors, see [About Configuration Manager Errors](../../../../../develop/core/understand/about-configuration-manager-errors.md).
