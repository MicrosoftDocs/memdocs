# SMS_Identification Server WMI Class
The `SMS_Identification` Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) class is an SMS Provider server class, in Configuration Manager, that provides basic information about the installed [SMS_Site Server WMI Class](../../../../../develop/reference/core/servers/configure/sms_site-server-wmi-class.md) object, for example, its language version, site code, and provider. This class should return only one instance.  

 The following syntax is simplified from Managed Object Format (MOF) code and includes all inherited properties.  

## Syntax  

```  
Class SMS_Identification : SMS_BaseClass   
{  
     UInt32 License;  
     UInt32 LocaleID;  
     UInt32 MonthlyReleaseVersion;  
     UInt32 Reserved;  
     String ServiceAccountName;  
     String SMSAvailableConsoleVersion;  
     UInt32 SMSBuildNumber;  
     UInt32 SMSMinBuildNumber;  
     String SMSProviderServer;  
     String SMSSiteServer;  
     String SMSVersion;  
     String ThisSiteCode;  
     String ThisSiteName;  
     String UIManifestHash;  
     String UIManifestHashAlgorithm;  
     String UIUpdateManifestHash;  
     String UIUpdateManifestHashAlgorithm;  
};  
```
