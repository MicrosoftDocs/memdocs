# LoadIconForPDF Method in Class SMS_PDF_Package
The `LoadIconForPDF` Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) class method, in Configuration Manager, imports a required icon for a package definition file.  

 The following syntax is simplified from Managed Object Format (MOF) code and defines the method.  

## Syntax  

```  
SInt32 LoadIconForPDF(  
    UInt32 PDFID,  
     String IconFileName,  
     UInt8 Icon[]  
);  
```  

#### Parameters  
 `PDFID`  
 Data type: `UInt32`  

 Qualifiers: [in]  

 ID of the package definition file to which to add icons. Get this value from the `PDFID` parameter of the [LoadPDF Method in Class SMS_PDF_Package](../../../../../develop/reference/core/servers/configure/loadpdf-method-in-class-sms_pdf_package.md) method.  

 `IconFileName`  
 Data type: `String`  

 Qualifiers: [in, SizeLimit("100")]  

 Full path and file name of a required package definition file icon. Get the icon name from the `RequriedIconNames` parameter of the `LoadPDF` method. Include the path if necessary.  

 `Icon`  
 Data type: `UInt8` Array  

 Qualifiers: [in]  

 Icon to associate with the package.  

## Return Values  
 An `SInt32` data type.  

## Remarks  
 Package definition files can reference icons to be used with the package. These icons are not part of the file and must be loaded separately.  

 Your application must call `LoadIconForPDF` for every icon that [LoadPDF Method in Class SMS_PDF_Package](../../../../../develop/reference/core/servers/configure/loadpdf-method-in-class-sms_pdf_package.md) loads.  

## Example Code  
 For an example that uses the `LoadIconForPDF` method, see [LoadPDF Method in Class SMS_PDF_Package](../../../../../develop/reference/core/servers/configure/loadpdf-method-in-class-sms_pdf_package.md).
