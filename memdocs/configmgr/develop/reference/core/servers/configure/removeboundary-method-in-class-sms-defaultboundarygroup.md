# RemoveBoundary Method in Class SMS_DefaultBoundaryGroup
 The `RemoveBoundary` Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) class method, in Configuration Manager, removes one or more boundaries from a default boundary group.  

 The following syntax is simplified from Managed Object Format (MOF) code and defines the method.

    UInt32 BoundaryID[]   
);  
```  

### Parameters  
 `BoundaryID`  
 Data type: `UInt32` Array

 Qualifiers: [in]  

 Array of boundary IDs.  

## Return Values  
 An `SInt32` data type that is 0 to indicate success or non-zero to indicate failure.  

 For information about handling returned errors, see [About Configuration Manager Errors](../../../../../develop/core/understand/about-configuration-manager-errors.md).
