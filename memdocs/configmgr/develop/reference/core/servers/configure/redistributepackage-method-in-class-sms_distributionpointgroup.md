# ReDistributePackage Method in Class SMS_DistributionPointGroup
The `ReDistributePackage` Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) class method, in Configuration Manager, redistributes a package to all of the member distribution points.  

 The following syntax is simplified from Managed Object Format (MOF) code and defines the method.  

## Syntax  

```  
sint32 ReDistributePackage (  
     string PackageID  
);  
```  

#### Parameters  
 `PackageID`  
 Data type: `String` Array  

 Qualifiers: `[in]`  

 A unique, auto-generated key that is used to relate programs, advertisements, and distribution points to the package.  

## Return Values  
 An  `SInt32` data type that is 0 to indicate success or non-zero to indicate failure.
