# SMS_Advertisement server WMI class
The `SMS_Advertisement` Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) class is an SMS Provider server class, in Configuration Manager, that represents an advertisement used to announce software package programs that are available for running on clients.  

 The following syntax is simplified from Managed Object Format (MOF) code and includes all inherited properties.  

## Syntax  

```  
Class SMS_Advertisement : SMS_BaseClass  
{  
      UInt32 ActionInProgress;  
      UInt32 AdvertFlags;  
      String AdvertisementID;  
      String AdvertisementName;  
      SMS_ScheduleToken AssignedSchedule[];  
      Boolean AssignedScheduleEnabled;  
      Boolean AssignedScheduleIsGMT;  
      UInt32 AssignmentID;  
      String CollectionID;  
      String Comment;

## Properties  
### `ActionInProgress`  
 Data type: `UInt32`  

 Access type: Read-only  

 Qualifiers: [read, enumeration]  

 Current action being performed on the package by Configuration Manager. Possible values are:  

|Value|Description|  
|-----------|-----------------|  
|0|NONE|  
|1|UPDATE|  
|2|ADD|  

### `AdvertFlags`  
 Data type: `UInt32`  

 Access type: Read/Write  

 Qualifiers: [bits]  

 Flags indicating how the advertisement should be announced to the user. Possible values are listed below. The default value is 0.  

|Hexadecimal (Bit)|Description|  
|-------------------------|-----------------|  
|0x00000020 (5)|IMMEDIATE. Announce the advertisement to the user immediately.|  
|0x00000100 (8)|ONSYSTEMSTARTUP. Announce the advertisement to the user on system startup.|  
|0x00000200 (9)|ONUSERLOGON. Announce the advertisement to the user on logon.|  
|0x00000400 (10)|ONUSERLOGOFF. Announce the advertisement to the user on logoff.|  
|0x00001000 (12)|OPTIONALPREDOWNLOAD. If the selected architecture and language matches that of the client, the package content will be downloaded in advance
|0x00008000 (15)|WINDOWS_CE. The advertisement is for a device client.|  
|0x00010000 (16)|ENABLE_PEER_CACHING. This information applies to System Center 2012 Configuration Manager SP1 or later, and System Center 2012 R2 Configuration Manager or later.|  
|0x00020000 (17)|DONOT_FALLBACK. Do not fall back to unprotected distribution points.|  
|0x00040000 (18)|ENABLE_TS_FROM_CD_AND_PXE. The task sequence is available to removable media and the pre-boot execution environment (PXE) service point.|  
|0x00080000 (19)|APTSINTRANETONLY.|
|0x00100000 (20)|OVERRIDE_SERVICE_WINDOWS. Override maintenance windows in announcing the advertisement to the user.|  
|0x00200000 (21)|REBOOT_OUTSIDE_OF_SERVICE_WINDOWS. Reboot outside of maintenance windows.|  
|0x00400000 (22)|WAKE_ON_LAN_ENABLED. Announce the advertisement to the user with Wake On LAN enabled.|  
|0x00800000 (23)|SHOW_PROGRESS. Announce the advertisement to the user showing task sequence progress.|  
|0x02000000 (25)|NO_DISPLAY. The user should not run programs independently of the assignment.|  
|0x04000000 (26)|ONSLOWNET. Assignments are mandatory over a slow network connection.|  
|0x10000000 (28)|TARGETTOWINPE. Target this deployment to WinPE only.|
|0x20000000 (29)|HIDDENINWINPE. Target this deployment to WinPE only but hide in WinPE. It can only be used by TS variable _SMSTSPreferredAdvertID_.

 These flags must be coordinated with the flags that are specified in the `ProgramFlags` property of the advertised program. For example, if you set ONUSERLOGOFF, the NOUSERLOGGEDIN flag in the program must be set. If the flag settings do not match, the program is not advertised. For more information, see [SMS_Program Server WMI Class](../../../../../develop/reference/core/servers/configure/sms_program-server-wmi-class.md).  

 Setting IMMEDIATE, ONUSERLOGON, or ONUSERLOGOFF or providing an `AssignedSchedule` value makes the advertised program mandatory. A mandatory program is run automatically after the client has received the advertisement. The client cannot reject or postpone the installation.  

 Set the NO_DISPLAY and ONSLOWNET bits only when the IMMEDIATE, ONUSERLOGON, or ONUSERLOGOFF bit is set or the program has an `AssignedSchedule` value.  

 Set NO_DISPLAY when you do not want the user to run programs independently of the assignment. If you do not set this flag, the advertisement is shown in the list of advertisements and can be run independently of the assignment. The program can still be mandatory.  

 Set ONSLOWNET when assignments are mandatory over a slow network connection, for example, when a computer connects using a modem.

## Remarks  
 Class qualifiers for this class include:  

- Secured  

  For more information about both the class qualifiers and the property qualifiers included in the Properties section, see [Configuration Manager Class and Property Qualifiers](../../../../../develop/reference/misc/class-and-property-qualifiers.md).  

  Although there are no other key properties, the properties `AdvertisementName`, `CollectionID`, `PackageID`, and `ProgramName` are qualified as NOT_NULL, and values must be supplied. Your application cannot update these properties after a class instance is created. To change these values, the application must delete the instance and create a new instance with the correct values.
