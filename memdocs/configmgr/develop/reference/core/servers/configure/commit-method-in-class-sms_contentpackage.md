# Commit Method in Class SMS_ContentPackage
The `Commit` Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) class method, in Configuration Manager, indicates that the content package is ready for processing.

## Syntax  

```  
sint32 Commit();  
```  

#### Parameters  
 None.  

## Remarks  
 This method needs to be called when all the contents have been added to the content package to start package processing.  

## Return Values  
 An `SInt32` data type that is 0 to indicate success or non-zero to indicate failure.
