# SMS_ST_RecurInterval Server WMI Class
The `SMS_ST_RecurInterval` Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) class is an SMS Provider server class, in Configuration Manager, that represents a schedule token for events that occur at regular intervals, for example, every 10 days.  

 The following syntax is simplified from Managed Object Format (MOF) code and includes all inherited properties.  

## Syntax  

```  
Class SMS_ST_RecurInterval : SMS_ScheduleToken  
{  
      UInt32 DayDuration;  
      UInt32 DaySpan;  
      UInt32 HourDuration;  
      UInt32 HourSpan;  
      Boolean IsGMT;  
      UInt32 MinuteDuration;  
      UInt32 MinuteSpan;  
      DateTime StartTime;  
};  
```
