# GetAllUpdatesUserExperience Method in Class CCM_SoftwareUpdatesManager
The `GetAllUpdatesUserExperience` WMI class method, in Configuration Manager, gets the user experience mode that determines how software updates are displayed on a target computer.  

> [!NOTE]
>  This method can be used to hide or show all software updates in software center.  

 The following syntax is simplified from Managed Object Format (MOF) code and defines the method.  

## Syntax  

```  
UInt32 GetAllUpdatesUserExperience(  
     [OUT] UInt32 UserExperience  
);  
```  

#### Parameters  
 `UserExperience`  
 Data type: `UInt32`  

 Qualifiers: [out]  

 The user experience mode. The following table shows the possible user experience mode values.  

|Value|User experience|  
|-----------|---------------------|  
|0|DEFAULT (per policy)|  
|1|INTERACTIVE|  
|2|QUIET|  

## Return Values  
 A `UInt32` data type that is 0 to indicate success or nonzero to indicate failure.  

 For information about handling returned errors, see [About Configuration Manager Errors](../../../../../develop/core/understand/about-configuration-manager-errors.md).  

## Remarks  
 This method is only available for local administrators. When a software update deployment has been prepared and software updates are available for installation, this method and the `SetAllUpdatesUserExperience` method can be used to configure the user experience.
