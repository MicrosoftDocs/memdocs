# CCM_SoftwareBase Client WMI Class
The `CCM_SoftwareBase` Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) class is an SMS Provider server class, in Configuration Manager, that represents the base class for management entities like software updates. applications and so on. This class contains the common properties across these management entities. This class is listed here for completeness and to show the base class properties which derived classes would inherit. Client SDK users will always use the specific derived classes of interest to achieve the functionality.  

> [!IMPORTANT]
>  The software update client side SDK will only return set of updates which are deployed to client from Configuration Manager site server, and are applicable, and are yet to be installed on the client.  

 The following syntax is simplified from Managed Object Format (MOF) code and includes all inherited properties.  

## Syntax  

```  
Class CCM_SoftwareBase :    
{  
    UInt32 ContentSize;  
    DateTime Deadline;  
    String Description;  
    UInt32 ErrorCode;  
    UInt32 EstimatedInstallTime;  
    UInt32 EvaluationState;  
    String FullName;  
    String Name;  
    DateTime NextUserScheduledTime;  
    UInt32 PercentComplete;  
    String Publisher;  
    UInt32 Type;  
};  
```
