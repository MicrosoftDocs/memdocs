# CCM_SoftwareUpdatesManager Client WMI Class
The `CCM_SoftwareUpdatesManager` WMI class is a client class, in Configuration Manager, that exposes methods to install, schedule and other actions on set of software updates.  

 This interface is equivalent to the ICCMUpdatesDeployment COM interface in the Configuration Manager 2007 SDK.
