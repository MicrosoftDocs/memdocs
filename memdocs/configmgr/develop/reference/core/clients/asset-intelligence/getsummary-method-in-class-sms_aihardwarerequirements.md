# GetSummary Method in Class SMS_AIHardwareRequirements
The `GetSummary` Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) class method, in Configuration Manager, provides a summary count of validated and user-defined state items in the `SMS_AIHardwareRequirements` class.  

 The following syntax is simplified from Managed Object Format (MOF) code and defines the method.  

## Syntax  

```  
SInt32 GetSummary(      
     UInt32 Validated,  
     UInt32 UserDefined  
);  
```  

#### Parameters  
 `Validated`  
 Data type: `UInt32`  

 Qualifiers: [out]  

 Count of Microsoft-defined items.  

 `UserDefined`  
 Data type: `UInt32`  

 Qualifiers: [out]  

 Count of user-defined items.  

## Return Values  
 An `SInt32` data type that is 0 to indicate success or non-zero to indicate failure.  

 For information about handling returned errors, see [About Configuration Manager Errors](../../../../../develop/core/understand/about-configuration-manager-errors.md).
