# SetCategorizationRequest Method in Class SMS_AISoftwareList
The `SetCategorizationRequest` Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) class method, in Configuration Manager, initiates a System Center Online software categorization request.  

 The following syntax is simplified from Managed Object Format (MOF) code and defines the method.

SInt32 SetCategorizationRequest(      
     String SoftwareKey,  
);  
```  

#### Parameters  
 `SoftwareKey`  
 Data type: `String`  

 Qualifiers: [in]  

 Hash of the software to be categorized. After this method is called, the hash is sent to the System Center Online server to be categorized during its next release.  

 This property name has changed from `SoftwarePropertiesHash` to `SoftwareKey` in SP1.  

## Return Values  
 An `SInt32` data type that is 0 to indicate success or non-zero to indicate failure.
