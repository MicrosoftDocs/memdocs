# SMS_AISoftwareList Server WMI Class
The `SMS_AISoftwareList` Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) class, in Configuration Manager, contains all the known software titles in the Asset Intelligence catalog.  

 The following syntax is simplified from Managed Object Format (MOF) code and includes all inherited properties.  

## Syntax  

```  
Class SMS_AISoftwareList : SMS_BaseClass   
{   
      uint32 CategoryID;   
      string CategoryName;   
      string CommonName;   
      string CommonPublisher;   
      string CommonVersion;   
      uint32 Count; (obsolete in SP1)   
      uint32 FamilyID;   
      string FamilyName;   
      string OfficialCategoryName;   
      string OfficialFamilyName;   
      string SoftwareCode; (obsolete in SP1)  
      uint32 SoftwareCount;   
      string SoftwareID; (obsolete in SP1)  
      string SoftwareKey;   
      string SoftwarePropertiesHash; (obsolete in SP1)  
      uint32 State;   
      uint32 Tag1ID;   
      string Tag1Name;   
      uint32 Tag2ID;   
      string Tag2Name;   
      uint32 Tag3ID;   
      string Tag3Name;   
};  
```
