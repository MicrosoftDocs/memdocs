# SMS_AIProxy server WMI class

The `SMS_AIProxy` Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) class is an SMS Provider server class, in Configuration Manager, that represents an Asset Intelligence proxy computer.  

> [!NOTE]
> This class can be accessed only on the central administration site.  

 The following syntax is simplified from Managed Object Format (MOF) code and includes all inherited properties.  

## Syntax  

```
Class SMS_AIProxy : SMS_BaseClass   
{   
      string CatalogWatermark;   
      uint32 CategoryChangeCount;   
      uint32 CPUChangeCount;   
      uint32 HWReqChangeCount;   
      datetime LastCatalogUpdateCompletion;   
      datetime LastCatalogUpdateRequest;   
      uint32 LastSCOReturnCode;   
      boolean PeriodicCatalogUpdateEnabled;   
      string PeriodicCatalogUpdateSchedule;   
      uint32 Port;   
      string ProxyCertPath;   
      boolean ProxyEnabled;   
      string ProxyName;   
      uint32 ProxyPollingInterval;   
      uint32 ProxyState;   
      boolean RelevancyOptOut;   
      string SCOURL;   
      string SiteCode;    
      uint32 SoftwareTitlesChangeCount;   
};  
```  

## Methods

The following table lists the methods in the `SMS_AIProxy` class.

|Method|Description|
