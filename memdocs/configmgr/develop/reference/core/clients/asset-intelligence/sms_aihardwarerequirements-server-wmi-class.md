# SMS_AIHardwareRequirements Server WMI Class
The `SMS_AIHardwareRequirements` Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) class, in Configuration Manager, associates a software title with hardware requirements.  

 The following syntax is simplified from Managed Object Format (MOF) code and includes all inherited properties.  

## Syntax  

```  
Class SMS_AIHardwareRequirements : SMS_BaseClass   
{   
      boolean IsLocal;   
      uint32 MinCPU;   
      sint64 MinDiskFree;   
      sint64 MinDiskSize;   
      sint64 MinRAM;   
      string Product;   
      uint32 State;   
};  
```  

## Methods  
 The following table lists the methods in the `SMS_AIHardwareRequirements` class.  

|Method|Description|  
|------------|-----------------|  
|[GetSummary Method in Class SMS_AIHardwareRequirements](../../../../../develop/reference/core/clients/asset-intelligence/getsummary-method-in-class-sms_aihardwarerequirements.md)|Retrieves a summary of all class instances based on the State property of the class.|
