# SMS_ClientSettingsBase Server WMI Class
The `SMS_ClientSettingsBase` Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) class is an SMS Provider server class, in Configuration Manager, that represents  the base class used by several client settings related classes (`SMS_AntimalwareSettings`, `SMS_ClientSettings`, and so on) for their simple properties.  

 The following syntax is simplified from Managed Object Format (MOF) code and includes all inherited properties.  

## Syntax  

```  
Class SMS_ClientSettingsBase : SMS_BaseClass  
{  
    UInt32 AssignmentCount;  
    String CreatedBy;  
    DateTime DateCreated;  
    DateTime DateModified;  
    String Description;  
    Boolean Enabled;  
    UInt32 Flags;  
    String LastModifiedBy;  
    String Name;  
    UInt32 Priority;  
    String SecuredScopeNames[];  
    UInt32 SettingsID;  
    UInt32 Type;  
    String UniqueID;  
};  
```  

## Methods  
 The `SMS_ClientSettingsBase` class does not define any methods.  

## Properties  
 `AssignmentCount`  
 Data type: `UInt32`

 Name of the user who created the client settings.  

 `DateCreated`  
 Data type: `DateTime`  

 Access type: Read-only  

 Qualifiers: [notnull, read]  

 The date and time when the client settings are created.  

 `DateModified`

 Access type: Read-only  

 Qualifiers: [notnull, read]  

 The date and time when the client settings are modified.  

 `Description`

 An administrator generated description describing the settings configuration.  

 `Enabled`  
 Data type: `Boolean`  

 Access type: Read/Write  

 Qualifiers: [notnull]  

 `true` if the agent is enabled.  

 `Flags`  
 Data type: `UInt32`  

 Access type: Read/Write  

 Qualifiers: [notnull]  

 Reserved for future use.  

 `LastModifiedBy`  
 Data type: `String`  

 Access type: Read-only

 Data type: `String`  

 Access type: Read/Write  

 Qualifiers: [notnull]  

 The name of the component.

 Priority is used by the client to decide which value to take if the client belongs to more than one collection and multiple collections have client settings defined. The higher the number, the lower the relative priority to the client. All settings should have different priority numbers. The default value is the next available priority number.
