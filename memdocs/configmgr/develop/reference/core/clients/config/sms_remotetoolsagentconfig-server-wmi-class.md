 The following syntax is simplified from Managed Object Format (MOF) code and includes all inherited properties.  

## Syntax  

```  
Class SMS_RemoteToolsAgentConfig : SMS_ClientAgentConfig_BaseClass  
{  
    UInt32 AccessLevel;  
    UInt32 AgentID;  
    Boolean AllowClientChange;  
    Boolean AllowLocalAdminToDoRemoteControl;  
    Boolean AllowRAUnsolicitedControl;  
    Boolean AllowRAUnsolicitedView;  
    Boolean AllowRemCtrlToUnattended;  
    UInt32 AudibleSignal;  
    Boolean Enabled;  
    Boolean EnableRA;  
    Boolean EnableTS;  
    Boolean EnforceRAandTSSettings;  
    UInt32 FirewallExceptionProfiles;  
    Boolean ManageRA;  
    Boolean ManageTS;  
    Boolean PermissionRequired;  
    String PermittedViewers[];  
    Boolean RemCtrlConnectionBar;  
    Boolean RemCtrlTaskbarIcon;  
    Boolean TSUserAuthentication;  
};  
```
