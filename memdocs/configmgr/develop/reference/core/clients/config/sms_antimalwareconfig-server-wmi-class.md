|-|-|  
|(0x0)|Disabled (default)|  
|(0x1)|Basic membership|  
|(0x2)|Advanced membership|  

 Basic membership will send basic information to Microsoft about software that has been detected, including where the software came from, the actions that you apply or that are applied automatically, and whether the actions were successful.  

 Advanced membership, in addition to basic information, will send more information to Microsoft about malicious software, spyware, and potentially unwanted software, including the location of the software, file names, how the software operates, and how it has impacted your computer.

 Data type: `UInt32`  

 Access type: Read/Write  

 Qualifiers: none  

 This policy setting allows you to specify an interval at which to check for definition updates when  `SignatureUpdateDay` is 0. The time value is represented as the number of hours between update checks. Valid values range from 1 (every hour) to 24 (once per day).  

 If you enable this setting, checks for definition updates will occur at the interval specified.  

 If you disable or do not configure this setting, checks for definition updates will occur at the default interval.  

 `SignatureUpdateTime`  
 Data type: `UInt32`  

 Access type: Read/Write

 This policy setting allows you to specify the time of day at which to check for definition updates when `SignatureUpdateDay` is not 0. The time value is represented as the number of minutes past midnight (00:00).  For example, 120 (0x78) is equivalent to 02:00 AM. By default this setting is configured to check for definition updates 15 minutes before the scheduled scan time. The schedule is based on local time on the computer where the check is occurring.  

 If you enable this setting, the check for definition updates will occur at the time of day specified.  

 If you disable or do not configure this setting, the check for definition updates will occur at the default time.
