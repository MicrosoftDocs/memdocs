# SMS_SoftwareDistributionAgentConfig Server WMI Class
The `SMS_SoftwareDistributionAgentConfig` Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) class is an SMS Provider server class, in Configuration Manager, that specifies how client computers deploy software.  

 The following syntax is simplified from Managed Object Format (MOF) code and includes all inherited properties.  

## Syntax  

```  
Class SMS_SoftwareDistributionAgentConfig : SMS_ClientAgentConfig_BaseClass  
{  
    UInt32 AgentID;  
    UInt32 CacheContentTimeout;  
    UInt32 CacheSpaceFailureRetryCount;  
    UInt32 CacheSpaceFailureRetryInterval;  
    UInt32 CacheTombstoneContentMinDuration;  
    UInt32 ContentLocationTimeoutInterval;  
    UInt32 ContentLocationTimeoutRetryCount;  
    UInt32 DefaultMaxDuration;  
    Boolean DisplayNewProgramNotification;  
    UInt32 DownloadModificationInterval;  
    UInt32 DownloadRetryInterval;  
    UInt32 ExecutionFailureRetryCount;  
    UInt32 ExecutionFailureRetryErrorCodes[];  
    UInt32 ExecutionFailureRetryInterval;  
    Boolean LockSettings;  
    UInt32 LogoffReturnCodes[];  
    UInt32 NetworkFailureRetryCount;  
    UInt32 NetworkFailureRetryInterval;  
    String NewProgramNotificationUI;  
    Boolean RebootLogoffNotification;  
    UInt32 RebootReturnCodes[];  
    Boolean RunNotification;  
    UInt32 RunNotificationCountdownDuration;  
    UInt32 SuccessReturnCodes[];  
    UInt32 UIContentLocationTimeoutInterval;  
    UInt32 UserPreemptionCountdown;  
    UInt32 UserPreemptionTimeout;  
    UInt32 WhatsNewDuration;  
};  
```
