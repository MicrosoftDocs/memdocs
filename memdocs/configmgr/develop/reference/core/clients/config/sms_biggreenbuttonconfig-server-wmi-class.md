# SMS_BigGreenButtonConfig Server WMI Class
The `SMS_BigGreenButtonConfig` Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) class is an SMS Provider server class, in Configuration Manager, that can stop clients from connecting to the client notification server (a hidden role, co-located with management point).  

 The following syntax is simplified from Managed Object Format (MOF) code and includes all inherited properties.  

## Syntax  

```  
Class SMS_BigGreenButtonConfig : SMS_ClientAgentConfig_BaseClass  
{  
    UInt32 AgentID;  
    Boolean EnableClientNotification;  
};  
```  

## Methods  
 The `SMS_BigGreenButtonConfig` class does not define any methods.  

## Properties  
 `AgentID`  
 Data type: `UInt32`  

 Access type: Read-only  

 Qualifiers: [key, read]  

 Identifies the client agent component. The BigGreenButton Agent ID is 18.  

 `EnableClientNotification`  
 Data type: `Boolean`  

 Access type: Read/Write  

 Qualifiers: none  

 `false` to stop clients from connecting to the client notification server (a hidden role, co-located with management point). No active connections will be established between the clients and the client notification server. The default value is `true`.  

 This setting is part of the client infrastructure and turned on by default. This value would likely only be changed to troubleshoot a significant performance issue.
