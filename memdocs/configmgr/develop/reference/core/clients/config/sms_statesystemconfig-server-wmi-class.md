 The following syntax is simplified from Managed Object Format (MOF) code and includes all inherited properties.  

## Syntax  

```  
Class SMS_StateSystemConfig : SMS_ClientAgentConfig_BaseClass  
{  
    UInt32 AgentID;  
    UInt32 BulkSendInterval;  
    UInt32 BulkSendIntervalHigh;  
    UInt32 BulkSendIntervalLow;  
    String CacheCleanoutInterval;  
    UInt32 CacheMaxAge;  
};  
```  

## Methods  
 The `SMS_StateSystemConfig` class does not define any methods.
