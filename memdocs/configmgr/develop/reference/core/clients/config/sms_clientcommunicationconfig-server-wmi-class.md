# SMS_ClientCommunicationConfig Server WMI Class
The `SMS_ClientCommunicationConfig` Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) class is an SMS Provider server class, in Configuration Manager, that controls how Windows 8 client computers communicate with Configuration Manager sites when they use metered Internet connections.  

 The following syntax is simplified from Managed Object Format (MOF) code and includes all inherited properties.  

## Syntax  

```  
Class SMS_ClientCommunicationConfig : SMS_ClientAgentConfig_BaseClass  
{  
    UInt32 AgentID;  
    UInt32 MeteredNetworkUsage;  
};  
```  

## Methods  
 The `SMS_ClientCommunicationConfig` class does not define any methods.  

## Properties  
 `MeteredNetworkUsage`  
 Data type: `UInt32`  

 Access type: Read/Write  

 Qualifiers: none  

 Set metered network usage behavior. Possible values are:  

|||  
|-|-|  
|1|Allow metered network use.|  
|2|Only use the metered network for deployments that are marked to allow use of the metered network. This means meta-data such as policy will always use the metered network. And based on the policy, the client will decide whether or not to use the metered network for the deployment.|  
|4|Block metered network usage.|
