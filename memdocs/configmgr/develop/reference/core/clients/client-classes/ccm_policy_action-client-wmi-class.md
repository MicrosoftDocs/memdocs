# CCM_Policy_Action Client WMI Class
In Configuration Manager, the `CCM_Policy_Action` class is a client Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) class that represents settings for a policy action.  

 The following syntax is simplified from Managed Object Format (MOF) code and includes all inherited properties.  

## Syntax  

```  
Class CCM_Policy_Action : CCM_Policy_Config  
{  
      String ActionData;  
      String ActionType;  
};  
```  

## Methods  
 The `CCM_Policy_Action` class does not define any methods.  

## Properties  
 `ActionData`  
 Data type: `String`  

 Access type: Read/Write  

 Qualifiers: [Not_Null:ToInstance]  

 Handler-specific data and policy settings defined in MOF to be compiled directly into the appropriate `RequestedConfig` namespace. The MOF text should only contain object definitions and should not include any class definitions or #pragma statements.  

 `ActionType`  
 Data type: `String`  

 Access type: Read/Write  

 Qualifiers: [Not_Null:ToInstance]  

 The type of the action, which must map to a registered action handler. The default value is WMI-MOF.  

## Remarks  
 This class is only used to support objects reflected in the `RuleActions` property in [CCM_Policy_Rule Client WMI Class](../../../../../develop/reference/core/clients/client-classes/ccm_policy_rule-client-wmi-class.md).
