# CCM_Service_IISConfiguration Client WMI Class
In Configuration Manager, the `CCM_Service_IISConfiguration` class is a client Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) class that supports Internet Information Services (IIS)-related settings used by CCMEXEC for staging and receiving message payloads on a Management Point.  

 The following syntax is simplified from Managed Object Format (MOF) code and includes all inherited properties.  

## Syntax  

```  
Class CCM_Service_IISConfiguration : CCM_Policy  
{  
      UInt8 Dummy[key]  ;  
      String IncomingPayloadDir;  
      String IncomingPayloadVirtualDir;  
      String OutgoingPayloadDir;  
      String OutgoingPayloadVirtualDir;  
      String PolicyID;  
      String PolicyInstanceID;  
      UInt32 PolicyPrecedence;  
      String PolicyRuleID;  
      String PolicySource;  
      String PolicyVersion;  
};  
```  

## Methods  
 The `CCM_Service_IISConfiguration` class does not define any methods.  

## Properties  
 `Dummy[key]`  
 Data type: `UInt8`  

 Access type: Read/Write  

 Qualifiers: [Realkey]  

 Dummy key.  

 `IncomingPayloadDir`  
 Data type: `String`  

 Access type: Read/Write  

 Qualifiers: None  

 Directory where message payloads are uploaded to the server by clients. The System and Administrators account must have full access to this directory. In addition, the appropriate permissions must be given to allow clients to upload to this directory by means of IIS using the BITS ISAPI component. This directory must be created at install time; it is not automatically created by the service.  

 `IncomingPayloadVirtualDir`  
 Data type: `String`  

 Access type: Read/Write  

 Qualifiers: None  

 IIS virtual directory mapped to **IncomingPayloadDir**.  

 `OutgoingPayloadDir`  
 Data type: `String`  

 Access type: Read/Write  

 Qualifiers: None  

 Directory that is used to hold message payloads that will be downloaded by clients.  

 `OutgoingPayloadVirtualDir`  
 Data type: `String`  

 Access type: Read/Write  

 Qualifiers: None  

 IIS virtual directory mapped to **OutgoingPayloadDir**.  

 `PolicyID`  
 Data type: `String`  

 Access type: Read/Write  

 Qualifiers: [key]  

 See [CCM_Policy Client WMI Class](../../../../../develop/reference/core/clients/client-classes/ccm_policy-client-wmi-class.md).  

 `PolicyInstanceID`  
 Data type: `String`  

 Access type: Read/Write  

 Qualifiers: [key]  

 See [CCM_Policy Client WMI Class](../../../../../develop/reference/core/clients/client-classes/ccm_policy-client-wmi-class.md).  

 `PolicyPrecedence`  
 Data type: `UInt32`  

 Access type: Read/Write  

 Qualifiers: None  

 See [CCM_Policy Client WMI Class](../../../../../develop/reference/core/clients/client-classes/ccm_policy-client-wmi-class.md).  

 `PolicyRuleID`  
 Data type: `String`  

 Access type: Read/Write  

 Qualifiers: [key]  

 See [CCM_Policy Client WMI Class](../../../../../develop/reference/core/clients/client-classes/ccm_policy-client-wmi-class.md).  

 `PolicySource`  
 Data type: `String`  

 Access type: Read/Write  

 Qualifiers: [key]  

 See [CCM_Policy Client WMI Class](../../../../../develop/reference/core/clients/client-classes/ccm_policy-client-wmi-class.md).  

 `PolicyVersion`  
 Data type: `String`  

 Access type: Read/Write  

 Qualifiers: [key]  

 See [CCM_Policy Client WMI Class](../../../../../develop/reference/core/clients/client-classes/ccm_policy-client-wmi-class.md).  

## Remarks  
 An instance of this class should exist only if IIS has been configured to work with CCMEXEC, that is, IIS must be installed and the appropriate physical and virtual directories must be set up correctly. If this instance is omitted, CCMEXEC operates without using IIS, thus losing some functionality.
