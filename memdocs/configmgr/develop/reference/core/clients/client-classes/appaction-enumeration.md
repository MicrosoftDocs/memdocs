# AppAction Enumeration
In Configuration Manager, the `AppAction` enumeration defines action types. This enumeration is used by the [IAppManagmentTypes Interface](../../../../../develop/reference/core/clients/client-classes/iappmanagementtypes-interface.md).  

## Syntax  

```  
typedef enum AppAction  
{  
    appDiscovery = 0,   
    appInstall = 1,   
    appUninstall = 2  
}AppAction;  
```  

## Elements  
 `appDiscovery`  
 The action type is discovery.  

 `appInstall`  
 The action type is install.  

 `appUninstall`
