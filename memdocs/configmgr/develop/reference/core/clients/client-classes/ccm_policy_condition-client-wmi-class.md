# CCM_Policy_Condition Client WMI Class
In Configuration Manager, the `CCM_Policy_Condition` class is a client Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) class that represents a policy condition.  

 The following syntax is simplified from Managed Object Format (MOF) code and includes all inherited properties.  

## Syntax  

```  
Class CCM_Policy_Condition : CCM_Policy_Config  
{  
      String ConditionID;  
      Boolean ConditionState;  
      Object ConditionExpression;  
};  
```  

## Properties  
 `ConditionID`  
 Data type: `Boolean`  

 Access type: Read-only  

 Qualifiers: [key]  

 Condition ID.  

 `ConditionState`  
 Data type: `Boolean`  

 Access type: Read-only  

 Qualifiers: [read]  

 Current state of the condition. This value indicates the result of the last condition evaluation, or it is `null` if the condition has never been evaluated.  

 `ConditionExpression`  
 Data type: `Object`  

 Access type: Read-only  

 Qualifiers: [read]  

 Actual expression to evaluate. The value is a [CCM_Policy_Expression Client WMI Class](../../../../../develop/reference/core/clients/client-classes/ccm_policy_expression-client-wmi-class.md) object for a simple expression or a [CCM_Policy_Operator Client WMI Class](../../../../../develop/reference/core/clients/client-classes/ccm_policy_operator-client-wmi-class.md) object for a compound expression.
