# CCM_Service_HostedClass Client WMI Class
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  This class supports the Configuration Manager 2007 infrastructure and is not intended to be used directly from your code.  

 in Configuration Manager, the `CCM_Service_HostedClass` class is a client Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) class that configures a COM class to be hosted in the CCMEXEC service.  

 The following syntax is simplified from Managed Object Format (MOF) code and includes all inherited properties.  

## Syntax  

```  
Class CCM_Service_HostedClass : CCM_Policy  
{  
      String CLSID;  
      String Description;  
      String PolicyID;  
      String PolicyInstanceID;  
      UInt32 PolicyPrecedence;  
      String PolicyRuleID;  
      String PolicySource;  
      String PolicyVersion;  
};  
```
