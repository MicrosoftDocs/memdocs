# IDCMSDK::GetAssignedBaselines Method
The `IDCMSDK::GetAssignedBaselines` method, in Configuration Manager, enumerates assigned baseline configuration items.  

## Syntax  

```  
[IDL]  
HRESULT GetAssignedBaselines(  
     IEnumUnknown**  ppEnum,  
     ULONG*  pulNumCIs,  
     struct CIDetectInfo**  ppInfo  
);  
```  

#### Parameters  
 `ppEnum`  
 Data type: `IEnumUnknown`  

 Qualifiers: [out]  

 Pointer to a pointer to an enumeration object containing an [ICIINFO Interface](../../../../../develop/reference/core/clients/client-classes/iciinfo-interface.md) for each baseline configuration item currently assigned and downloaded to the client.  

 `pulNumCIs`  
 Data type: `ULONG`  

 Qualifiers: [out]  

 Pointer to the number of baseline configuration items. On successful return from the method, this parameter also indicates the number of other configuration items currently assigned to the client.  

 `ppInfo`  
 Data type: `struct`  

 Qualifiers: [out, size_is(,*pulNumCIs)]  

 Pointer to a pointer to a [CIDetectInfo Structure](../../../../../develop/reference/core/clients/client-classes/cidetectinfo-structure.md) containing information for each baseline configuration item that is assigned but not downloaded.  

## Return Values  
 An `HRESULT` code. Possible values include, but are not limited to, the following:  

 S_OK  
 The method succeeded. All other values indicate failure.
