# ResetPolicy Method in Class SMS_Client
In Configuration Manager, the `ResetPolicy` method, resets the policy on a client. As a result, the next policy request will receive a full policy instead of merely the change in policy since the last policy request.  

 The following syntax is simplified from Managed Object Format (MOF) code and defines the method.  

## Syntax  

```  
UInt32 ResetPolicy(  
     UInt32 uFlags  
);  
```  

#### Parameters  
 `uFlags`  
 Data type: `UInt32`  

 Qualifiers: [in]  

 Flags identifying the policy. Possible values are:  

|||  
|-|-|  
|0|The next policy request will be for a full policy instead of the change in policy since the last policy request.|  
|1|The existing policy will be purged completely.|  

## Return Values  
 A `UInt32` data type that is 0 to indicate success or non-zero to indicate failure.  

## Remarks  
 Indiscriminate calling of this method could have adverse affects. For example, if you purge the existing policy (`ulFlags` = 1) software distribution programs could be run more than once. If the request is for full policy (`ulFlags` = 0), you could generate unnecessary network traffic.
