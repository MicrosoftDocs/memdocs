# CCM_Policy_Expression Client WMI Class
In Configuration Manager, the `CCM_Policy_Expression` class is a client Windows Management Instruementation (WMI) class that represents a policy expression that evaluates to either `true` or `false`.  

 The following syntax is simplified from Managed Object Format (MOF) code and includes all inherited properties.  

## Syntax  

```  
Class CCM_Policy_Expression : CCM_Policy_Config  
{  
      String ExpressionData;  
      String ExpressionLanguage;  
      Boolean ExpressionState;  
      String ExpressionType;  
};  
```  

## Methods  
 The `CCM_Policy_Expression` class does not define any methods.  

## Properties  
 `ExpressionData`  
 Data type: `String`  

 Access type: Read/Write  

 Qualifiers: [Not_Null:ToInstance]  

 Data representing the expression to evaluate. The actual format is specific to the expression type. For more information, see `ExpressionType`.  

 `ExpressionLanguage`  
 Data type: `String`  

 Access type: Read/Write  

 Qualifiers: [Not_Null:ToInstance]  

 The type of expression, which must map to an object that contains information about the handler responsible for evaluating this expression type.  

 `ExpressionState`  
 Data type: `Boolean`  

 Access type: Read/Write  

 Qualifiers: None  

 Current state of the expression. This value indicates the result of the last expression evaluation, or `null` if the expression has never been evaluated.  

 `ExpressionType`  
 Data type: `String`  

 Access type: Read/Write  

 Qualifiers: [Not_Null:ToInstance]  

 Type that determines how the expression is evaluated. Possible values are:  

|||  
|-|-|  
|Once|The expression is evaluated only once.|  
|Until-true|The expression continues to be re-evaluated until evaluation returns `true`.|  
|Continuous|The expression is always re-evaluated.|
