# Configuration Manager Client Infrastructure
This section provides reference information for the Configuration Manager client infrastructure, including Control Panel, client framework and data transfer, and policy functionality.  

## In This Section  
 Client Control Panel COM Automation  
 > [!IMPORTANT]
>  The Client Control Panel COM Automation interface has been removed or deprecated in Configuration Manager SP1. Use the feature-related client WMI class instead.

[Client Framework and Data Transfer Client WMI Classes](#client-framework-and-data-transfer-client-wmi-classes) describes the Client Configuration Manager (CCM) framework and data transfer classes in Configuration Manager for the client.

[Policy Agent Client WMI Classes](#policy-agent-client-wmi-classes) describes the classes used to manage policy on client computers and devices.
