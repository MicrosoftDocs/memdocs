# CCM_Scheduler_History Client WMI Class
In Configuration Manager, the `CCM_Scheduler_History` class is a client Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) class that represents the history for a schedule.  

 The following syntax is simplified from Managed Object Format (MOF) code and includes all inherited properties.  

## Syntax  

```  
Class CCM_Scheduler_History {  
      String  ScheduleID;  
      String  UserSID;  
      DateTime  FirstEvalTime;  
      DateTime  ActivationMessageSent;  
      Boolean  ActivationMessageSentIsGMT;  
      DateTime  ExpirationMessageSent;  
      Boolean  ExpirationMessageSentIsGMT;     
      DateTime  LastTriggerTime;  
      String  TriggerState;  
};  
```  

## Properties  
 `ScheduleID`  
 Data type: `String`  

 Access type: Read-only  

 Qualifiers: [Not_Null:ToInstance, Key]

 Qualifiers: None  

 Last time the activation message was sent for the schedule.  

 `ActivationMessageSentIsGMT`  
 Data type: `Boolean`
