# SMS_InstalledExecutable Client WMI Class
The `SMS_InstalledExecutable` class is a client Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) class, in Configuration Manager, that identifies executable files associated with a software installation.  

 The following syntax is simplified from Managed Object Format (MOF) code and includes all inherited properties.  

## Syntax  

```  
Class SMS_InstalledExecutable  
{  
      String BinFileVersion;  
      String BinProductVersion;  
      String Description;  
      String ExecutableName;  
      String FilePropertiesHash;  
      String FilePropertiesHashEx;  
      UInt32 FileSize;  
      String FileVersion;  
      Boolean HasPatchAdded;  
      String InstalledFilePath;  
      Boolean IsSystemFile;  
      Boolean IsVitalFile;  
      UInt32 Language;  
      String Product;  
      String ProductCode;  
      String ProductVersion;  
      String Publisher;  
};  
```  

## Methods  
 The `SMS_InstalledExecutable` class does not define any methods.

 A unique 128-bit signature that is derived from a combination of the `Product`, `Description`, `ProductVersion`, `Publisher`, and `FileName` properties of the file.  

 `FilePropertiesHashEx`  
 Data type: `String`  

 Access type: Read-only  

 Qualifiers: None

## Remarks  

> [!NOTE]
>  This class is not currently used to support existing Asset Intelligence reports. However, it can be enabled to support custom reports.  

 This class identifies executable files associated with a software installation to:  

- Confirm that the application is installed by looking at Configuration Manager file inventory.  

- Indicate what metering rules, based on the executable files, have to be set to meter the application.  

- Perform an application impact analysis.  

  Because the Windows Installer (.msi) file contains a record of the installed executable files, it can be used as the source for the mapping between installed applications and executable files.  

  This class retrieves data from two sources. For each [SMS_InstalledSoftware Client WMI Class](../../../../../develop/reference/core/clients/client-classes/sms_installedsoftware-client-wmi-class.md) object, the class identifies the .msi package by looking in the `LocalPackage` property, and queries the .msi database for all .exe and .com files.  

  For any [SMS_InstalledSoftware Client WMI Class](../../../../../develop/reference/core/clients/client-classes/sms_installedsoftware-client-wmi-class.md) object that has the `LocalPackage` property set to `null`, the `SMS_InstalledExecutable` class inventories all executable files in the directory that are identified by the `InstallLocation` property. Executable files that are installed outside of the main installation directory are not inventoried.  

> [!NOTE]
>  This class does not inventory executable files located in the %*windir*% and %*systemroot*% directories.
