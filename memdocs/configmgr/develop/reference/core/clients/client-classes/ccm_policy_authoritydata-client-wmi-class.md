# CCM_Policy_AuthorityData Client WMI Class
In Configuration Manager, the `CCM_Policy_AuthorityData` class is a client Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) class that stores information about policy from a particular authority.  

 The following syntax is simplified from Managed Object Format (MOF) code and includes all inherited properties.  

## Syntax  

```  
Class CCM_Policy_AuthorityData : CCM_Policy_Config  
{  
      DateTime LastReplyTime;  
      String Name;  
      String ServerCookie;  
};  
```  

## Methods  
 The `CCM_Policy_AuthorityData` class does not define any methods.  

## Properties  
 `LastReplyTime`  
 Data type: `DateTime`  

 Access type: Read/Write  

 Qualifiers: None  

 The last date and time when the authority replied to a request for policy assignments. If this value is older than the value of `PolicyTimeUntilAck` in the authority's [CCM_PolicyAgent_Configuration Client WMI Class](../../../../../develop/reference/core/clients/client-classes/ccm_policyagent_configuration-client-wmi-class.md) object, the policy requests an acknowledgment. If the value is older than the value of `PolicyTimeUntilExpire`, the policy is expired.  

 `Name`  
 Data type: `String`  

 Access type: Read/Write  

 Qualifiers: [key]  

 Name of the authority to which the data applies.  

 `ServerCookie`  
 Data type: `String`  

 Access type: Read/Write  

 Qualifiers: None  

 The last `ServerCookie` value received from the authority in a `ReplyAssignments` message.
