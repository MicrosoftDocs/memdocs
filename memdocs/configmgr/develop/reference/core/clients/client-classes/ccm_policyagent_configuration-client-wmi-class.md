# CCM_PolicyAgent_Configuration Client WMI Class
In Configuration Manager, the `CCM_PolicyAgent_Configuration` class is a client Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) class that represents the Policy Agent configuration for a given authority.  

 The following syntax is simplified from Managed Object Format (MOF) code and includes all inherited properties.  

## Syntax  

```  
Class CCM_PolicyAgent_Configuration : CCM_Policy  
{  
      String AuthorityName;  
      Boolean PolicyDownloadByBatch;  
      String PolicyDownloadMethod;  
      UInt32 PolicyDownloadsPerBatch;  
      Boolean PolicyDownloadUsePeerCache;  
      Boolean PolicyEnableUserAuthForAllUserPolicies;  
      Boolean PolicyEnableUserGroupSupport; (Removed in SP1)  
      Boolean PolicyEnableUserPolicyOnInternet;  
      Boolean PolicyEnableUserPolicyPolling;  
      UInt32 PolicyExpirationTimeForDefaultPerUserRequestedConfig;  
      String PolicyID;  
      String PolicyInstanceID;  
      UInt32 PolicyPrecedence;  
      UInt32 PolicyRequestAssignmentTimeout;  
      String PolicyRuleID;  
      String PolicySource;  
      UInt32 PolicyTimeDelayBeforeUserPolicyRefreshAtLogonOrUnlock;  
      UInt32 PolicyTimeUntilAck;  
      UInt32 PolicyTimeUntilExpire;  
      UInt32 PolicyTimeUntilUpdateActualConfig;  
      String PolicyVersion;  
};  
```  

## Methods  
 The `CCM_PolicyAgent_Configuration` class does not define any methods.  

## Properties  
 `AuthorityName`  
 Data type: `String`  

 Access type: Read/Write  

 Qualifiers: [RealKey]  

 Name of the authority.  

 `PolicyDownloadsByBatch`  
 Data type: `Boolean`  

 Access type: Read/Write  

 Qualifiers: None

|||  
|-|-|  
|FILECOPY|Copy policy files using standard file copy operations. Policy paths must be local or Universal Naming Convention (UNC) file paths. This value is intended for testing only.|  
|HTTP|Download policy files synchronously by using direct HTTP. Policy paths must be HTTP URLs.|  
|BITS|Drizzle policy files asynchronously by using the Data Transfer Service. Policy paths must be HTTP URLs.|  

 `PolicyDownloadsPerBatch`  
 Data type: `UInt32`  

 Access type: Read/Write  

 Qualifiers: []  

 For batch policy download. The default value is 150.

 Data type: `Boolean`  

 Access type: Read/Write  

 Qualifiers: []  

 `true` to use peer cache.

 Data type: `Boolean`  

 Access type: Read/Write  

 Qualifiers: []  

 `true` to enable user policy polling.
