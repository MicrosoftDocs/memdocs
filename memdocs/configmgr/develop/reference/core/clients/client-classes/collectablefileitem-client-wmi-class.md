# CollectableFileItem Client WMI Class
In Configuration Manager, the **CollectableFileItem** class is a client Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) class that defines attributes of a file collection rule. The rule attributes define criteria, such as file name, directory paths, and file size limits. An example is `collect *.mif in %windir% up to 10 KB`.  

 The following syntax is simplified from Managed Object Format (MOF) code and includes all inherited properties.  

## Syntax  

```  
Class CollectableFileItem : SMS_FileCollectionAgent_Policy  
{  
      Boolean ExcludeCompressedEncrypted;  
      String FileCollectionActionID;  
      String FileItemID;  
      String FileSpec;  
      UInt32 MaxItemFileSize;  
      String PolicyID;  
      String PolicyInstanceID;  
      UInt32 PolicyPrecedence;  
      String PolicyRuleID;  
      String PolicySource;  
      String PolicyVersion;  
      Boolean ScanSubdirectories;  
      String SearchPath;  
      UInt32 Timeout;  
};  
```  

## Methods  
 The `CollectableFileItem` class does not define any methods.  

## Properties  
 `ExcludeCompressedEncrypted`  
 Data type: `Boolean`  

 Access type: Read/Write  

 Qualifiers: None  

 Flag indicating whether compressed or encrypted files and directories or both should be excluded from the scan. This property value is typically translated into the **FileSystemFile**, **IsCompressed**, and **IsEncrypted** property query value.  

 `FileCollectionActionID`  
 Data type: `String`  

 Access type: Read/Write  

 Qualifiers: None  

 ID that matches the **FileCollectionActionID** property for an associated [FileCollectionAction Client WMI Class](../../../../../develop/reference/core/clients/client-classes/filecollectionaction-client-wmi-class.md) object. The Inventory Agent uses this value to find the [CollectableFileItem Client WMI Class](../../../../../develop/reference/core/clients/client-classes/collectablefileitem-client-wmi-class.md) class for a particular file collection action.  

 `FileItemID`  
 Data type: `String`  

 Access type: Read/Write  

 Qualifiers: [realkey]  

 Unique ID for a **CollectableFileItem** object.  

 `FileSpec`  
 Data type: `String`  

 Access type: Read/Write  

 Qualifiers: None  

 File mask, including wildcards, used to specify file names that should be collected, for example, Virussig.dat, Boot*.ini, and \*.mif.  

 `MaxItemFileSize`  
 Data type: `UInt32`  

 Access type: Read/Write  

 Qualifiers: None  

 Total size, in bytes, allowed for files collected under this rule. For example, collect files up to a total of 128 KB for this rule.  

 `PolicyID`  
 Data type: `String`  

 Access type: Read/Write  

 Qualifiers: [key]  

 Unique ID of the policy.  

 `PolicyInstanceID`  
 Data type: `String`  

 Access type: Read/Write  

 Qualifiers: [key]  

 Unique ID of the policy instance.  

 `PolicyPrecedence`  
 Data type: `UInt32`  

 Access type: Read/Write  

 Qualifiers: None  

 Precedence for the policy.  

 `PolicyRuleID`  
 Data type: `String`  

 Access type: Read/Write  

 Qualifiers: [key]  

 Unique ID of the rule used to create the policy.  

 `PolicySource`  
 Data type: `String`  

 Access type: Read/Write  

 Qualifiers: [key]  

 Source of the policy.  

 `PolicyVersion`  
 Data type: `String`  

 Access type: Read/Write  

 Qualifiers: [key]  

 Version of the policy.  

 `ScanSubdirectories`  
 Data type: `Boolean`  

 Access type: Read/Write  

 Qualifiers: None  

 Flag indicating whether the file scan should scan subdirectories or only scan the root directory specified by **SearchPath**. This property value is used to format the **FileSystemFilePath** property query value, such as, c:\\\\* vs. c:\\\\.  

 `SearchPath`  
 Data type: `String`  

 Access type: Read/Write  

 Qualifiers: None  

 Root directory of the scan, for example, c:\\, %*windir*%, and d:\myapplication\\. This property is translated into the **FileSystemFilePath** property value.  

 `Timeout`  
 Data type: `UInt32`  

 Access type: Read/Write  

 Qualifiers: None  

 Timeout value, in milliseconds. If a **FileSystemFile** query initiated by the Inventory Agent during a file collection scan runs longer than the specified timeout value, the query is canceled. The default value is 7,200,000 milliseconds.  

## Remarks  
 The Inventory Agent uses each instance of this class to build a **FileSystemFile** query and collects the files matching the rule attributes. This class is similar to **InventoryDataItem**, although the properties are less directly translated into a WQL statement. However, the item properties are used to format the specific **FileSystemFile** query for the rule and are then used to identify files matching the attribute criteria. These matching files are then attached to the generated collected file report.  

 Each **CollectableFileItem** instance contains a reference to a **FileCollectionAction** instance; multiple **CollectableFileItem** rules are used to build the combined collected file report for a single **FileCollectionAction** instance.
