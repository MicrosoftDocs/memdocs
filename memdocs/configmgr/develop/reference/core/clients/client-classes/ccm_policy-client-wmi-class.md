# CCM_Policy Client WMI Class
In Configuration Manager, the `CCM_Policy` class is a client Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) class that represents a client policy.  

 The following syntax is simplified from Managed Object Format (MOF) code and includes all inherited properties.  

## Syntax  

```  
Class CCM_Policy  
{  
      String PolicyID;  
      String PolicyInstanceID;  
      UInt32 PolicyPrecedence;  
      String PolicyRuleID;  
      String PolicySource;  
      String PolicyVersion;  
};  
```  

## Methods  
 The `CCM_Policy` class does not define any methods.  

## Properties  
 `PolicyID`  
 Data type: `String`  

 Access type: Read/Write  

 Qualifiers: [key]  

 Unique ID of the policy.  

 `PolicyInstanceID`  
 Data type: `String`  

 Access type: Read/Write  

 Qualifiers: [key]  

 Unique ID of the policy instance.  

 `PolicyPrecedence`  
 Data type: `UInt32`  

 Access type: Read/Write  

 Qualifiers: [key]  

 Precedence is used to resolve conflicts between policies from the same policy authority. For example, this occurs in Configuration Manager when using collection variables to override site-wide policy, or setting a value for a collection variable on multiple collections of which the same client is a member.  

 `PolicyRuleID`  
 Data type: `String`  

 Access type: Read/Write  

 Qualifiers: [key]  

 Unique ID of the rule used to create the policy.  

 `PolicySource`  
 Data type: `String`  

 Access type: Read/Write  

 Qualifiers: [key]  

 Source of the policy.  

 `PolicyVersion`  
 Data type: `String`  

 Access type: Read/Write  

 Qualifiers: [key]  

 Version of the policy.
