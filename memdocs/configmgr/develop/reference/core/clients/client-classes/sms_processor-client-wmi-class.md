# SMS_Processor Client WMI Class
The `SMS_Processor` class is a client Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) class, in Configuration Manager, that represents a device that can interpret a sequence of instructions on a computer that is running a Windows operating system. On a multiprocessor computer, one `SMS_Processor` object exists for each processor.  

 The following syntax is simplified from Managed Object Format (MOF) code and includes all inherited properties.

 `Version`  
 Data type: `String`  

 Access type: Read-only  

 Qualifiers: None  

 Processor revision number that depends on the architecture.  

 `VoltageCaps`  
 Data type: `UInt32`  

 Access type: Read-only  

 Qualifiers: None  

 Voltage capabilities of the processor. Possible values are listed below. If the property is set to `null`, the voltage capabilities are unknown.  

|||  
|-|-|  
|1 (0x1)|5 volts|  
|2 (0x2)|3.3 volts|  
|4 (0x4)|2.9 volts|  

 Bits 0-3 of the property represent specific voltages that the processor socket can accept. All other bits should be set to 0 (zero). The socket is configurable if multiple bits are set. For more information about the actual voltage at which the processor is running, see the `CurrentVoltage` property.
