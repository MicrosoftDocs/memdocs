# SMS_ActiveSyncConnectedDevice Client WMI Class
The `SMS_ActiveSyncConnectedDevice` class is a client Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) class, in Configuration Manager, that represents a device connected to the ActiveSync service.  

 The following syntax is simplified from Managed Object Format (MOF) code and includes all inherited properties.  

## Syntax  

```  
Class SMS_ActiveSyncConnectedDevice : SMS_Class_Template  
{  
      String DeviceOEMInfo;  
      String DeviceType;  
      String InstalledClientID;  
      String InstalledClientServer;  
      String InstalledClientVersion;  
      String LastSyncTime;  
      String OS_AdditionalInfo;  
      String OS_Build;  
      String OS_Major;  
      String OS_Minor;  
      String OS_Platform;  
      String ProcessorArchitecture;  
      String ProcessorLevel;  
      String ProcessorRevision;  
};  
```
