# CCM_Policy_Assignment Client WMI Class
In Configuration Manager, the `CCM_Policy_Assignment` class is a client Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) class that represents a policy assignment.  

 The following syntax is simplified from Managed Object Format (MOF) code and includes all inherited properties.  

## Syntax  

```  
Class CCM_Policy_Assignment : CCM_Policy_Config  
{  
      String AssignmentCondition;  
      String AssignmentCookie;  
      String AssignmentID;  
      ref:CCM_Policy_Policy AssignmentPolicy;  
      String AssignmentSource;  
};  
```
