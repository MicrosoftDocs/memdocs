# SMS_SystemConsoleUsage Client WMI Class
The `SMS_SystemConsoleUsage` class is a client Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) class, in Configuration Manager, that defines usage data about devices, based on the Windows security event log.  

> [!NOTE]
>  For this class to gather usable data, the Auditing of Logon/Logoff policy must be turned on for each computer.  

 The following syntax is simplified from Managed Object Format (MOF) code and includes all inherited properties.  

## Syntax  

```  
Class SMS_SystemConsoleUsage   
{  
      DateTime SecurityLogStartDate;  
      String TopConsoleUser;  
      UInt32 TotalConsoleTime;  
      UInt32 TotalConsoleUsers;  
      UInt32 TotalSecurityLogTime;  
};  
```  

## Methods  
 The `SMS_SystemConsoleUsage` class does not define any methods.  

## Properties  
 `SecurityLogStartDate`  
 Data type: `DateTime`  

 Access type: Read-only  

 Qualifiers: [key]  

 The date and time of the oldest record in the system security event log.  

 `TopConsoleUser`  
 Data type: `String`  

 Access type: Read-only  

 Qualifiers: None  

 The user with the most console usage on the computer.  

 `TotalConsoleTime`  
 Data type: `UInt32`  

 Access type: Read-only  

 Qualifiers: None  

 The total number of console logon minutes recorded in the system security event log for all users.  

 `TotalConsoleUsers`  
 Data type: `UInt32`  

 Access type: Read-only  

 Qualifiers: None  

 The total number of unique console users recorded in the system security event log.  

 `TotalSecurityLogTime`  
 Data type: `UInt32`  

 Access type: Read-only  

 Qualifiers: None  

 The total time, in minutes, in the system security event log. This time is calculated by subtracting the timestamp for the oldest event in the log from the timestamp of the newest event.  

## Remarks  
 This class gathers information about all users from the system security event log by using logon and logoff events. When a logon event is found, the associated logon ID is used to search for a matching logoff event. If more than one logoff event is found for a specific logon event, then the last logoff event is used to calculate the amount of time that the user was logged on. This is because it is possible to issue more than one logoff request before the system actually performs the logoff action. If a matching logoff event cannot be found, the next shutdown event or logon event is used in place of a logoff event. If none of these can be found, the latest entry in the security log is used. The resulting information is aggregated by user and ordered by total console usage.  

> [!NOTE]
>  Only interactive logons are acknowledged by this class.  

 Some security logs can roll over frequently, or they can extend for several years. The time polled for this class is limited to the last 90 days.
