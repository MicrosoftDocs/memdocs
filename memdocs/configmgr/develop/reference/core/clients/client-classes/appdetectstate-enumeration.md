# AppDetectState Enumeration
In Configuration Manager, the `AppDetectState` enumeration defines application installation states. This enumeration is used by the [IAppManagementHandler Interface](../../../../../develop/reference/core/clients/client-classes/iappmanagementhandler-interface.md).  

## Syntax  

```  
typedef enum tagAppDetectState  
{  
    appDetectNotFound = 0,   
    appDetectInstalled,   
    appDetectFailed  
}AppDetectState;  

```  

## Elements  
 `appDetectNotFound`  
 The application was not found.  

 `appDetectInstalled`  
 The application is installed.  

 `appDetectFailed`  
 Application detection failed.  

## Remarks  
 This enumeration is used by the [IAppManagementHandler Interface](../../../../../develop/reference/core/clients/client-classes/iappmanagementhandler-interface.md).
