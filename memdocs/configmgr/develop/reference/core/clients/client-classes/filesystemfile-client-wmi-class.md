# FileSystemFile Client WMI Class
In Configuration Manager, the `FileSystemFile` class is a client Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) class that represents local file information.  

 The following syntax is simplified from Managed Object Format (MOF) code and includes all inherited properties.  

## Syntax  

```  
Class FileSystemFile  
{  
      String AgentCreatedWMIPath;  
      String CompanyName;  
      DateTime CreationDate;  
      DateTime FileBuildDate;  
      String FileDescription;  
      UInt32 FileFunctionType;  
      UInt32 FileGeneralType;  
      String FileInternalName;  
      String FileOriginalName;  
      UInt32 FileOSFlags;  
      String FileVersion;  
      UInt32 FileVersionFlags;  
      Boolean IsArchived;  
      Boolean IsCompressed;  
      Boolean IsEncrypted;  
      Boolean IsHidden;  
      Boolean IsNormal;  
      Boolean IsOffline;  
      Boolean IsReadOnly;  
      Boolean IsReparsePoint;  
      Boolean IsSparseFile;  
      Boolean IsSystem;  
      Boolean IsTemporary;  
      DateTime LastAccessDate;  
      DateTime LastWriteDate;  
      String Name;  
      String Path;  
      UInt32 ProductLanguage;  
      String ProductName;  
      String ProductVersion;  
      UInt32 ReservedFlags0;  
      UInt32 ReservedFlags1;  
      String ShortName;  
      UInt64 Size;  
      UInt32 Type;  
};  
```

 `IsArchived`  
 Data type: `Boolean`  

 Access type: Read/Write

 Access type: Read/Write  

 Qualifiers: None  

 `true` if the file is compressed.  

 `IsEncrypted`

 Qualifiers: [key]  

 Name of the file, with wildcards that are supported in the query (such as drv*.sys). This string is the long file name (if different from the 8.3 representation).  

 `Path`  
 Data type: `String`  

 Access type: Read/Write  

 Qualifiers: [key]  

 File path, not including the file name. The provider supports limited wildcards and directory vs. single directory scan syntax for querying based on this property. The provider also supports path queries with unexpanded environment variables, such as %*windir*%.

 Product version stored in the file resource header.  

 `ReservedFlags0`  
 Data type: `UInt32`  

 Access type: Read/Write  

 Qualifiers: None  

 Provided for completeness. For more information, see WIN32_FIND_DATA.  

 `ReservedFlags1`  
 Data type: `UInt32`  

 Access type: Read/Write  

 Qualifiers: None  

 Provided for completeness. For more information, see WIN32_FIND_DATA.  

 `ShortName`  
 Data type: `String`  

 Access type: Read/Write  

 Qualifiers: None  

 8.3 representation of the file name.  

 `Size`  
 Data type: `UInt64`  

 Access type: Read/Write  

 Qualifiers: [key]  

 File size, in bytes (a 64-bit value).  

 `Type`  
 Data type: `UInt32`  

 Access type: Read/Write  

 Qualifiers: None  

 File attribute bitmask, which matches the attribute bitmask returned by the Win32 `GetFileAttributes` function. The individual bits are also broken out into separate Boolean values for ease of querying and filtering.  

## Remarks  
 This class is used primarily for software inventory, file collection, and IDMIF collection.  

 To convert properties of this class to their WIN32_FIND_DATA equivalent, consult the WMI SDK.
