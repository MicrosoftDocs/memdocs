# CCM_Policy_Rule Client WMI Class
In Configuration Manager, the `CCM_Policy_Rule` class is a client Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) class that defines a policy object rule. Objects of this class are only used in the `PolicyRules` property in [CCM_Policy_Policy Client WMI Class](../../../../../develop/reference/core/clients/client-classes/ccm_policy_policy-client-wmi-class.md).  

 The following syntax is simplified from Managed Object Format (MOF) code and includes all inherited properties.  

## Syntax  

```  
Class  CCM_Policy_Rule : CCM_Policy_Config  
{  
      String RuleID;  
      String RuleCondition;  
      Object RuleActions[];  
};  
```  

## Properties  
 `RuleID`  
 Data type: `String`  

 Access type: Read-only  

 Qualifiers: [key]  

 Unique ID of the rule within the policy object.  

 `RuleCondition`  
 Data type: `String`  

 Access type: Read-only  

 Qualifiers: None  

 Optional. Rule condition. If the condition is not NULL, set this property to the unique ID of a [CCM_Policy_Condition Client WMI Class](../../../../../develop/reference/core/clients/client-classes/ccm_policy_condition-client-wmi-class.md) object. The rule is only applied if the policy is active and the rule condition evaluates to TRUE.  

 `RuleActions`  
 Data type: `Object` Array  

 Access type: Read-only  

 Qualifiers: None  

 Array of [CCM_Policy_Action Client WMI Class](../../../../../develop/reference/core/clients/client-classes/ccm_policy_action-client-wmi-class.md) objects specifying the actions to perform when the rule is applied.
