# CCM_Service_BITSConfiguration Client WMI Class
In Configuration Manager, the `CCM_Service_BITSConfiguration` class is a client Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) class that supports Background Intelligent Transfer Service (BITS)-related settings used by CCMEXEC for uploading and downloading message payloads. The following syntax is simplified from Managed Object Format (MOF) code and includes all inherited properties.  

## Syntax  

```  
Class CCM_Service_BITSConfiguration : CCM_Policy  
{  
      UInt8 DummyKey;  
      UInt32 MinimumRetryDelay;  
      UInt32 NoProgressTimeout;  
      String PolicyID;  
      String PolicyInstanceID;  
      UInt32 PolicyPrecedence;  
      String PolicyRuleID;  
      String PolicySource;  
      String PolicyVersion;  
};  
```  

## Methods  
 The `CCM_Service_BITSConfiguration` class does not define any methods.  

## Properties  
 `DummyKey`  
 Data type: `UInt8`  

 Access type: Read/Write  

 Qualifiers: None  

 This value is used as the WMI key for a singleton policy and has no other effect.  

 `MinimumRetryDelay`  
 Data type: `UInt32`  

 Access type: Read/Write  

 Qualifiers: None  

 Retry delay to pass to BITS when uploading or downloading message payloads (in minutes). If the value is 0 or `null`, BITS defaults are used.  

 `NoProgressTimeout`  
 Data type: `UInt32`  

 Access type: Read/Write  

 Qualifiers: None  

 No-progress timeout to pass to BITS when uploading or downloading message payloads (in minutes). If the value is `null` or 0, BITS defaults are used.  

 `PolicyID`  
 Data type: `String`  

 Access type: Read/Write  

 Qualifiers: [key]  

 See [CCM_Policy Client WMI Class](../../../../../develop/reference/core/clients/client-classes/ccm_policy-client-wmi-class.md).  

 `PolicyInstanceID`  
 Data type: `String`  

 Access type: Read/Write  

 Qualifiers: [key]  

 See [CCM_Policy Client WMI Class](../../../../../develop/reference/core/clients/client-classes/ccm_policy-client-wmi-class.md).  

 `PolicyPrecedence`  
 Data type: `UInt32`  

 Access type: Read/Write  

 Qualifiers: None  

 See [CCM_Policy Client WMI Class](../../../../../develop/reference/core/clients/client-classes/ccm_policy-client-wmi-class.md).  

 `PolicyRuleID`  
 Data type: `String`  

 Access type: Read/Write  

 Qualifiers: Key  

 See [CCM_Policy Client WMI Class](../../../../../develop/reference/core/clients/client-classes/ccm_policy-client-wmi-class.md).  

 `PolicySource`  
 Data type: `String`  

 Access type: Read/Write  

 Qualifiers: [key]  

 See [CCM_Policy Client WMI Class](../../../../../develop/reference/core/clients/client-classes/ccm_policy-client-wmi-class.md).  

 `PolicyVersion`  
 Data type: `String`  

 Access type: Read/Write  

 Qualifiers: [key]  

 See [CCM_Policy Client WMI Class](../../../../../develop/reference/core/clients/client-classes/ccm_policy-client-wmi-class.md).
