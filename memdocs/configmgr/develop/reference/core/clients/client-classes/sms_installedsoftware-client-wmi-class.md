# SMS_InstalledSoftware Client WMI Class
The `SMS_InstalledSoftware` class is a client Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) class, in Configuration Manager, that merges installed software information from multiple sources to provide categorization and Microsoft Licensing information.  

 The following syntax is simplified from Managed Object Format (MOF) code and includes all inherited properties.  

## Syntax  

```  
Class SMS_InstalledSoftware     
{    
      String ARPDisplayName;    
      String ChannelCode;    
      String CM_DSLID;    
      String EvidenceSource;   
      DateTime InstallDate;    
      UInt32 InstallDirectoryValidation;    
      String InstalledLocation;    
      String InstallSource;    
      UInt32 InstallType;   
      UInt32 Language;    
      String LocalPackage;    
      String ProductCode;    
      String ProductID;    
      String ProductName;    
      String ProductVersion;    
      String Publisher;    
      String RegisteredUser;    
      String ServicePack;    
      String SoftwareCode;    
      String SoftwarePropertiesHash;    
      String SoftwarePropertiesHashEx;    
      String UninstallString;    
      String UpgradeCode;    
      UInt32 VersionMajor;    
      UInt32 VersionMinor;    
};  
```

## Remarks  
 This class merges information from as many as five sources. The first source is the Windows `MsiEnumProducts` function. This function enumerates through all the products that are currently advertised or installed. Other sources of information for all installed software are the following registry keys:  

- HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Installer\UserData\\[User SID]\Products  

- HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall  

  The class also gathers information for operating system software from the following sources:  

- WMI class root\CIMV2:Win32_OperatingSystem  

- Registry key HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion
