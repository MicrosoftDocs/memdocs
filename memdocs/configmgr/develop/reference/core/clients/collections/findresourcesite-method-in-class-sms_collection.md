# FindResourceSite Method in Class SMS_Collection
The `FindResourceSite` Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) class method, in Configuration Manager, gets site code information for resources.  

 The following syntax is simplified from Managed Object Format (MOF) code and defines the method.  

## Syntax  

```  
sint32 FindResourceSite(  
        boolean IncludeSubCollections = false,   
        string SiteCode[],  
        uint32 ResourceNumber[]  
);  

```  

#### Parameters  
 `IncludeSubCollections`  
 Data type: `Boolean`  

 Qualifiers: [in, optional, deprecated]  

 true if subcollections are also marked for evaluation. If this parameter is set to false, subcollections are not included. The value defaults to false, if not specified.  

 `SiteCode[]`  
 Data type: `String` Array  

 Qualifiers: [out]  

 Site code of the site with which the resource is associated.  

 `ResourceNumber`  
 Data type: `UInt32` Array  

 Qualifiers: [out]  

 Configuration Manager supplied ID that uniquely identifies a client resource.  

## Return Values  
 An  `SInt32` data type that is 0 to indicate success or non-zero to indicate failure.
