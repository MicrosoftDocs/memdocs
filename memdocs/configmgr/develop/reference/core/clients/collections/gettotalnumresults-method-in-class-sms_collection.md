     ref:SMS_Collection Collection,  
     UInt32 Result  
);  
```  

#### Parameters

 Data type: `ref:SMS_Collection`

 Collection ID or object path of the collection. The collection ID is the value of the `CollectionID` property of [SMS_Collection Server WMI Class](../../../../../develop/reference/core/clients/collections/sms_collection-server-wmi-class.md).  

 `Result`  
 Data type: `UInt32`  

 Qualifiers: [out]  

 Number of collection members, including subcollections.  

## Return Values  
 An  `SInt32` data type that is 0 to indicate success or non-zero to indicate failure.
