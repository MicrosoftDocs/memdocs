# SMS_CombinedUserResources Server WMI Class
The `SMS_ CombinedUserResources` Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) class is an SMS Provider server class, in Configuration Manager, represents all the user resources in the system.  

 The following syntax is simplified from Managed Object Format (MOF) code and includes all inherited properties.  

## Syntax  

```  
Class SMS_ CombinedUserResources: SMS_BaseClass  
{  
      String Domain;  
      String Name;  
      UInt32 ResourceID;  
      UInt32 ResourceType;  
      String SMSID;  
};  
```  

## Methods  
 The `SMS_ CombinedUserResources` class does not define any methods.  

## Properties

 Name of the resource.  

 `ResourceID`  
 Data type: `UInt32`

 `SMSID`  
 Data type: `String`  

 Access type: Read Only  

 Qualifiers: None

## Remarks  
 Similar to the members class that is generated for querying "All Systems," this class is designed for summarizing the major properties across different feature areas and is not bound by the same RBAC rules as the "All Systems" resource class.  

 Class qualifiers for this class include:  

- Abstract
