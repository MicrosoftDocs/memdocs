# VerifyNoCircularDependencies Method in Class SMS_Collection
In Configuration Manager, the `VerifyNoCircularDependencies` Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) class method takes two collections as arguments and verifies that no circular dependencies would be formed if one collection were the parent of another.  

 The following syntax is simplified from Managed Object Format (MOF) code and is intended to show the definition of the method.  

## Syntax  

```  
sint32 VerifyNoCircularDependencies(  
        SMS_Collection ref parentCollection,   
        SMS_Collection ref subCollection,   
        boolean Result);  

```  

#### Parameters  
 `parentCollection`  
 Data type: `ref:SMS_Collection`  

 Qualifiers: [in]  

 Reference to an [SMS_Collection Server WMI Class](../../../../../develop/reference/core/clients/collections/sms_collection-server-wmi-class.md) object path for the parent collection.  

 `subCollection`  
 Data type: `ref:SMS_Collection`  

 Qualifiers: [in]  

 Reference to an [SMS_Collection Server WMI Class](../../../../../develop/reference/core/clients/collections/sms_collection-server-wmi-class.md) object path for the child collection.  

 `Result`  
 Data type: `Boolean`  

 Qualifiers: [out]  

 true if there are no circular dependencies, false if there are circular dependencies.  

## Return Values  
 An  `SInt32` data type that is 0 to indicate success or non-zero to indicate failure.
