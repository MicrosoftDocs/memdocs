# SMS_CombinedResources Server WMI Class
The `SMS_CombinedResources` Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) class is an SMS Provider server class, in Configuration Manager, represents all the device and user resources in the system.  

 The following syntax is simplified from Managed Object Format (MOF) code and includes all inherited properties.  

## Syntax  

```  
Class SMS_ CombinedResources: SMS_BaseClass  
{  
      String Domain;  
      String Name;  
      UInt32 ResourceID;  
      UInt32 ResourceType;  
      String SMSID;  
};  
```  

## Methods  
 The `SMS_ CombinedResources` class does not define any methods.

 Class qualifiers for this class include:  

- Abstract
