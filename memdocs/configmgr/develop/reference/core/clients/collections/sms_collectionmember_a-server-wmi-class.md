# SMS_CollectionMember_a Server WMI Class
The `SMS_CollectionMember_a` association Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) class is an SMS Provider server class, in Configuration Manager, that relates an [SMS_Collection Server WMI Class](../../../../../develop/reference/core/clients/collections/sms_collection-server-wmi-class.md) object with [SMS_Resource Server WMI Class](../../../../../develop/reference/core/clients/manage/sms_resource-server-wmi-class.md) objects that represent the member resources of the collection.  

 The following syntax is simplified from Managed Object Format (MOF) code and includes all inherited properties.  

## Syntax  

```  
Class SMS_CollectionMember_a : SMS_BaseAssociation  
{  
      UInt32 ClientCertType;  
      UInt32 ClientType;  
      ref:SMS_Collection collection;  
      String CollectionID;  
      UInt32 DeviceOwner;  
      String Domain;  
      Boolean IsActive;  
      Boolean IsAlwaysInternet;  
      UInt32 IsApproved;  
      Boolean IsAssigned;  
      Boolean IsBlocked;  
      Boolean IsClient;  
      Boolean IsDecommissioned;  
      Boolean IsDirect;  
      Boolean IsInternetEnabled;  
      Boolean IsObsolete;  
      String Name;  
      ref:SMS_Resource resource;  
      UInt32 ResourceID;  
      UInt32 ResourceType;  
      String SiteCode;  
      String SMSID;  
      Boolean IsVirtualMachine;  
};  
```

## Remarks  
 Class qualifiers for this class include:  

- Association: ToInstance  

- Read (read-only)  

  For more information about both the class qualifiers and the property qualifiers included in the Properties section, see [Configuration Manager Class and Property Qualifiers](../../../../../develop/reference/misc/class-and-property-qualifiers.md).  

  The `CollectionID` and `ResourceID` properties can be used in a WMI Query Language (WQL) WHERE clause. However, you are limited to using an OR condition. Your query might not use the other properties in the relationship.
