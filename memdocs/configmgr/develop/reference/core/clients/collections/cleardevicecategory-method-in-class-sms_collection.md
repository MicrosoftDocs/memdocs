# ClearDeviceCategory Method in Class SMS_Collection
The `ClearDeviceCatetory` Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) class method, in Configuration Manager, clears a category from a set of devices.  

 The following syntax is simplified from Managed Object Format (MOF) code and defines the method.  

## Syntax  

```  
SInt32 ClearDeviceCategory (  
    UInt32 ResourceIDs[]  
);  

```  

#### Parameters  
 `ResourceIDs`  
 Data type: `UInt32 Array`  

 Qualifiers: [in]  

 An array of resource IDs. The items in the array represent the devices from which to clear a category.  

## Return Values  
 An `SInt32` data type that is 0 to indicate success or non-zero to indicate failure.
