# ChangeOwnership Method in Class SMS_Collection
The `ChangeOwnership` Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) class method, in Configuration Manager, changes ownership of the devices.  

 The following syntax is simplified from Managed Object Format (MOF) code and defines the method.  

## Syntax  

```  
SInt32 ChangeOwnership(  
     UInt32 ResourceIDs[],  
     UInt32 DeviceOwner  
     SInt32 ReturnValue  
);  
```  

#### Parameters  
 `ResourceIDs`  
 Data type: `UInt32` Array  

 Qualifiers: [in]  

 IDs of member resources.  

 `DeviceOwner`  
 Data type: `UInt32`  

 Qualifiers: [in]  

 The new owner of the machines.  

|||

 `ReturnValue`  
 Data type: `SInt32`  

 Qualifiers: [out]  

 The number of devices that were successfully reassigned ownership.  

> [!IMPORTANT]

## Return Values  
 An `SInt32` data type that is 0 to indicate success or non-zero to indicate failure.
