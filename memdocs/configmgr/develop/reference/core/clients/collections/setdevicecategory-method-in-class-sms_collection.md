# SetDeviceCategory Method in Class SMS_Collection
The `SetDeviceCategory` Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) class method, in Configuration Manager, assigns a category to a set of devices.  

 The following syntax is simplified from Managed Object Format (MOF) code and defines the method.  

## Syntax  

```  
SInt32 SetDeviceCategory (  
    String CategoryID,   
    UInt32 ResourceIDs[]  
);  

```  

#### Parameters  
 `CategoryID`  
 Data type: `String`  

 Qualifiers: [in]  

 A device category ID. This value is a GUID in string format.  

 `ResourceIDs`  
 Data type: `UInt32 Array`  

 Qualifiers: [in]  

 An array of resource IDs. The items in the array represent the devices to which the category is to be assigned.  

## Return Values  
 An `SInt32` data type that is 0 to indicate success or non-zero to indicate failure.
