# GetNumResults Method in Class SMS_Collection
The `GetNumResults` Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) class method, in Configuration Manager, gets a count of all members in a collection, not including subcollections.  

 The following syntax is simplified from Managed Object Format (MOF) code and defines the method.  

## Syntax  

```  
SInt32 GetNumResults(  
     ref:SMS_Collection Collection,  
     UInt32 Result  
);  
```  

#### Parameters  
 `Collection`  
 Data type: `ref:SMS_Collection`  

 Qualifiers: [in]  

 Collection ID or object path of the collection. The collection ID is the value of the `CollectionID` property of [SMS_Collection Server WMI Class](../../../../../develop/reference/core/clients/collections/sms_collection-server-wmi-class.md).  

 `Result`  
 Data type: `UInt32`  

 Qualifiers: [out]  

 Number of collection members.  

## Return Values  
 An  `SInt32` data type that is 0 to indicate success or non-zero to indicate failure.
