# SMS_CM_RES_COLL_CollectionID Server WMI Class
The `SMS_CM_RES_COLL_CollectionID` Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) class is an SMS Provider server class, in Configuration Manager, that represents a particular member of an [SMS_Collection Server WMI Class](../../../../../develop/reference/core/clients/collections/sms_collection-server-wmi-class.md) object by collection ID.  

 The following syntax is simplified from Managed Object Format (MOF) code and includes all inherited properties.  

## Syntax  

```  
Class SMS_CM_RES_COLL_CollectionID : SMS_CollectionMember  
{  
      UInt32 ClientType;  
      String Domain;  
      Boolean IsActive;  
      Boolean IsAlwaysInternet;  
      UInt32 IsApproved;  
      Boolean IsAssigned;  
      Boolean IsBlocked;  
      Boolean IsClient;  
      Boolean IsDecommissioned;  
      Boolean IsDirect;  
      Boolean IsInternetEnabled;  
      Boolean IsObsolete;  
      String Name;  
      UInt32 ResourceID;  
      UInt32 ResourceType;  
      String SiteCode;  
      String SMSID;  
};  
```

## Remarks  
 The `CollectionID` property of a collection is the unique collection identifier assigned when the collection is created. The SMS Provider creates several default `SMS_CM_RES_COLL_``CollectionID` classes at installation time for collection IDs with values beginning with "SMS". For example, SMS_CM_RES_COLL_`SMS00004` identifies all Windows NT Workstation systems.  

 This class is deleted automatically if the associated collection is deleted.
