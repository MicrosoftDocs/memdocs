# AddMembershipRule Method in Class SMS_Collection
The `AddMembershipRule` Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) class method, in Configuration Manager, adds a new rule to the `CollectionRules` property of the [SMS_Collection Server WMI Class](../../../../../develop/reference/core/clients/collections/sms_collection-server-wmi-class.md).  

 The following syntax is simplified from Managed Object Format (MOF) code and defines the method.  

## Syntax  

```  
SInt32 AddMembershipRule(  
     SMS_CollectionRule collectionRule,  
     UInt32 QueryID  
);  
```  

#### Parameters  
 `collectionRule`  
 Data type: `SMS_CollectionRule`  

 Qualifiers: [in]  

 [SMS_CollectionRule Server WMI Class](../../../../../develop/reference/core/clients/collections/sms_collectionrule-server-wmi-class.md) object to add.  

 `QueryID`  
 Data type: `UInt32`  

 Qualifiers: `[out]`  

 Configuration Manager-generated query ID if the rule is a query rule. If the rule is direct, this ID is 0. Use `QueryID` to modify or delete a query membership rule.  

## Return Values  
 An  `SInt32` data type that is 0 to indicate success or non-zero to indicate failure.
