# SMS_CollectionRuleQuery Server WMI Class
The `SMS_CollectionRuleQuery` Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) class is an SMS Provider server class, in Configuration Manager, that represents a member of a collection based on the results of a query.  

 The following syntax is simplified from Managed Object Format (MOF) code and includes all inherited properties.  

## Syntax  

```  
Class SMS_CollectionRuleQuery : SMS_CollectionRule  
{  
      String QueryExpression;  
      UInt32 QueryID;  
      String RuleName;  
};  
```  

## Methods  
 The following table lists the methods in the `SMS_CollectionRuleQuery` class.

 Data type: `String`
