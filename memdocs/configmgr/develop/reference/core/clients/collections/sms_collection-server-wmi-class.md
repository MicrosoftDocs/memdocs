# SMS_Collection Server WMI Class
The `SMS_Collection` Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) class is an SMS Provider server class in Configuration Manager. It represents a collection of resources related logically by rules along with collection information.  

 The following syntax is simplified from Managed Object Format (MOF) code and includes all inherited properties.  

## Syntax  

```  
Class SMS_Collection : SMS_BaseClass   
{   
   String CollectionID;   
   SMS_CollectionRule CollectionRules[];   
   UInt32 CollectionType;   
   SInt32 CollectionVariablesCount;   
   String Comment;   
   UInt32 CurrentStatus;  
   Boolean HasProvisionedMember;   
   SInt32 IncludeExcludeCollectionsCount;   
   Boolean IsBuiltIn;   
   Boolean IsReferenceCollection;  
   UInt8 ISVData[];   
   UInt32 ISVDataSize;   
   String ISVString;  
   DateTime LastChangeTime;   
   DateTime LastMemberChangeTime;   
   DateTime LastRefreshTime;   
   String LimitToCollectionID;   
   String LimitToCollectionName;   
   SInt32 LocalMemberCount;   
   String MemberClassName;   
   SInt32 MemberCount;   
   UInt32 MonitoringFlags;   
   String Name;   
   Boolean OwnedByThisSite;   
   SInt32 PowerConfigsCount;   
   SMS_ScheduleToken RefreshSchedule[];   
   UInt32 RefreshType;   
   Boolean ReplicateToSubSites;   
   SInt32 ServiceWindowsCount;   
   Boolean UseCluster;  
};  
```

The collection membership is only updated if your application specifies a schedule or calls the [RequestRefresh Method in Class SMS_Collection](../../../../../develop/reference/core/clients/collections/requestrefresh-method-in-class-sms_collection.md) method. For the collection evaluator to use the schedule, the `RefreshType` property must be set to PERIODIC.

## Remarks  
 Class qualifiers for this class include:  

- Secured  

  For more information about both the class qualifiers and the property qualifiers included in the Properties section, see [Configuration Manager Class and Property Qualifiers](../../../../../develop/reference/misc/class-and-property-qualifiers.md).  

  Collection information represented by this class includes the refresh schedule and the members, represented by [SMS_CM_RES_COLL_CollectionID Server WMI Class](../../../../../develop/reference/core/clients/collections/sms_cm_res_coll_collectionid-server-wmi-class.md) objects. Your application can use a collection to target resources for software distribution.  

  When you run a query against a dynamic collection represented by `SMS_Collection`, ensure that the SMS Provider is loaded or that another method or query has already run.  

  The application should use the `SMS_Collection` methods to add, update, or delete membership rules defined by the `CollectionRules` property. This property is not retrieved when your application enumerates `SMS_Collection`. To obtain the collection rules for a collection, your application must use `IWbemServices::GetObject` or `SWbemServices::Get`. For more information, see Configuration Manager Context Qualifiers.
