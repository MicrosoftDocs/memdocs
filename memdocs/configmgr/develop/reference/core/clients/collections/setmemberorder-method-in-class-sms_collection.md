# SetMemberOrder Method in Class SMS_Collection
The `SetMemberOrder` Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) class method, in Configuration Manager, sets the order of the members of a collection. Use this class instance when the members of a  server group collection need to be patched in a particular order.  

 The following syntax is simplified from Managed Object Format (MOF) code and defines the method.  

## Syntax  

```  
SInt32 SetMemberOrder (  
    String CollectionID,   
    String ResourceIDs  
);  

```  

#### Parameters  
 `CollectionID`  
 Data type: `String`  

 Qualifiers: [in]  

 The ID of a collection.  

 `ResourceIDs`  
 Data type: `String`  

 Qualifiers: [in]  

 A string of resource IDs.  

## Return Values  
 An `SInt32` data type that is 0 to indicate success or non-zero to indicate failure.
