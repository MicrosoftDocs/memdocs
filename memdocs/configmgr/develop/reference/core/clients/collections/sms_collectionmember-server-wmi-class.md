# SMS_CollectionMember Server WMI Class
The `SMS_CollectionMember` Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) class is an SMS Provider server class, in Configuration Manager, that serves as the abstract base class for the member classes for each collection. [SMS_CM_RES_COLL_CollectionID Server WMI Class](../../../../../develop/reference/core/clients/collections/sms_cm_res_coll_collectionid-server-wmi-class.md) derives from `SMS_CollectionMember` class.  

 The following syntax is simplified from Managed Object Format (MOF) code and includes all inherited properties.  

## Syntax  

```  
Class SMS_CollectionMember : SMS_BaseClass  
{  
      String Domain;  
      Boolean IsAssigned;  
      Boolean IsClient;  
      Boolean IsDirect;  
      String Name;  
      UInt32 ResourceID;  
      UInt32 ResourceType;  
      String SiteCode;  
      String SMSID;  
};  
```  

## Methods  
 The `SMS_CollectionMember` class does not define any methods.
