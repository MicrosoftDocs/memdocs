# CreateRelationship Method in Class SMS_UserMachineRelationship
The `CreateRelationship` Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) class method, in Configuration Manager, creates a relationship between a user and a device.  

 The following syntax is simplified from Managed Object Format (MOF) code and defines the method.  

## Syntax  

```  
sint32 CreateRelationship (  
     uint32 MachineResourceId,  
     string UserAccountName,  
     uint32 SourceId,  
     uint32 TypeId  
);  
```  

#### Parameters  
 `MachineResourceId`  
 Data type: `UInt32`  

 Qualifiers: `[in]`  

 Unique Configuration Manager-supplied identifier for the resource.  

 `UserAccountName`  
 Data type: `String`  

 Qualifiers: `[in]`  

 User account name.  

 `SourceId`  
 Data type: `UInt32`  

 Qualifiers: `[in]`  

 Source object identifier for dependency.  

|||

|Software Catalog|The end user enabled the relationship by selecting the option in the AppCatalog Web page.|  
|Administrator|An administrator created the relationship manually in the UI.|  
|User|Unused/deprecated.|  
|Usage Agent|The threshold of activity triggered a relationship to be created.|  
|Device Management|The user/device were tied together during enrollment.|

|Fast Install|The user/device were tied together temporarily to enable an on-demand install from the catalog if no UDA relationship installed before the Install was triggered.|

 `TypeId`  
 Data type: `UInt32`  

 Qualifiers: `[in, optional]`  

 Type identifier.
