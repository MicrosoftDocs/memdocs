# SMS_Resource Server WMI Class
The `SMS_Resource` Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) class is an SMS Provider server class, in Configuration Manager, that serves as an abstract base class for all discovery resource classes, for example, [SMS_R_IPNetwork Server WMI Class](../../../../../develop/reference/core/clients/manage/sms_r_ipnetwork-server-wmi-class.md).  

 The following syntax is simplified from Managed Object Format (MOF) code and includes all inherited properties.

```  
Class SMS_Resource : SMS_BaseClass  
{  
     UInt32 ResourceID;  
};  
```

## Properties  
 `ResourceID`  
 Data type: **UInt32**  

 Access type: Read/Write  

 Qualifiers: [key]  

 Configuration Manager-supplied ID that uniquely identifies a Configuration Manager client resource. This ID is not unique across sites. The default value is ''".  

## Remarks

- Abstract  

- Read:ToSubClass  

  For more information about both the class qualifiers and the property qualifiers included in the Properties section, see [Configuration Manager Class and Property Qualifiers](../../../../../develop/reference/misc/class-and-property-qualifiers.md).
