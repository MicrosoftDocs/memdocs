 Value identifying the state of the record. Although it is usually set to 0, this value is set to 1 when the server detects that the record has been superseded by another record for the same computer.

## Remarks  
 You cannot create or update resource instances by using WMI, but you must create or update resources by using data discovery records. However, you can delete resource instances by using WMI.
