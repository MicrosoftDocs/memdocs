# Refresh Method in Class SMS_ResourceMap
The `Refresh` Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) class method, in Configuration Manager, updates resource (classes derived from [SMS_R_System Server WMI Class](../../../../../develop/reference/core/clients/manage/sms_r_system-server-wmi-class.md)) and inventory (classes derived from [SMS_G_System_Current Server WMI Class](../../../../../develop/reference/core/clients/manage/sms_g_system_current-server-wmi-class.md)) class definitions.  

 The following syntax is simplified from Manage Object Format (MOF) code and defines the method.

```  

#### Parameters

## Return Values  
 An `SInt32` data type that is 0 to indicate success or non-zero to indicate failure.
