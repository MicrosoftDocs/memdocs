# SMS_PendingRegistrationRecord Server WMI Class
The `SMS_PendingRegistrationRecord` Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) class is an SMS Provider server class, in Configuration Manager, that describes hardware conflicts between two computers.  

 The following syntax is simplified from Managed Object Format (MOF) code and includes all inherited properties.  

## Syntax  

```  
Class SMS_PendingRegistrationRecord   
{   
      string AgentName;   
      string Certificate;   
      string ClientVersion;   
      string ConflictSMSID;   
      string FQDN;   
      string HardwareID;   
      boolean IsAlwaysInternet;   
      boolean IsIntegratedAuth;   
      boolean IsInternetEnabled;   
      string IssuedTo;   
      sint32 KeyType;   
      string NetBiosName;   
      string PublicKey;   
      string SiteCode;   
      string SMSID;   
      string Thumbprint;   
      datetime ValidFrom;   
      datetime ValidUntil;   
};  
```
