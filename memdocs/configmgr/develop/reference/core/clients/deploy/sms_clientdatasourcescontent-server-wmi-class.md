# SMS_ClientDataSourcesContent Server WMI Class
The `SMS_ClientDataSourcesContent` Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) class is an SMS Provider server class, in Configuration Manager, that represents client content data sources per boundary group.  

 The following syntax is simplified from Managed Object Format (MOF) code and includes all inherited properties.  

## Syntax  

```  
Class SMS_ClientDataSourcesContent : SMS_BaseClass  
{  
    UInt64 BranchCacheBytes;  
    UInt64 CloudDistributionPointBytes;  
    UInt64 DistributionPointBytes;  
    UInt32 DpSourceServerCount;  
    UInt64 PeerCacheBytes;  
    UInt32 SpSourceClientCount;  
};  

```

 The `SMS_ClientDataSourcesContent` class does not define any methods.
