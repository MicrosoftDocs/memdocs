# GetLockInformation Method in Class SMS_ObjectLock
The `GetLockInformation` Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) class method, in Configuration Manager,  gets current lock information.  

 The following syntax is simplified from Managed Object Format (MOF) code and defines the method.  

## Syntax  

```  
SInt32 GetLockInformation(  
    string ObjectRelPath,   
    uint32 LockState,   
    string AssignedUser,   
    string AssignedObjectLockContext,   
    string AssignedMachine,   
    string AssignedSiteCode,   
    datetime AssignedTimeUTC  
);  
```
