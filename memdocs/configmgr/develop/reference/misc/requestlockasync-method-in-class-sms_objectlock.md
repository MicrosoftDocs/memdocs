# RequestLockAsync Method in Class SMS_ObjectLock
The `RequestLockAsync` Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) class method, in Configuration Manager, asynchronously acquires a lock to edit global objects.  

 The following syntax is simplified from Managed Object Format (MOF) code and defines the method.  

## Syntax  

```  
SInt32 RequestLockAsync(  
    string ObjectRelPath,   
    boolean RequestTransfer,   
    string RequestID   
);  
```  

#### Parameters  
 `ObjectRelPath`  
 Data type: `String`  

 Qualifiers: [in]  

 The path of the object for which the lock is requested.  

 `RequestTransfer`  
 Data type: `Boolean`  

 Qualifiers: [in, optional]  

 If the lock is not owned by the local site, the lock request should be forwarded to the parent/child site.  

 `RequestID`  
 Data type: `String`  

 Qualifiers: [out]  

 Unique identifier of the request.  

## Return Values  
 An `SInt32` data type that is 0 to indicate success or non-zero to indicate failure.
