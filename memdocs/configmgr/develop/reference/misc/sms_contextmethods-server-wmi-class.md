```

|[GetContextHandle Method in Class SMS_ContextMethods](../../../develop/reference/misc/getcontexthandle-method-in-class-sms_contextmethods.md)|Caches multiple context qualifiers within the SMS Provider. This allows applications to use a much smaller context object when making API calls to WMI.|
