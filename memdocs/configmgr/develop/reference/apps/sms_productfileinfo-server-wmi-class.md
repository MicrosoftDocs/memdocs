# SMS_ProductFileInfo Server WMI Class
The `SMS_ProductFileInfo` Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) class is an SMS Provider server class, in Configuration Manager, that represents a combination of file and product information for inventory and metering.  

 The following syntax is simplified from Managed Object Format (MOF) code and includes all inherited properties.  

## Syntax  

```  
Class SMS_ProductFileInfo : SMS_BaseClass  
{  
      String CompanyName;  
      String FileDescription;  
      SInt64 FileID;  
      String FileName;  
      UInt32 FileSize;  
      String FileVersion;  
      UInt32 ProductLanguage;  
      String ProductName;  
      String ProductVersion;  
};  
```

 The `SMS_ProductFileInfo` class does not define any methods.

## Remarks  
 There are no special class qualifiers for this class. For more information about both the class qualifiers and the property qualifiers included in the Properties section, see [Configuration Manager Class and Property Qualifiers](../../../develop/reference/misc/class-and-property-qualifiers.md).  

 This class provides the source for the `FileID` foreign key property in other classes. When a file is metered, information about the file is sent with the process execution information. This is a subset of the information that is reported by software inventory. The common information that is shared between software inventory and software metering is represented by this class, which lists every file known to the operating system.
