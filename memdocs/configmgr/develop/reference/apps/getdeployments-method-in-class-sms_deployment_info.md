# GetDeployments Method in Class SMS_Deployment_Info
The `GetDeployments` Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) class method, in Configuration Manager, gets advertisement identifier or Assignment identifier and related type for a deployment that is deployed to the specified resource.  

 The following syntax is simplified from Managed Object Format (MOF) code and defines the method.  

## Syntax  

```  
sint32 GetDeployments(  
     uint32 ResourceID,  
     string DeploymentIDs[],  
     uint32 DeploymentTypeID[]  
);  
```  

#### Parameters  
 `ResourceID`  
 Data type: `UInt32`  

 Qualifiers: [in]  

 Configuration Manager supplied ID for the resource. This ID is not unique across sites.  

 `DeploymentIDs`  
 Data type: `String` Array  

 Qualifiers: [out]  

 Unique auto-generated key for the deployment.  

 `DeploymentTypeID`  
 Data type: `UInt32` Array  

 Qualifiers: [out]  

 Type identifier of the deployment.  

## Return Values  
 An  `SInt32` data type that is 0 to indicate success or non-zero to indicate failure.
