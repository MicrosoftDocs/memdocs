# SMS_AmPolicySummary Server WMI Class
The `SMS_AmPolicySummary` Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) class is an SMS Provider server class, in Configuration Manager, that represents the endpoint protection client antimalware policy status.

 The following syntax is simplified from Managed Object Format (MOF) code and includes all inherited properties.  

## Syntax  

```  
Class SMS_AmPolicySummary : SMS_BaseClass  
{  
    UInt32 AppliedCount;  
    DateTime AssignmentTime;  
    UInt32 ClientSettingsID;  
    String CollectionID;  
    String CollectionName;  
    UInt32 FailureCount;  
    UInt32 ID;  
    DateTime LastClientUpdateTime;  
    UInt32 NotAppliedCount;  
    UInt32 TotalCount;  
    UInt32 UnknownCount;  
};  
```
