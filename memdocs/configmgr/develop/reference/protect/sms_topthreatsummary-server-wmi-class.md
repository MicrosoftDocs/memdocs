# SMS_TopThreatSummary Server WMI Class
The `SMS_TopThreatSummary` Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) class is an SMS Provider server class, in Configuration Manager, that summarizes the top threats per collection.  

 The following syntax is simplified from Managed Object Format (MOF) code and includes all inherited properties.  

## Syntax  

```  
Class SMS_TopThreatSummary : SMS_BaseClass  
{  
    String CollectionID;  
    UInt32 CollectionMembers;  
    String CollectionName;  
    UInt32 FailedCount;  
    DateTime FirstDetectionTime;  
    UInt32 InfectedCount;  
    Boolean IsAllowed;  
    Boolean IsExcluded;  
    Boolean IsRestored;  
    DateTime LastDetectionTime;  
    DateTime LastUpdateTime;  
    UInt32 PendingCount;  
    UInt32 RemediatedCount;  
    UInt32 Severity;  
    UInt32 ThreatCategoryID;  
    UInt64 ThreatID;  
    String ThreatName;  
};  
```
