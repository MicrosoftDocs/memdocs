Class SMS_ClientOperationStatus : SMS_BaseClass  
{  
    String CollectionID;  
    UInt32 CompletedClients;  
    String CreatedBy;  
    UInt32 FailedClients;  
    UInt32 ID;  
    UInt32 IsExpired;  
    DateTime LastSummaryTime;  
    UInt32 OfflineClients;  
    String PrimaryActionTargetObjectID;  
    String PrimaryActionTargetObjectName;  
    UInt32 PrimaryActionTargetObjectType;  
    UInt32 PrimaryActionType;  
    UInt32 Priority;  
    DateTime RequestedTime;  
    UInt32 State;  
    String TargetCollectionName;  
    DateTime TimeLastUpdated;
