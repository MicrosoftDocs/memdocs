# SMS_G_System_EndpointProtectionStatus Server WMI Class
The `SMS_G_System_EndpointProtectionStatus` Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) class is an SMS Provider server class, in Configuration Manager, that represents status of Endpoint Protection.  

 The following syntax is simplified from Managed Object Format (MOF) code and includes all inherited properties.  

## Syntax  

```  
Class SMS_G_System_EndpointProtectionStatus : SMS_G_System  
{  
    Boolean AmFullscanRequired;  
    Boolean AmManualStepsRequired;  
    Boolean AmOfflineScanRequired;  
    Boolean AmRecentlyCleaned;  
    Boolean AmRemediationFailed;  
    Boolean AmRestartRequired;  
    Boolean AmThreatActivity;  
    Boolean AtRisk;  
    Boolean EnforcementFailed;  
    Boolean EnforcementSucceeded;  
    Boolean Inactive;  
    Boolean InstallFailed;  
    Boolean NoSignature;  
    Boolean NotClient;  
    Boolean NotYetInstalled;  
    Boolean PendingReboot;  
    Boolean Protected;  
    UInt32 ResourceID;  
    Boolean SignatureOlderThan7Days;  
    Boolean SignatureUpTo1DayOld;  
    Boolean SignatureUpTo3DaysOld;  
    Boolean SignatureUpTo7DaysOld;  
    Boolean Unhealthy;  
    Boolean Unsupported;  
};  
```  

## Methods  
 The `SMS_G_System_EndpointProtectionStatus` class does not define any methods.  

## Properties  
 `AmFullscanRequired`  
 Data type: `Boolean`

 `Protected`  
 Data type: `Boolean`  

 Access type: Read/Write  

 Qualifiers: none  

 `true` if the client is well protected.  

 `ResourceID`  
 Data type: `UInt32`

 Qualifiers: [key]  

 Client resource identifier.  

 `SignatureOlderThan7Days`  
 Data type: `Boolean`
