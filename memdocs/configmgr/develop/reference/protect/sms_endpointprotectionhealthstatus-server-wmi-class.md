# SMS_EndpointProtectionHealthStatus Server WMI Class
The `SMS_EndpointProtectionHealthStatus` Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) class is an SMS Provider server class, in Configuration Manager, that represents health status of Endpoint Protection.   

 The following syntax is simplified from Managed Object Format (MOF) code and includes all inherited properties.  

## Syntax  

```  
Class SMS_EndpointProtectionHealthStatus : SMS_BaseClass  
{  
    UInt32 ApplyPolicyFailedCount;  
    UInt32 ApplyPolicySucceededCount;  
    String CollectionID;  
    UInt32 InstallFailedCount;  
    UInt32 InstallRebootPendingCount;  
    UInt32 NoSignatureCount;  
    UInt32 OverallNotClientCount;  
    UInt32 OverallStatusAtRiskCount;  
    UInt32 OverallStatusInactiveCount;  
    UInt32 OverallStatusNotSupportedCount;  
    UInt32 OverallStatusNotYetInstalledCount;  
    UInt32 OverallStatusProtectedCount;  
    UInt32 SignaturesOlderThan7DaysCount;  
    UInt32 SignaturesUpTo1DayOldCount;  
    UInt32 SignaturesUpTo3DaysOldCount;  
    UInt32 SignaturesUpTo7DaysOldCount;  
    DateTime TimeLastUpdated;  
    UInt32 TotalMemberCount;  
    UInt32 TotalOperationalIssueCount;  
    UInt32 UnhealthyCount;  
};  
```
