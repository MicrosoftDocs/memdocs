# GetEncryptDecryptKey Method in Class SMS_StateMigration
The `GetEncryptDecryptKey` Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) class method, in Configuration Manager, retrieves the symmetric key that is used to encrypt and decrypt the user state during state migration.  

 The following syntax is simplified from Managed Object Format (MOF) code and defines the method.  

## Syntax  

```  
SInt32 GetEncryptDecryptKey(  
   String Key  
);  
```  

#### Parameters  
 `Key`  
 Data type: `String`  

 Qualifiers: [out]  

 The encryption key required to restore user state.  

## Return Values  
 An `SInt32` data type that is 0 to indicate success or non-zero to indicate failure.  

 For information about handling returned errors, see [About Configuration Manager Errors](../../../develop/core/understand/about-configuration-manager-errors.md).
