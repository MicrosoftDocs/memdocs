# SMS_TaskSequence_ApplyNetworkSettingsAction Server WMI Class
The `SMS_TaskSequence_ApplyNetworkSettingsAction` Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) class is an SMS Provider server class, in Configuration Manager, that represents a task sequence action that specifies the network or workgroup configuration information for the target computer.  

 The following syntax is simplified from Managed Object Format (MOF) code and includes all inherited properties.  

## Syntax  

```  
Class SMS_TaskSequence_ApplyNetworkSettingsAction : SMS_TaskSequence_Action  
{  
      SMS_TaskSequence_NetworkAdapterSettings Adapters[];  
      SMS_TaskSequence_Condition Condition;  
      Boolean ContinueOnError;  
      String Description;  
      String DNSDomain;  
      String DNSSuffixSearchOrder[];  
      String DomainName;  
      String DomainOUName;  
      String DomainPassword;  
      String DomainUsername;  
      Boolean Enabled;  
      Boolean EnableTCPIPFiltering;  
      String Name;  
      UInt32 NetworkJoinType;  
      UInt32 NumAdapters;  
      String SupportedEnvironment;  
      UInt32 Timeout;  
      String WorkgroupName;  
};  
```  

## Methods  
 The `SMS_TaskSequence_ApplyNetworkSettingsAction` class does not define any methods.

 `DNSDomain`  
 Data type: `String`  

 Access type: Read/Write  

 Qualifiers: [Global]  

 The primary Domain Name System (DNS) domain. This property must be global so that it is visible in finalize mode.  

 `DNSSuffixSearchOrder`  
 Data type: `String` Array  

 Access type: Read/Write  

 Qualifiers: [Global]  

 The DNS suffix search order. This property must be global so that it is visible in finalize mode.  

 `DomainName`  
 Data type: `String`  

 Access type: Read/Write  

 Qualifiers: [RequiredIfNull("WorkgroupName"), AllowedLen("1-255")]  

 Name of the domain for the target computer. The name can be between 1 and 255 characters in length. Supply this name if `NetworkJoinType` is set to 0.  

 `DomainOUName`  
 Data type: `String`  

 Access type: Read/Write  

 Qualifiers: [AllowedLen("0-32767")]  

 The name of the Active Directory organizational unit (OU) to which the user belongs. The name can be between 0 and 32,767 characters in length. Set this property if `NetworkJoinType` is set to 0.  

 `DomainPassword`  
 Data type: `String`  

 Access type: Read/Write  

 Qualifiers: [VariableName("OSDJoinPassword"), Secret]  

 Password of the account used when the user joins a Windows domain. Set this property if `NetworkJoinType` is set to 0.  

 The task sequence variable associated with this property is OSDJoinPassword. For more information, see [OS deployment task sequence variables](../../../osd/understand/task-sequence-variables.md#OSDJoinPassword).  

 `DomainUsername`  
 Data type: `String`
