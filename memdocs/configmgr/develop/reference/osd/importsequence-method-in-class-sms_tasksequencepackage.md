# ImportSequence Method in Class SMS_TaskSequencePackage
The `ImportSequence` Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) class method, in Configuration Manager, imports a task sequence package file based on the provided XML data of a previously exported task sequence package.  

 The following syntax is simplified from Managed Object Format (MOF) code and defines the method.  

## Syntax  

```  
SInt32 ImportSequence(  
      String SequenceXML,  
      SMS_TaskSequence TaskSequence  
);  
```  

#### Parameters  
 `SequenceXML`  
 Data type: `String`  

 Qualifiers: [in]  

 A `string` variable which contains the XML data of the task sequence package to import.  

 `TaskSequence`  
 Data type: `SMS_TaskSequence`  

 Qualifiers: [out]  

 The produced `SMS_TaskSequence` object.  

## Return Values  
 An `SInt32` data type that is 0 to indicate success or non-zero to indicate failure.
