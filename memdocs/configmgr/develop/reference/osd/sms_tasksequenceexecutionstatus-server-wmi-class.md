```  
Class SMS_TaskSequenceExecutionStatus : SMS_BaseClass  
{  
    String ActionName;  
    String ActionOutput;  
    String AdvertisementID;  
    DateTime ExecutionTime;  
    UInt32 ExitCode;  
    String GroupName;  
    UInt32 LastStatusMsgID;  
    String LastStatusMsgName;  
    String PackageID;  
    UInt32 ResourceID;  
    UInt32 Step;  
};
