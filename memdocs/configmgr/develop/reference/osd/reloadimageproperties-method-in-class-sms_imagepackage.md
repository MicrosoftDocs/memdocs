# ReloadImageProperties Method in Class SMS_ImagePackage
The `ReloadImageProperties` Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) class method, in Configuration Manager, reloads image metadata from an image source .wim file and synchronizes the metadata with the database.  

 The following syntax is simplified from Managed Object Format (MOF) code and defines the method.  

## Syntax  

```  
SInt32 ReloadImageProperties();  
```  

#### Parameters  
 None.  

## Return Values  
 An `SInt32` data type that is 0 to indicate success or non-zero to indicate failure.  

 For information about handling returned errors, see [About Configuration Manager Errors](../../../develop/core/understand/about-configuration-manager-errors.md).  

## Remarks  
 For an example of the use of this method, see [How to Update an Operating System Image Package in Configuration Manager](../../../develop/osd/how-to-update-an-operating-system-image-package.md).
