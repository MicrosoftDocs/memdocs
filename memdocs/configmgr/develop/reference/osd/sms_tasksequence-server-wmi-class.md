# SMS_TaskSequence Server WMI Class
The `SMS_TaskSequence` Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) class is an SMS Provider server class, in Configuration Manager, that represents an operating system deployment task sequence.  

 The following syntax is simplified from Managed Object Format (MOF) code and includes all inherited properties.  

## Syntax  

```  
Class SMS_TaskSequence  
{  
      String SchemaVersion;  
      SMS_TaskSequence_Step Steps[];  
};  
```  

## Methods  
 The following table shows the methods in `SMS_TaskSequence`.  

|Method|Description|  
|------------|-----------------|  
|[ExportXml Method in Class SMS_TaskSequence](../../../develop/reference/osd/exportxml-method-in-class-sms_tasksequence.md)|Exports task sequence XML in a format that is suitable to use on another site.|  
|[LoadFromXml Method in Class SMS_TaskSequence](../../../develop/reference/osd/loadfromxml-method-in-class-sms_tasksequence.md)|Loads a task sequence into WMI objects from XML.|  
|[SaveToXml Method in Class SMS_TaskSequence](../../../develop/reference/osd/savetoxml-method-in-class-sms_tasksequence.md)|Serializes a task sequence from WMI objects to XML.|  

## Properties  
 `SchemaVersion`  
 Data type: `String`  

 Access type: Read/Write  

 Qualifiers: None  

 The version of the task sequence schema. The default version number is 3.00.  

 Although this property is designated as read/write in WMI, your application should not change it. The schema version must match the version that is detected by the client, or the client does not run the task sequence.  

 `Steps`  
 Data type: `SMS_TaskSequence_Step` Array  

 Access type: Read/Write  

 Qualifiers: None  

 [SMS_TaskSequence_Step Server WMI Class](../../../develop/reference/osd/sms_tasksequence_step-server-wmi-class.md) objects representing steps and conditions in the task sequence.  

## Remarks  
 Class qualifiers for this class include:  

- Dynamic  

- Provider("TaskSequenceProvider")  

  For more information about both the class qualifiers and the property qualifiers included in the Properties section, see [Configuration Manager Class and Property Qualifiers](../../../develop/reference/misc/class-and-property-qualifiers.md).  

  A task sequence is a series of steps and conditions that are processed during operating system deployment.  

  A step in the task sequence is usually an action, represented by the [SMS_TaskSequence_Action Server WMI Class](../../../develop/reference/osd/sms_tasksequence_action-server-wmi-class.md) or a derived class. A task sequence step can also be a set of actions in a group, represented by [SMS_TaskSequence_Group Server WMI Class](../../../develop/reference/osd/sms_tasksequence_group-server-wmi-class.md). For more information, see [SMS_TaskSequence_Step Server WMI Class](../../../develop/reference/osd/sms_tasksequence_step-server-wmi-class.md).  

  Task sequence steps are managed using WMI. The sequence steps are processed in order and can have conditions associated with them that determine how the action, or group of actions, is processed. For more information, see Operating System Deployment Task Sequence Object Model.  

  Your application uses `SMS_TaskSequence` objects through a [SMS_TaskSequencePackage Server WMI Class](../../../develop/reference/osd/sms_tasksequencepackage-server-wmi-class.md) object, which supports a `Sequence` property to wrap the task sequence in the database. The application sets up a new task sequence by calling the [SetSequence Method in Class SMS_TaskSequencePackage](../../../develop/reference/osd/setsequence-method-in-class-sms_tasksequencepackage.md) and accesses an existing task sequence using the [GetSequence Method in Class SMS_TaskSequencePackage](../../../develop/reference/osd/getsequence-method-in-class-sms_tasksequencepackage.md). For more information about working with a task sequence, see How to Create an Operating System Deployment Task Sequence and How to Create an Operating System Deployment Task Sequence Package.
