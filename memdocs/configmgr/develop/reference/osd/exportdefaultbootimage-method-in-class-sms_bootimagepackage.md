# ExportDefaultBootImage Method in Class SMS_BootImagePackage
The `ExportDefaultBootImage` Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) class method, in Configuration Manager, finalizes a boot image and then exports the image from the specified source to the specified location.  

 The following syntax is simplified from Managed Object Format (MOF) code and defines the method.  

## Syntax  

```  
SInt32 ExportDefaultBootImage(  
     String Architecture,  
     UInt32 ImageIndex,  
     String ExportImagePath  
);  
```  

#### Parameters  
 `Architecture`  
 Data type: `String`  

 Qualifiers: [in]  

 Operating system architecture of the boot image. Possible values are:  

|||  
|-|-|  
|x86|I386 32-bit microprocessor|  
|ia64|Itanium 64-bit microprocessor|  
|x64|X86-64 64-bit microprocessor|  

 `ImageIndex`  
 Data type: `UInt32`  

 Qualifiers: [in]  

 The index of the boot image in the Windows Assessment and Deployment Kit source that is used by Configuration Manager setup.  

 `ExportImagePath`  
 Data type: `String`  

 Qualifiers: [in]  

 The destination path of the boot image to export, for example, c:\winPE\boot.wim.  

## Return Values  
 An `SInt32` data type that is 0 to indicate success or non-zero to indicate failure.  

 For information about handling returned errors, see [About Configuration Manager Errors](../../../develop/core/understand/about-configuration-manager-errors.md).  

## Remarks  

> [!NOTE]
>  Because Configuration Manager uses this method in importing the operating system, be sure to use secure programming techniques in your application or script.  

 The `ExportDefaultBootImage` method is not thread-safe.  

 This method finalizes a boot image by adding components or deleting old components to reduce the image size. Each .wim file can contain multiple images, but the export occurs only for the boot image.
