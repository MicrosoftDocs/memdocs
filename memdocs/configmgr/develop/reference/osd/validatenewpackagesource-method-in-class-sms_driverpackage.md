# ValidateNewPackageSource Method in Class SMS_DriverPackage
The `ValidateNewPackageSource` Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) class method, in Configuration Manager, validates a new location for a driver update.  

 The following syntax is simplified from Managed Object Format (MOF) code and defines the method.  

## Syntax  

```  
SInt32 ValidateNewPackageSource(  
     String PackageSource  
);  
```  

#### Parameters  
 `PackageSource`  
 Data type: `String`  

 Qualifiers: [in]  

 The driver package content to verify.  

## Return Values  
 An `SInt32` data type that is 0 to indicate success or non-zero to indicate failure.  

 For information about handling returned errors, see [About Configuration Manager Errors](../../../develop/core/understand/about-configuration-manager-errors.md).  

## Remarks  
 This method is new in the latest version of Configuration Manager. Note that it is the only way to change the package source for an [SMS_Driver Server WMI Class](../../../develop/reference/osd/sms_driver-server-wmi-class.md) object. Most other types of packages can be changed in the console, but not the driver package. The access to this package from the console is restricted.  

 To use this method:  

1.  Manually copy the package files from the old source location to the new location.  

2.  In your application, obtain an [SMS_DriverPackage Server WMI Class](../../../develop/reference/osd/sms_driverpackage-server-wmi-class.md) object for the driver.  

3.  Include a call to `ValidateNewPackageSource` on the package.  

4.  On successful return from the method, have the application change the `StoredPkgPath` property in the package to indicate the new source location.
