# Query2
`Query2` specifies a query, in Configuration Manager, that is used to identify the platform that a client computer is running.

 The query is run on the client computer and typically inspects Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) to determine the client platform. For example, `SELECT * FROM Win32_Processor WHERE Architecture=9 AND DataWidth=64`.  

 **Type**: Element.
