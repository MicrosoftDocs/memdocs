# SMS_TaskSequence_PartitionSettings Server WMI Class
The `SMS_TaskSequence_PartitionSettings` Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) class is an SMS Provider server class, in Configuration Manager, that specifies the settings to use when creating and formatting a partition on a hard disk drive.  

 The following syntax is simplified from Managed Object Format (MOF) code and includes all inherited properties.  

## Syntax  

```  
Class SMS_TaskSequence_PartitionSettings  
{  
      Boolean AssignVolumeLetter;  
      Boolean Bootable;  
      String FileSystem;  
      Boolean QuickFormat;  
      UInt32 Size;  
      String SizeUnits;  
      String Type;  
      String VolumeLetterVariable;  
      String VolumeName;  
};  
```  

## Methods  
 The `SMS_TaskSequence_PartitionSettings` class does not define any methods.  

## Properties  
 `AssignVolumeLetter`  
 Data type: `Boolean`  

 Access type: Read/Write  

 Qualifiers: None  

 `true` if a volume letter will be assigned to the partition. The default value is `true`.  

 This information applies to System Center 2012 Configuration Manager SP1 or later, and System Center 2012 R2 Configuration Manager or later.  

 `Bootable`  
 Data type: `Boolean`  

 Access type: Read/Write  

 Qualifiers: [not_null]  

 `true` to set the partition as the active partition. The default value is `false`.  

 `FileSystem`  
 Data type: `String`  

 Access type: Read/Write  

 Qualifiers: None  

 File system to use when formatting the partition. Possible values are:  

- FAT32  

- NTFS  

  `QuickFormat`  
  Data type: `Boolean`  

  Access type: Read/Write  

  Qualifiers: [not_null]  

  `true` to perform a quick format. Set this property to `false` to perform a full format.  

  `Size`  
  Data type: `UInt32`  

  Access type: Read/Write  

  Qualifiers: None  

  Size of the partition to create. The units are defined by the `SizeUnits` property.  

  `SizeUnits`  
  Data type: `String`  

  Access type: Read/Write  

  Qualifiers: None  

  Units in which the `Size` property is specified. Possible values are:  

| Value | Size units |  
| ----- | ---------- |  
|MB|Megabytes|  
|GB|Gigabytes|  
|Percent|Percentage of free space remaining on disk|  

 `Type`  
 Data type: `String`

 Qualifiers: [not_null]  

 Type of partition to create. Possible values are:  

- Primary  

- Extended  

- Logical  

- Hidden  

- EFI  

- MSR  

  `VolumeLetterVariable`  
  Data type: `String`  

  Access type: Read/Write  

  Qualifiers: None  

  Name of a task sequence variable that receives the drive letter of the newly created partition.  

  `VolumeName`
