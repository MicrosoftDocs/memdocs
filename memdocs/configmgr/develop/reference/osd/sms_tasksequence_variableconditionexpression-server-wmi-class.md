# SMS_TaskSequence_VariableConditionExpression Server WMI Class
The `SMS_TaskSequence_VariableConditionExpression` Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) class is an SMS Provider server class, in Configuration Manager, that represents a condition expression to check for the existence of a variable and, optionally, compare the variable to a specific value.  

 The following syntax is simplified from Managed Object Format (MOF) code and includes all inherited properties.  

## Syntax  

```  
Class SMS_TaskSequence_VariableConditionExpression : SMS_TaskSequence_ConditionExpression  
{  
      String Operator;  
      String Value;  
      String Variable;  
};  
```  

## Methods  
 The `SMS_TaskSequence_VariableConditionExpression` class does not define any methods.  

## Properties  
 `Operator`  
 Data type: `String`  

 Access type: Read/Write  

 Qualifiers: [Not_Null]  

 Operator to use in the verification. Possible values are:  

- exists  

- notExists  

- equals  

- notEquals  

- less  

- lessEqual  

- greater  

- greaterEqual  

  `Value`  
  Data type: `String`  

  Access type: Read/Write  

  Qualifiers: None  

  Optional value to which the variable can be compared.  

  `Variable`  
  Data type: `String`  

  Access type: Read/Write  

  Qualifiers: [Not_Null]  

  The name of the variable to verify.  

## Remarks  
 There are no class qualifiers for this class. For more information about both the class qualifiers and the property qualifiers included in the Properties section, see [Configuration Manager Class and Property Qualifiers](../../../develop/reference/misc/class-and-property-qualifiers.md).  

 This condition expression is used to test the value of a task sequence variable. For example, to perform a step only if the task sequence is not running under Windows PE, you would set the following:  

 `Variable` - _SMSTSInWinPE.  

 `Operator` - equals  

 `Value` - false  

 For more information about task sequence variables, see [Operating System Deployment Task Sequence Variables](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=100711).
