# SMS_TaskSequence_RegistryConditionExpression Server WMI Class
The `SMS_TaskSequence_RegistryConditionExpression` Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) class is an SMS Provider server class, in Configuration Manager, that represents a condition expression to check for the existence of a registry key and, optionally, compare it to specified data.  

 The following syntax is simplified from Managed Object Format (MOF) code and includes all inherited properties.  

## Syntax  

```  
Class SMS_TaskSequence_RegistryConditionExpression : SMS_TaskSequence_ConditionExpression  
{  
      String Data;  
      String KeyPath;  
      String Operator;  
      String Type;  
      String Value;  
};  
```  

## Methods  
 The `SMS_TaskSequence_RegistryConditionExpression` class does not define any methods.  

## Properties  
 `Data`  
 Data type: `String`  

 Access type: Read/Write  

 Qualifiers: None  

 User-specified data to compare to the registry key information.  

 `KeyPath`  
 Data type: `String`  

 Access type: Read/Write  

 Qualifiers: [Not_Null]  

 Path for the registry key.  

 `Operator`  
 Data type: `String`  

 Access type: Read/Write  

 Qualifiers: [Not_Null]  

 The condition operator to use in the comparison. Possible values are:  

- exists  

- nonExists  

- equals  

- notEquals  

- less  

- lessEqual  

- greater  

- greaterEqual  

  `Type`  
  Data type: `String`  

  Access type: Read/Write  

  Qualifiers: None  

  Registry key type. Possible values are:  

- REG_BINARY  

- REG_DWORD  

- REG_EXPAND_SZ  

- REG_MULTI_SZ  

- REG_NONE  

- REG_QWORD  

- REG_SZ  

  `Value`  
  Data type: `String`  

  Access type: Read/Write  

  Qualifiers: [AllowedLen("0-250")]  

  Value of the registry key. The value length can be between 0 and 250 characters.  

## Remarks  
 There are no class qualifiers for this class. For more information about both the class qualifiers and the property qualifiers included in the Properties section, see [Configuration Manager Class and Property Qualifiers](../../../develop/reference/misc/class-and-property-qualifiers.md).  

 You use `SMS_TaskSequence_RegistryConditionExpression` to check for the existence of a registry key, or alternatively to check for a registry key value. For example, if you have the registry key "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\Select" and the DWORD value set to 'Current' under it, then, `KeyPath` would be "HKEY...\Select", `Operator` would be 'Equals' (or 'NotEquals', and so on), `Type` would be REG_DWORD, `Value` would be 'Select', and `Data` would be the numeric value to compare against the value of the registry key ('Select').  

 `Type` applies only when checking for the existence of a registry value specified in `Value`; when comparing values, `Type` is not used. This means that if 'Exists' is the `Operator` and REG_SZ is the `Type`, the result will evaluate to `False` because 'Select' is a REG_DWORD.  

 However, when comparing values ('Equals', 'Greater', and so on), then `Type` is not used. Instead the value of `Data` is compared against `Value` regardless of the actual registry type and `Type`.
