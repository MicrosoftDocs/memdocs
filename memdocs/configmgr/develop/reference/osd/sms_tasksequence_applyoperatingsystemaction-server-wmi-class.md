# SMS_TaskSequence_ApplyOperatingSystemAction Server WMI Class
The `SMS_TaskSequence_ApplyOperatingSystemAction` Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) class is an SMS Provider server class, in Configuration Manager, that represents a task sequence action that installs a specified operating system image on a target computer.  

 The following syntax is simplified from Managed Object Format (MOF) code and includes all inherited properties.  

## Syntax  

```  
Class SMS_TaskSequence_ApplyOperatingSystemAction : SMS_TaskSequence_Action  
{  
      SMS_TaskSequence_Condition Condition;  
      String ConfigFileName;  
      String ConfigFilePackage;  
      Boolean ContinueOnError;  
      String Description;  
      UInt32 DestinationDisk;  
      String DestinationLogicalDrive;  
      UInt32 DestinationPartition;  
      String DestinationVariable;  
      Boolean Enabled;  
      UInt32 ImageIndex;  
      String ImagePackageID;  
      UInt32 InstallEditionIndex;  
      String InstallPackageID;  
      String Name;  
      Boolean RunFromNet;  
      String SupportedEnvironment;  
      UInt32 Timeout;  
};  
```

## Remarks  
 Class qualifiers for this class include:  

 [CommandLine("OSDApplyOS.exe\<?1: /image:%1,%%OSDImageIndex%%>\<?3: /install:%3,%%OSDInstallEditionIndex%%>\<?4: \\"/config:%4,%%OSDConfigFileName%%\\">\<?6: /target:%6,%7>\<?8: /target:%8>\<?9: /target:%%%9%%>"),  

 ActionCategory{"Images,1,5"},ActionUI{"AdminUI.TaskSequenceEditor.dll", "Microsoft.ConfigurationManagement.AdminConsole.TaskSequenceEditor", "ApplyOperatingSystemControl","TaskSequenceOptionControl"},SequenceCategory("OSD")]  

 For more information about both the class qualifiers and the property qualifiers included in the Properties section, see [Configuration Manager Class and Property Qualifiers](../../../develop/reference/misc/class-and-property-qualifiers.md).  

 The following properties can be set for the target of this task sequence action:  

- `DestinationDisk`  

- `DestinationPartition`  

- `DestinationLogicalDrive`  

- `DestinationVariable`  

  To install to a specific disk or partition, set `DestinationDisk` and `DestinationPartition` and set the other destination properties to `null`.  

  To install to a logical volume, such as c:\\, set `DestinationLogicalDrive` and set the other properties to `null`.  

  `DestinationVariable` can be set to a task sequence variable that contains the destination in the form of "1,1" to target disk 1, partition 1, or contains "c:" to target a logical volume.  

  Set all the destination properties to `null`, to use the "next available" formatted volume as the target.  

  The following properties are specific to a particular type of installation:  

- The `ImagePackageID` and `ImageIndex` properties are used for an image-based installation.  

- The `InstallPackageID` and `InstallEditionIndex` properties are used for a scripted installation.  

- The `ConfigFilePackage` and `ConfigFileName` properties are used for installation from a configuration file.  

  The `InstallEditionIndex` property is set by the `SMS_TaskSequence_ApplyOperatingSystemAction` class. It is retrieved by [SMS_TaskSequence_SetupWindowsAndSMSAction Server WMI Class](../../../develop/reference/osd/sms_tasksequence_setupwindowsandsmsaction-server-wmi-class.md).  

> [!NOTE]
>  The value supplied for the `ImageIndex` property can be problematic if your application has to range-check the property against a maximum value that is greater than 0x7fffffff (2147483647). In this case, your application cannot use the range qualifier on the property.
