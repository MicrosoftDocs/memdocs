# SMS_TaskSequence_OfflineEnableBitLockerAction
The `SMS_TaskSequence_OfflineEnableBitLockerAction` Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) class is an SMS Provider server class, in Configuration Manager, that represents a task sequence action that pre-provisions BitLocker for the operating system drive.  

 The following syntax is simplified from Managed Object Format (MOF) code and includes all inherited properties.  

## Syntax  

```  
Class SMS_TaskSequence_OfflineEnableBitLockerAction : SMS_TaskSequence_Action  
{  
    Object Condition;  
    Boolean ContinueOnError;  
    String Description;  
    UInt32 DestinationDisk;  
    String DestinationLogicalDrive;  
    UInt32 DestinationPartition;  
    String DestinationVariable;  
    Boolean Enabled;  
    String Name;  
    Boolean SkipWhenTPMInvalid;  
    String SupportedEnvironment;  
    UInt32 Timeout;  
};  
```  

## Methods  
 The `SMS_TaskSequence_OfflineEnableBitLockerAction` class does not define any methods.  

## Properties  
 `Condition`

 `DestinationDisk`  
 Data type: `UInt32`  

 Access type: Read/Write  

 Qualifiers: [commandlinearg(1), valuerange("0-99")]  

 Index of the disk for which to pre-provision BitLocker. The index can have a value of 1 through 99.  

 `DestinationLogicalDrive`  
 Data type: `String`  

 Access type: Read/Write  

 Qualifiers: [commandlinearg(3), valuemap {"C:","D:","E:","F:","G:","H:","I:","J:","K:","L:","M:","N:","O:","P:","Q:","R:","S:","T:","U:","V:","W:","X:","Y:","Z:"}]  

 Logical drive letter of the volume to which to provision BitLocker. Possible values are A-Z.  

 `DestinationPartition`  
 Data type: `UInt32`  

 Access type: Read/Write  

 Qualifiers: [commandlinearg(2), requiredifnotnull("DesinationDisk"), valuerange("1-99")]  

 Index of the partition on the target disk specified by `DestinationDisk` to which to pre-provision BitLocker. The index can have a value of 1 through 99.  

 `DestinationVariable`  
 Data type: `String`  

 Access type: Read/Write  

 Qualifiers: [commandlinearg]  

 Task sequence variable containing the logical drive letter of the volume to which to pre-provision BitLocker.  

 `Enabled`  
 Data type: `Boolean`  

 Access type: Read/Write  

 Qualifiers: none  

 See [SMS_TaskSequence_Action Server WMI Class](../../../develop/reference/osd/sms_tasksequence_action-server-wmi-class.md).  

 `Name`  
 Data type: `String`  

 Access type: Read/Write

 Qualifiers: [not_null, valuemap]  

 See [SMS_TaskSequence_Action Server WMI Class](../../../develop/reference/osd/sms_tasksequence_action-server-wmi-class.md). The default value of this property for this task sequence action is WinPE.  

 `Timeout`  
 Data type: `UInt32`  

 Access type: Read/Write  

 Qualifiers: none  

 See [SMS_TaskSequence_Action Server WMI Class](../../../develop/reference/osd/sms_tasksequence_action-server-wmi-class.md).
