# SMS_CollectionVariable Server WMI Class
The `SMS_CollectionVariable` Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) class is an SMS Provider server class, in Configuration Manager, that represents a collection variable that is accessible at the time of task execution.  

 The following syntax is simplified from Managed Object Format (MOF) code and includes all inherited properties.  

## Syntax  

```  
Class SMS_CollectionVariable  
{  
      Boolean IsMasked;  
      String Name;  
      String Value;  
};  
```  

## Methods  
 The `SMS_CollectionVariable` class does not define any methods.  

## Properties  
 `IsMasked`  
 Data type: `Boolean`  

 Access type: Read/Write  

 Qualifiers: None  

 This value should be set to `true` if the collection variable contains a sensitive value such as a password. If the value is set to `true`, the SMS Provider treats this property as write-only and disallows reads. The default value is `false`.  

 `Name`  
 Data type: `String`  

 Access type: Read/Write  

 Qualifiers: [key]  

 Collection variable name. The default value is "".  

 `Value`  
 Data type: `String`  

 Access type: Read/Write  

 Qualifiers: None  

 Collection variable value. The default value is "".  

## Remarks  
 Class qualifiers for this class include:  

- Embedded  

  For more information about both the class qualifiers and the property qualifiers included in the Properties section, see [Configuration Manager Class and Property Qualifiers](../../../develop/reference/misc/class-and-property-qualifiers.md).  

  Collection variables are associated with collections as collection extended properties.
