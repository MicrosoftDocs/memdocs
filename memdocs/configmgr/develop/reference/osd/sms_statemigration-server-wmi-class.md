# SMS_StateMigration Server WMI Class
The `SMS_StateMigration` Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) class is an SMS Provider server class, in Configuration Manager, that contains all the state migration information for a specific computer association and exposes methods for managing an association.  

 The following syntax is simplified from Managed Object Format (MOF) code and includes all inherited properties.  

## Syntax  

```  
Class SMS_StateMigration : SMS_BaseClass  
{  
   UInt32 MigrationBehavior;  
   String MigrationID;  
   UInt32 MigrationStatus;  
   UInt32 MigrationType;  
   UInt32 RestoreClientResourceID;  
   String RestoreLastLogonUserDomain;  
   String RestoreLastLogonUserName;  
   String RestoreMACAddresses;  
   String RestoreName;  
   String SiteCode;  
   UInt32 SourceClientResourceID;  
   String SourceLastLogonUserDomain;  
   String SourceLastLogonUserName;  
   String SourceMACAddresses;  
   String SourceName;  
   DateTime StoreCreationDate;  
   DateTime StoreDeletionDate;  
   String StorePath;  
   DateTime StoreReleaseDate;  
   SMS_StateMigrationUserNames UserNames[];  
};  
```  

## Methods  
 The following table shows the methods in `SMS_StateMigration`.  

|Method|Description|  
|------------|-----------------|  
|[AddAssociation Method in Class SMS_StateMigration](../../../develop/reference/osd/addassociation-method-in-class-sms_statemigration.md)|Adds the association between two system resources.|  
|[DeleteAssociation Method in Class SMS_StateMigration](../../../develop/reference/osd/deleteassociation-method-in-class-sms_statemigration.md)|Deletes the association between two system resources.|  
|[GetEncryptDecryptKey Method in Class SMS_StateMigration](../../../develop/reference/osd/getencryptdecryptkey-method-in-class-sms_statemigration.md)|Retrieves the symmetric key that is used to encrypt and decrypt the user state.|  
|[AddAssociationEx Method in Class SMS_StateMigration](../../../develop/reference/osd/addassociationex-method-in-class-sms_statemigration.md)|Adds the association with a specified migration behavior between two system resources.|

## Remarks  
 Class qualifiers for this class include:  

- Secured  

  For more information about both the class qualifiers and the property qualifiers that are included in the Properties section, see [Configuration Manager Class and Property Qualifiers](../../../develop/reference/misc/class-and-property-qualifiers.md).  

  This class represents state migration that is used in configuring sites for operating system deployment. State migration primarily affects resources, for example, memory, for the state migration point. During migration, user state and settings are copied from one computer to another as part of operating system deployment.  

> [!NOTE]
>  The state migration point requires Internet Information Services (IIS) to be installed.  

 For an example of the use of this class, see How to Create an Association Between Two Computers in Configuration Manager.
