# AddDistributionPoints Method in Class SMS_DriverPackage
The `AddDistributionPoints` Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) class method, in Configuration Manager, adds the distribution points for the driver package.  

> [!NOTE]
>  The `AddDistributionPoints` method allows a list of distribution points to be added to a package.  

 The following syntax is simplified from Managed Object Format (MOF) code and defines the method.  

## Syntax  

```  
SInt32 AddDistributionPoints(  
      String SiteCode[],  
      String NALPath[]  
);  
```  

#### Parameters  
 `SiteCode`  
 Data type: `String` Array  

 Qualifiers: [in]  

 The code for the site to which to add the distribution points.  

 `NALPath`  
 Data type: `String` Array  

 Qualifiers: [in]  

 Network abstraction layer (NAL) path to the distribution points.  

## Return Values  
 An `SInt32` data type that is 0 to indicate success or non-zero to indicate failure.  

 For information about handling returned errors, see [About Configuration Manager Errors](../../../develop/core/understand/about-configuration-manager-errors.md).  

## Remarks  
 It is not necessary to refresh the distribution points when using this method.  

## Requirements  

## Runtime Requirements  
 For more information, see [Configuration Manager Server Runtime Requirements](../../../develop/core/reqs/server-runtime-requirements.md).  

## Development Requirements
