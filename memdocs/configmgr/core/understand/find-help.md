#### Status messages for send a smile
<!--5891852-->
Starting in Configuration Manager 2002, when you **Send a smile** or **Send a frown**, a status message is created when the feedback is submitted. This improvement provides a record of:

- Who submitted the feedback
- The feedback ID
- If the feedback submission was successful or not
   - Message ID of 53900 for a successful submission.
   - Message ID  of 53901 for a failed submission.

### Send a suggestion

When you **Send a suggestion**, you're directed to [UserVoice](https://configurationmanager.uservoice.com/), a third-party website, to share your idea. The Configuration Manager product team uses the following UserVoice status values:

- **Noted** - We understand the request and it makes sense. We've added it to our backlog.
- **Planned** - We've started coding for this feature and expect it to show up in a tech preview build within the next few months.
- **Started** - The feature is now in a tech preview. Go check it out, and give us feedback. Let us know if the feature is on the right track or not. Put additional feedback in the comments section of the original request for others to see and comment on. We'll read that and use the feedback to try to improve the feature.
- **Completed** - The first version of the feature is in a production build. This status doesn't mean we're 100% done with the feature, and will no longer improve it. But it does mean that v1 of the features is in a production build, and you can start using it for real. We're marking it completed because:
  - We want you to know the feature is production ready.
  - We want to give back your UserVoice votes so you can use them on other items.
  - You can file new Design Change Requests to this feature to help us know the next most important improvement for this feature.

- OS build information
- Configuration Manager hierarchy ID

## <a name="bkmk_feedbackid"></a> Confirmation of console feedback

<!--3556010-->
Starting in version 1902, when you send feedback through the Configuration Manager console or UploadOfflineFeedback.exe,  it shows a confirmation message. This message includes a **Feedback ID**, which you can give to Microsoft as a tracking identifier.

- To copy the **Feedback ID**, select the copy icon next to the ID, or use the **CTRL** + **C** key shortcut.
  - This ID isn't stored on your computer, so make sure to copy it before closing the window.
- Clicking on **Do not show this message again** will suppress the dialog box and prevent it from appearing in the future.

   ![Feedback confirmation from the console in Configuration Manager 1902](media/1902-feedback-id-example.png)
- The **UploadOfflineFeedback** command tool writes the **FeedbackID** to the console unless -s or --silent is used.
