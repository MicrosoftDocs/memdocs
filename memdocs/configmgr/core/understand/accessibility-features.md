# Accessibility features in Configuration Manager

*Applies to: Configuration Manager (current branch)*


Configuration Manager includes features to help make it accessible for everyone.

> [!Note]  
> Starting in version 1902, to improve the accessibility features of the Configuration Manager console, update .NET to version 4.7 or later on the computer running the console. <!-- SCCMDocs-pr issue #3228 -->  
> 
> For more information on the accessibility changes made in .NET 4.7.1 and 4.7.2, see [What's new in accessibility in the .NET Framework](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/framework/whats-new/whats-new-in-accessibility).  



## Keyboard shortcuts

- Keyboard navigation through the main view and the ribbon is circular.

- Keyboard navigation in the details pane is circular. To return to the previous object or pane, use Ctrl + D, then Shift + TAB.

- After refreshing a Workspace view, the focus is set to the main pane of that workspace.

- To access a workspace menu, select the Tab key until the Expand/Collapse icon is in focus. Then, select the Down arrow key to access the workspace menu.  

- To navigate through a workspace menu, use the arrow keys.  

- To access different areas in the workspace, use the Tab key and Shift+Tab keys. To navigate within an area of the workspace, such as the ribbon, use the arrow keys.  

- To access the address bar when your focus is in the tree node, use Shift+Tab three times.  

- On a wizard or property page, you can move between the boxes with keyboard shortcuts. Select the Alt key plus the underlined character (Alt+_) to select a specific box.     

- To navigate to the different nodes of a workspace, enter the first letter of the name of a node. Each key press moves the cursor to the next node that begins with that letter. When you're using a screen reader, the reader reads out the name of that node.
