# Supported Configurations for the Long-Term Servicing Branch of System Center Configuration Manager

*Applies to: System Center Configuration Manager (Long-Term Servicing Branch)*

Use the information in this topic to understand what operating systems and product dependencies are supported by the Long-Term Servicing Branch (LTSB) of Configuration Manager.
If not stated otherwise in this or the LTSB specific topics, the same configurations and limitations that apply to the Current Branch version 1606 apply to the LTSB.  When conflicts occur, use the information that applies to the edition you are using. Typically, the LTSB is more limited than the Current Branch.

## General statement of support
The following products and technologies are supported by this branch of Configuration Manager. However, their inclusion in this content does not express an extension of support for any product or version beyond that product's individual support lifecycle. Products that are beyond their support lifecycle are not supported for use with Configuration Manager. For more information, visit the [Microsoft Support Lifecycle](https://support.microsoft.com/lifecycle) website and read the Microsoft Support Lifecycle Policy FAQ.

Additionally, products and product versions that are not listed in the following topics are not supported unless they have been announced on the [Enterprise Mobility + Security Blog](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/enterprise-mobility-security/bg-p/enterprisemobilityandsecurity).

**Limitations for future support:**
The LTSB has limited support for future server and client operating systems and product dependencies. The platforms list for the LTSB is fixed for the life of the release:

**Windows:**
- Only quality and security updates for Windows are supported.
- No support is added for current branches (CB), current branches for business (CBB), or LTSB of Windows 10.
- No support for new major versions of Windows Server.

**SQL Server:**
- Only quality and security updates, or minor upgrades like service packs, is supported for SQL Server.
- No support for new major versions of SQL Server.  

## Site systems and servers
The LTSB supports the use of the following Windows computer operating systems as site systems.  Each operating system has the same requirements and limitations as the same entry in [Supported operating systems for site system servers](../plan-design/configs/supported-operating-systems-for-site-system-servers.md).  For example, the Server Core installation of Windows 2012 R2 must be an x64 version, is only supported to host a distribution point, and does not support PXE or Multicast.
