# Frequently asked questions for Configuration Manager branches and licensing

*Applies to: Configuration Manager (current branch) & System Center Configuration Manager (long-term servicing branch)*

This FAQ addresses common licensing questions about Configuration Manager current branch and the long-term servicing branch (LTSB) versions, available through Microsoft Volume Licensing programs. This article is for informational purposes. It doesn't supersede or replace any documentation covering Configuration Manager licensing. For more information, see the [Product Terms](https://www.microsoftvolumelicensing.com/DocumentSearch.aspx?Mode=3&DocumentTypeId=53). The Product Terms describe the use terms for all Microsoft products in Volume Licensing.

### <a name="bkmk_cb"></a> What's current branch?

The current branch is the production-ready build of Configuration Manager that provides an active servicing model. This servicing model is like the experience with Windows 10. This approach supports customers who are moving at a cloud cadence and wish to innovate more quickly. With the current branch servicing model, you continue to receive new features and functionality. For this reason, only customers with active Software Assurance on Configuration Manager licenses, or with equivalent subscription rights, may install and use the current branch of Configuration Manager.

### <a name="bkmk_ltsb"></a> What's the long-term servicing branch (LTSB)?  

The LTSB is a production-ready build of Configuration Manager. It's intended for customers who allow Software Assurance or equivalent subscription rights to expire. When compared to the current branch, the LTSB has [reduced functionality](introduction-to-the-ltsb.md#features-that-arent-available). Customers who allow Software Assurance or equivalent subscription rights to expire must uninstall the current branch of Configuration Manager. Customers who have perpetual license rights to Configuration Manager may then install and use the LTSB build of the Configuration Manager version that's current at the time of expiration.

### <a name="bkmk_licensing-acronyms"></a> What do the acronyms *SA* and *L&SA* mean in regard to Configuration Manager?

Both **Software Assurance** (SA) and **License and Software Assurance** (L&SA) are license options that grant rights to use Configuration Manager. SA is an option for a customer that's renewing SA coverage from a prior agreement. L&SA is an option for a customer buying a new license and SA coverage.

- **Software Assurance (SA)**: Customers must have active SA on Configuration Manager licenses, or equivalent subscription rights, in order to install and use the current branch option of Configuration Manager.

  While SA is optional for some Microsoft products, the only way to get rights to use Configuration Manager current branch is with SA *or equivalent subscription rights*. For more information, see the [Software Assurance FAQ](https://www.microsoft.com/licensing/licensing-programs/FAQ-Software-Assurance.aspx).

- **Microsoft License and Software Assurance (L&SA)**: Customers buying new licenses for Configuration Manager must acquire L&SA (the license and SA coverage).

  - The SA grants rights to use the current branch.

  - If your SA expires, and you still have a license for Configuration Manager, you can no longer use the current branch. For more information, see the FAQ [If my SA expires and I had L&SA, what do I get?](#bkmk_sa-expires)

For more information about license offerings, see [Ways to buy](https://www.microsoft.com/Licensing/licensing-programs/licensing-programs) and [Licensing Product Terms](https://www.microsoftvolumelicensing.com/ProductResults.aspx?doc=Product%20Terms,OST&fid=64).  

### <a name="bkmk_equiv-sub"></a> What are *equivalent subscriptions*?

Equivalent subscriptions refer to programs like [Enterprise Mobility + Security](https://www.microsoftvolumelicensing.com/ProductResults.aspx?doc=Product%20Terms,OST&fid=51) (EMS) or [Microsoft 365 Enterprise](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/enterprise). There can be others, but these programs are the most common. The Microsoft Volume Licensing Product Terms refers to these programs as Management License Equivalent Licenses.

Configuration Manager is included in the following plans:

- Intune user subscription license (USL)
- EMS E3
- EMS E5
- Microsoft 365 E3
- Microsoft 365 E5
- Microsoft 365 F1

-->

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Configuration Manager isn't included in the [Microsoft 365 Business](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/business) plan.

### <a name="bkmk_mem"></a> Does anything change with the rebrand to Microsoft Endpoint Manager?

Yes. Effective December 1, 2019, if you're already licensed for Configuration Manager, then you're also automatically licensed for Intune for enrolling Windows PCs in [co-management](../../comanage/overview.md). This change makes it easier for you to manage Windows devices with Microsoft Endpoint Manager.

A new license is now available that lets Configuration Manager customers with Software Assurance get Intune PC management rights without having to purchase an additional Intune license for co-management. You no longer need to purchase and assign individual Intune licenses to your users.

- Devices managed by Configuration Manager and enrolled into co-management have almost the same rights as an Intune standalone-managed PC. However, after resetting they can't be re-provisioned by using AutopIlot.

- Windows 10 devices enrolled into Intune by using other means require full Intune licenses.

- If you want to use Intune for managing iOS, Android, or macOS devices, then you do need the appropriate Intune subscription through standalone Intune license, Enterprise Mobility + Security (EMS), or Microsoft 365.

- The licensing that you previously had for System Center Configuration Manager still applies to Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager. If installing a new site, use existing product keys.

### <a name="bkmk_ems-expires"></a> I have Enterprise Mobility + Security and it expired, what must I do now?  

EMS grants rights to use Configuration Manager current branch and long-term service branch. When these rights expire, you no longer have rights to use either branch and must uninstall.  

### <a name="bkmk_sa-expires"></a> If my SA expires, and I had L&SA, what do I get?

If your SA expired after October 1, 2016, depending on what program you acquired L&SA under, you could retain a perpetual license to use the LTSB. If you currently use the current branch, you must uninstall it, and then install the LTSB. There's no support to migrate or convert to the LTSB from the current branch.

If your SA expired before October 1, 2016, and you retained a perpetual license to Configuration Manager, then your only option for ongoing use is to install and use System Center 2012 R2 Configuration Manager and its available service packs. You're required to uninstall the current branch when your SA expires, and reinstall that earlier version of the product. There's no support to migrate to or downgrade from Configuration Manager current branch to prior versions of Configuration Manager.

If you use System Center Endpoint Protection, and your SA expires, you must uninstall it. System Center Endpoint Protection offers no *L (License)* rights, and no perpetual rights.<!--506238-->

### <a name="bkmk_owncb"></a> Do I "own" the current branch?

No. You're licensed to use the current branch while you have active SA. For example, via *L&SA*, when *SA* expires, you then have only *L (License)* rights, which don't include rights to use the current branch. If your L provides perpetual rights, you can use the Configuration Manager LTSB in place of the current branch. If your SA expired prior to October 1, 2016, you can also use System Center 2012 R2 Configuration Manager.

### <a name="bkmk_standalone"></a> Can I purchase Configuration Manager standalone without SA?

No. The only way to get rights to use Configuration Manager is to acquire a license with SA or through an equivalent subscription. There are developer programs like MSDN where Configuration Manager is offered for development and test purposes, but not production usage.

### <a name="bkmk_lab"></a> Does a non-production environment for testing or development require an explicit license?

<!-- SCCMDocs#1848 -->

- If you use the same current branch software as your production environment, you need an explicit license. Check with your account team to determine if your specific license agreement covers multiple instances in multiple environments.

- Some developer programs like MSDN offer products like Configuration Manager for development and test, but not production use.

- For a temporary environment, you can use the [evaluation version](https://www.microsoft.com/evalcenter/evaluate-system-center-configuration-manager-and-endpoint-protection) for 180 days.

- For a lab environment, you can use the [technical preview branch](../get-started/technical-preview.md). Technical preview has the same functionality as current branch, but has some limitations in terms of scale and supported platforms.

### <a name="bkmk_update-rights"></a> Do I have rights to install any update in the Configuration Manager console?

If you have active *SA*, you do have rights.

If you don't have active SA, uninstall the current branch, and then install the LTSB of Configuration Manager. The LTSB doesn't receive updates for incremental versions of Configuration Manager, but does receive security updates based on the Support Lifecycle.

### <a name="bkmk_csp"></a> I have purchased EMS or Microsoft 365 through a Cloud Solution Provider (CSP), do I have rights to use Configuration Manager?

Yes, you have rights to use Configuration Manager to manage clients covered by the EMS license. First download and install the [evaluation software](https://www.microsoft.com/evalcenter/evaluate-system-center-configuration-manager-and-endpoint-protection). Then contact Microsoft Support to obtain the license key.<!--issue472--> When you talk with Microsoft Support, ask them to reference the internal article ID 4033838.<!-- SCCMDocs issue 493 -->

### <a name="bkmk_expiration-date"></a> Is my subscription end-date the same as an SA expiration date?

If *SA* or your subscription is active, you have use rights for Configuration Manager current branch. An active subscription is equivalent of having active *SA*, but no perpetual *"L" (license)*. Once your subscription is over, uninstall the current branch. At this time, you don't have rights to use the LTSB.  

### <a name="bkmk_sql"></a> What are the use rights associated with the SQL technology provided with Configuration Manager?

Configuration Manager includes SQL Server technology. Microsoft's licensing terms for this product allows your use of SQL Server technology only to support Configuration Manager components. SQL Server client access licenses are not required for that use.

Approved use rights for the SQL capabilities with Configuration Manager include:

- Site database role
- Windows Server Update Services (WSUS) for software update point role
- SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS) for reporting point role
- Data warehouse service point role
- Database replicas for management point roles

The SQL Server license that's included with Configuration Manager supports each instance of SQL Server that you install to host a database for Configuration Manager. However, only databases for Configuration Manager in the preceding list can run on that SQL Server when you use this license. If a database for any additional Microsoft or third-party product shares the SQL Server, you must have a separate license for that SQL Server instance.

### <a name="bkmk_opmdm"></a> Does on-premises mobile device management (MDM) require an Intune subscription?

In versions 1806 and earlier, to start using on-premises MDM, you need a Microsoft Intune subscription. The subscription is only required to track licensing of the devices and isn't used to manage or store management information for the devices. All management data is stored in your organization using the on-premises Configuration Manager infrastructure.  

Starting in version 1810, an Intune connection is no longer required for new on-premises MDM deployments.<!--3607730, fka 1359124--> Your organization still requires Intune licenses to use this feature. For more information, see the [Intune support blog post](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Intune-Customer-Success/Move-from-Hybrid-Mobile-Device-Management-to-Intune-on-Azure/ba-p/280150).
