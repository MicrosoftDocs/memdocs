# Technical preview for Configuration Manager

*Applies to: Configuration Manager (technical preview branch)*

This article provides details about the monthly technical preview branch of Configuration Manager. The technical preview introduces new functionality that Microsoft is working on. It introduces new features that aren't yet included in the current branch of Configuration Manager. These features might eventually be included in an update to the current branch. Before we finalize the features, we want you to try them out and give us feedback.

Because this release is a technical preview, details and functionality are subject to change.

This information applies to all versions of the Configuration Manager technical preview branch. This article lists each new feature along with the technical preview version in which it first appears. For example, version **2001** for January (`01`) of 2020 (`20`). Separate articles dedicated to each preview version detail the individual features.

For information about what's new in the *current branch* of Configuration Manager, see [What's new in Configuration Manager incremental versions](../plan-design/changes/whats-new-incremental-versions.md).

## <a name="bkmk_reqs"></a> Requirements and limitations

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The technical preview is licensed for use only in a lab environment. Microsoft may not provide support services and certain features may not be available in technical previews. Additionally, technical preview software may have reduced or different security, privacy, accessibility, availability, and reliability standards relative to commercially provided software.

For most product prerequisites, use the information in the [Supported configurations](../plan-design/configs/supported-configurations.md). The following exceptions apply to the technical preview branch:

- Each install is active for 90 days before it becomes inactive.

- English is the only language supported.

- It only supports the following setup command-line parameters:

  - `/silent`
  - `/testdbupgrade`

- The service connection point installs to online mode. It doesn't support offline mode.

- The separate articles for each specific version of the technical preview include additional limitations or requirements, as applicable.

- The following features aren't supported with the technical preview branch:

  - [Migration](../migration/migrate-data-between-hierarchies.md) to or from this preview branch.

  - [Upgrade](../servers/deploy/install/upgrade-to-configuration-manager.md) to this preview branch.

  - [Site recovery](../servers/manage/recover-sites.md) from the cd.latest folder.<!--507106-->

- There's no support for updating to current branch from this preview branch.

    > [!Note]
    > When updates are available for a preview version, you still find and install them from the **Updates and Servicing** node of the Configuration Manager console. For a video of the in-console upgrade process, see [Installing Configuration Manager update packages](https://www.youtube.com/embed/KBd_EGFbUT8) on youtube.com.

- It only supports a standalone primary site. There's no support for a central administration site, multiple primary sites, or secondary sites.

The technical preview branch of Configuration Manager supports the following products and technologies:

- It only supports the following versions of **SQL Server**:

  - SQL Server 2017 (with cumulative update 2 or later)
  - SQL Server 2016 (with no service pack or later)
  - SQL Server 2014 (with service pack 1 or later)
  - SQL Server 2012 (with service pack 3 or later)

- The site supports up to 10 clients, which can run any [supported client OS version](../plan-design/configs/supported-operating-systems-for-clients-and-devices.md).<!-- SCCMDocs#1656 -->

> [!Note]
> The inclusion of these products in this content doesn't imply an extension of support for a version that's beyond its support lifecycle. Configuration Manager doesn't support products that are beyond their support lifecycle. For more information, see [Microsoft Lifecycle Policy](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=208270).

## <a name="bkmk_install"></a> Install and update

The Configuration Manager technical preview branch for lab use is distinct from the Configuration Manager current branch for production use.

First install a baseline version of the technical preview branch. After installing a baseline version, then use in-console updates to bring your installation up to date with the most recent preview version. Typically, new versions of the technical preview are available each month.

Microsoft supports each technical preview version up until three successive versions are available. For example, when version 1908 released, version 1904 was no longer in support. Versions 1905, 1906, and 1907 remained in support. When a baseline falls out of support, it's still supported for installing a new technical preview site, assuming you immediately update to a supported version. The older baseline is supported until a new baseline version is available. Update to the latest available version from the baseline, and then repeat the update process until you install the latest technical preview version.

> [!TIP]
> When you install an update to the technical preview, you update your preview installation to that new technical preview version. A technical preview installation never has the option to upgrade to a current branch installation. It also never receives updates from the current branch release.
>
> Several times throughout the year, there are technical preview branch and current branch versions with the same version number. For example, there is a technical preview version 1910 and a current branch version 1910.

### Active baseline versions

Install a baseline version for up to one year after its release. When you install a new technical preview site, use the latest baseline version.

- **Technical preview version 2002**: The Configuration Manager technical preview branch version 2002 is available as both an in-console update and as a new baseline version.

Download a baseline version from the [TechNet Evaluation Center](https://www.microsoft.com/evalcenter/evaluate-system-center-configuration-manager-and-endpoint-protection-technical-preview).
