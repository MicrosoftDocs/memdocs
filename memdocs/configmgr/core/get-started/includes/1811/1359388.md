## <a name="bkmk_tsmedia"></a> Improvements to task sequence media creation 
<!--1359388-->

These improvements are based on the following UserVoice ideas:  
- [Specify drive to cache data for creating task sequence media](https://configurationmanager.uservoice.com/forums/300492-ideas/suggestions/34061488-specify-drive-to-cache-data-for-creating-task-sequ)  
- [BootMedia Version and PackageID](https://configurationmanager.uservoice.com/forums/300492-ideas/suggestions/32117215-bootmedia-version-and-packageid)  


### Specify temporary storage

When you create task sequence media, now customize the location that the site uses for temporary storage of data. This process can require much temporary drive space. This change gives you greater flexibility to choose where to store these temporary files. 

In the **Create Task Sequence Media Wizard**, specify a location for the **Staging folder**. By default this location is similar to the following path: `%UserProfile%\AppData\Local\Temp`.


### Add a label to the media

You can now add a label to task sequence media. This label helps you better identify the media after you create it.

In the **Create Task Sequence Media Wizard**, specify a **Media label**. The default value is `Configuration Manager`. This text field appears in the following locations:  

- If you mount an ISO file, Windows displays this label as the name of the mounted drive  

- If you format a USB drive, it uses the first 11 characters of the label as its name  

- Configuration Manager writes a text file called `MediaLabel.txt` to the root of the media. By default, the file includes a single line of text: `label=Configuration Manager`. If you customize the label for media, this line uses your custom label instead of the default value.
