## <a name="bkmk_wakeup"></a> Changes to client notification action to wake up a device
<!--1317364-->

This version of Configuration Manager technical preview includes the following changes to the wake on LAN behavior. For more general information on the feature, see [New client notification action to wake up device](../../capabilities-in-technical-preview-1810.md#bkmk_wakeup).

#### New client setting to allow network wake-up
Previously you had to manually enable the client for wake on LAN in the properties of the network adapter. This version includes a new client setting, **Allow network wake-up**. Configure and deploy this setting instead of the manual action. 

#### Only wake up a single device
You can't start this client notification action when you select more than one device or on a collection. Wake up devices one at a time. Send [Feedback](../../../understand/product-feedback.md) with your thoughts on the feature and when you need to wake up more than one device at a time.
