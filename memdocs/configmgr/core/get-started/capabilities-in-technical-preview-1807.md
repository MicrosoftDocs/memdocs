## <a name="bkmk_hub"></a> Community Hub
<!--1357766-->

- Scripts
- Configuration items

![Configuration Manager console, Community workspace, Hub node](media/1357766-hub.png)

To see more details about an available item, click it in the hub. From the details page, click **Download** to acquire the item. When you download an item from the hub, it's automatically added to your site. 

![Configuration Manager console, Community workspace, Hub node, details page](media/1357766-hub-details.png)

The **Community** workspace also includes the following nodes:

- **Documentation**: Displays the Configuration Manager [documentation library](/sccm/)  

- **Feedback**: Displays the Configuration Manager product feedback site


### Prerequisites

- Use the Configuration Manager console on a client OS.  

    - Alternatively but not recommended: on a server OS, disable [Internet Explorer: Enhanced Security Configuration](/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2008-R2-and-2008/dd883248(v=ws.10)).

- The computer with the console requires internet access, and connectivity to the following sites:  
    - `https://aka.ms`  
    - `https://comfigmgr-hub.azurewebsites.net`  
    - `https://configmgronline.visualstudio.com`  


### Known issue

Contributing items to the hub isn't currently available in this version. 



## <a name="bkmk_osd"></a> Specify the drive for offline OS image servicing  
<!--1358924-->

Based on your feedback, now specify the drive that Configuration Manager uses during offline servicing of OS images. This process can consume a large amount of disk space with temporary files, so this option gives you flexibility to select the drive to use.


### Try it out!

Try to complete the tasks. Then send [Feedback](capabilities-in-technical-preview-1804.md#bkmk_feedback) with your thoughts on the feature.

1. In the Configuration Manager console, go to the **Administration** workspace, expand **Site Configuration**, and select the **Sites** node. In the ribbon, click **Configure Site Components** and select **Software Update Point**.  

2. Switch to the **Offline Servicing** tab, and specify the option for **A local drive to be used by offline servicing of images**.  

By default, this setting is **Automatic**. With this value, Configuration Manager selects the drive on which it's installed. 

During offline servicing, Configuration Manager stores temporary files in the folder, `<drive>:\ConfigMgr_OfflineImageServicing`. It also mounts the OS images in this folder. 

Review the **OfflineServicingMgr.log** log file. 



## <a name="bkmk_comgmt"></a> Co-managed device sync activity from Intune
<!--1358565-->

Display in the Configuration Manager console whether a co-managed device is active with Microsoft Intune. This state is based on data from the [Intune Data Warehouse](/mem/intune/developer/reports-nav-create-intune-reports). The **Client Status** dashboard in the Configuration Manager console shows **Inactive clients using Intune**. This new category is for co-managed devices that are inactive with Configuration Manager, but have synchronized with the Intune service in the past week.


### Try it out!

Try to complete the tasks. Then send [Feedback](capabilities-in-technical-preview-1804.md#bkmk_feedback) with your thoughts on the feature.

If you've already set up your site for co-management: 

1. In the Configuration Manager console, go to the **Administration** workspace, expand **Cloud Services**, and select the **Co-management** node. Click **Properties** in the ribbon.  

2. Switch to the **Reporting** tab. Click **Sign In** and authenticate. Then click **Update** to enable read permissions for the Intune Data Warehouse.  

3. After the site syncs with Intune, go to the **Monitoring** workspace, and select the **Client Status** node. In the **Overall Client Status** section, see the row for **Inactive clients using Intune**.  

For more information about enabling co-management, see [Co-management for Windows 10 devices](../../comanage/overview.md).



## <a name="bkmk_app-repair"></a> Repair applications
<!--1357866-->

Based on your feedback, now specify a repair command line for Windows Installer and Script Installer deployment types.


### Try it out!

Try to complete the tasks. Then send [Feedback](capabilities-in-technical-preview-1804.md#bkmk_feedback) with your thoughts on the feature.

1. In the Configuration Manager console, open the properties of a Windows Installer or Script Installer deployment type.  

2. Switch to the **Programs** tab. Specify the **Repair program** command.  

3. Deploy the app. On the **Deployment Settings** tab of the deployment, enable the option to **Allow end users to attempt to repair this application**.  


### Known issue

The new button in Software Center for users to **Repair** the app isn't visible in this version.  



## <a name="bkmk_email-approve"></a> Approve application requests via email
<!--1321550-->

Configure email notifications for application approval requests. When a user requests an application, you receive an email. Click links in the email to approve or deny the request, without requiring the Configuration Manager console.


### Prerequisites

#### To send email notifications
- Enable the [optional feature](../servers/manage/optional-features.md) **Approve application requests for users per device**.  

- Configure [email notification for alerts](../servers/manage/configure-alerts.md#configure-email-notification-for-alerts).  

#### To approve or deny requests from email
If you don't configure these prerequisites, the site sends email notification for application requests without links to approve or deny the request.  

- In the site properties, **Enable REST endpoint for all providers roles on this site and allow Configuration Manager cloud management gateway traffic**. For more information, see [OData endpoint data access](capabilities-in-technical-preview-1612.md#odata-endpoint-data-access).  

    - Restart the SMS_EXEC service after enabling the REST endpoint

- [Cloud management gateway](../clients/manage/cmg/overview.md)  

- Onboard the site to [Azure services](../servers/deploy/configure/azure-services-wizard.md) for **Cloud Management**  

    - Enable [Microsoft Entra user Discovery](../servers/deploy/configure/configure-discovery-methods.md#azureaadisc)  

    - Manually configure the following settings for this native app in Microsoft Entra ID:  

        - **Redirect URI**: `https://<CMG FQDN>/CCM_Proxy_ServerAuth/ImplicitAuth`. Use the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the cloud management gateway (CMG) service, for example, GraniteFalls.Contoso.com.   

        - **Manifest**: set **oauth2AllowImplicitFlow** to true: `"oauth2AllowImplicitFlow": true,`  


### Try it out!

Try to complete the tasks. Then send [Feedback](capabilities-in-technical-preview-1804.md#bkmk_feedback) with your thoughts on the feature.

1. In the Configuration Manager console, deploy an application as available to a user collection. On the **Deployment Settings** page, enable it for approval. Then enter a *single* email address to receive notification.  

     > [!Note]  
     > Anyone in your Microsoft Entra organization who receives the email can approve the request. Don't forward the email to others unless you want them to take action.  

2. As a user, request the application in Software Center.  

3. You receive an email notification similar to the following example:  

![Example email notification for application approval](media/1321550-email.png)

> [!Note]  
> The link to approve or deny is for one-time use. For example, you configure a group alias to receive notifications. Meg approves the request. Now Bruce can't deny the request.  



## <a name="bkmk_script"></a> Improvement to script output
<!--1236459-->

You can now view detailed script output in raw or structured JSON format. This formatting makes the output easier to read and analyze. If the script returns valid JSON-formatted text, then view the detailed output as either **JSON Output** or **Raw Output**. Otherwise the only option is **Script Output**. 

#### Example: Script output is valid JSON
Command: `$PSVersionTable.PSVersion`  

``` Output
Major  Minor  Build  Revision
-----  -----  -----  --------
5      1      16299  551
```

#### Example: Script output isn't valid JSON
Command: `Write-Output (Get-WmiObject -Class Win32_OperatingSystem).Caption`  

``` Output
Microsoft Windows 10 Enterprise
```


### Try it out!

Try to complete the tasks. Then send [Feedback](capabilities-in-technical-preview-1804.md#bkmk_feedback) with your thoughts on the feature.

1. In the Configuration Manager console, go to the **Assets and Compliance** workspace, and select the **Device Collections** node. Right-click a collection, and select **Run Script**. For more information on creating and running scripts, see [Create and run PowerShell scripts from the Configuration Manager console](../../apps/deploy-use/create-deploy-scripts.md).  

2. Run a script on the target collection.
