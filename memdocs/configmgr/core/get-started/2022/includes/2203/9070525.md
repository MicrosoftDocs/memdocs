## <a name="bkmk_dark"></a> Dark theme for the console
<!--9070525-->
The Configuration Manager console now offers a dark theme. To use the theme, select the arrow from the top left of the ribbon, then choose **Switch console theme**. Select **Switch console theme** again to return to the light theme. Using a console theme can help you easily distinguish a test environment from a production environment or one hierarchy from another.

The console dark theme is a [pre-release](../../../../servers/manage/pre-release-features.md) feature. Currently, there are certain locations in the console that may not display the dark theme correctly.

### Known issue

When you first switch to a different theme, you may notice the node navigation pane doesn't properly render when you move to a new workspace. To work around this issue, restart the console.
