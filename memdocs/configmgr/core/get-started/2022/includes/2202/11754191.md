## <a name="bkmk_feedback"></a> Improvements for sending feedback
<!--11754191, 12890088-->

- You now have the ability to connect feedback you send to Microsoft through the Configuration Manager console to an authenticated Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) user account. User authentication will help Microsoft ensure the privacy of your feedback and diagnostic data.
   - Currently, Azure AD authentication for government clouds isn't available.
- The feedback button is now displayed in additional console locations.
   - The following keyboard shortcuts for opening the feedback wizard have also been added to more locations in the console:
      - **Send a smile**: ALT + SHIFT + 7
      - **Send a frown**: ALT + SHIFT + 8

### Try it out!

Try to complete the tasks. Then send [Feedback](../../../../understand/product-feedback.md) with your thoughts on the feature.

1. In the Configuration Manager console, select the feedback icon in the upper right corner.
1. Select either **Send a smile** or **Send a frown**.
1. Select **Sign in** and sign in with your Azure AD user account.
   - Selecting **Continue without signing in** will allow you to send feedback, but we won't be able to contact you with questions or updates.
1. Once you're signed in, select **Next** then [provide your feedback](../../../../understand/product-feedback.md). If you need to use a different account, you can select **Sign out** to start again.
