## <a name="bkmk_pre-download"></a> Pre-download content for available software updates
<!--4497776-->
Admins can now pre-download content for software updates that are included in available deployments. Required deployments already pre-download content by default. Enabling this new setting reduces installation wait times for clients since installation notifications won't be visible in Software Center until the content has fully downloaded.

The **Pre-download content for this deployment** setting is available in the following locations:

- The **Deployment Settings** page of the **Deploy Software Updates Wizard** for [manually created](../../../../../sum/deploy-use/manually-deploy-software-updates.md) software update deployments
- The **Deployment Settings** page of the **Automatic Deployment Rules Wizard** for update deployments created with an [automatic deployment rule](../../../../../sum/deploy-use/automatically-deploy-software-updates.md)
- The **Deployment Settings** tab in the **Properties** page for a deployment created manually or with an automatic deployment rule.

> [!NOTE]
> If an update is in multiple deployments for a client and the **Pre-download content for this deployment** setting is enabled for a least one of the deployments, then the content will pre-download.
