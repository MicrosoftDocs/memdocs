## <a name="bkmk_webview2"></a> Improvements to dashboards
<!--10024154-->
Dashboards, such as the [Windows Servicing](../../../../../osd/deploy-use/manage-windows-as-a-service.md#bkmk_2103-dashboard) and [Microsoft Edge Management](../../../../../apps/deploy-use/deploy-edge.md#view-the-dashboard) dashboards, now use the Microsoft Edge WebView2 Runtime. To use dashboards, install the [WebView2 console extension](../../../../servers/manage/admin-console-extensions.md#get-console-extensions) then reopen the console.
