## <a name="bkmk_notify"></a> Deployment Status client notification actions
<!--7079837-->
You can now perform client notification actions, including **Run Scripts**, from the **Deployment Status** view. To run client notification actions from the **Deployment Status** view:
1. Go to the **Deployments** node in the **Monitoring** workspace.
1. Select a deployment, then select **View Status**, or double-click on the deployment.
1. Right-click on either a group of clients in a **Category** or a single client in the **Asset details** pane to display the client notification actions.
   - Currently, any user can perform these actions, but they’ll receive a permissions error if they don't have the correct permissions.
   - Currently, when there are no devices associated with the deployment status, the client notification actions display but won't trigger any notifications.
