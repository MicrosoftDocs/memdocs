## <a name="bkmk_timeout"></a> Script execution timeout for compliance settings
<!--14120481-->
You can now define a **Script Execution Timeout (seconds)** when configuring [client settings](../../../../clients/deploy/about-client-settings.md#compliance-settings) for compliance settings. The timeout value can be set from a minimum of 60 seconds to a maximum of 600 seconds. This new setting allows you more flexibility for configuration items when you need to run scripts that may exceed the default of 60 seconds.
