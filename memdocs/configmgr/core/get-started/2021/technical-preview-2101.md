## Known issues
### Unable to upload files when sending a frown through the console
<!--9238008-->
When filing a frown from the Configuration Manager console, files won't be uploaded.  

**Mitigation:** To work around this issue, you'll need to edit the `microsoft.configurationmanagement.exe.config` file located in the admin console installation directory. Use the instruction below to work around the issue:

1. Open **Notepad** as administrator.
1. From Notepad, choose **File** then **Open**.
1. Browse to the Configuration Manager console installation directory and open the file named `Microsoft.ConfigurationManagement.exe.config`. 
   - The default location is `C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Endpoint Manager\AdminConsole\bin\Microsoft.ConfigurationManagement.exe.config`

1. In the `<runtime>` section, add the following text:

   ```text
       <assemblyBinding xmlns="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:asm.v1">
         <dependentAssembly>
           <assemblyIdentity name="Microsoft.WindowsAzure.Storage" publicKeyToken="31bf3856ad364e35" culture="neutral" />
           <bindingRedirect oldVersion="0.0.0.0-8.7.0.0" newVersion="6.2.0.0" />
         </dependentAssembly>
       </assemblyBinding>
   ```
