### Unable to install an existing console extensions after site upgrade
<!--12580525-->

After a site upgrade, console extensions that aren't built into Configuration Manager won't install for new consoles. If the extension was already installed on a console, that console may continue to use the extension.
#### Workaround

To work around this issue, [delete the extension](../../../../servers/manage/admin-console-extensions.md#about-the-console-extensions-node) from the **Console Extensions** node. Redownload the extension from Community hub or reimport the extension and enable notifications for it as needed.
