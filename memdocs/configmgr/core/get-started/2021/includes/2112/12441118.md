## <a name="bkmk_warehouse"></a> Exclude data warehouse reporting tables from synchronization

<!--12441118-->

When you install the [data warehouse](../../../../servers/manage/data-warehouse.md), it synchronizes a set of default tables from the site database. These tables are required for data warehouse reports. While troubleshooting issues, you may want to stop synchronizing these default tables. Starting in this release, you can exclude one or more of these required tables from synchronization.

### Try it out!

Try to complete the tasks. Then send [Feedback](../../../../understand/product-feedback.md) with your thoughts on the feature.

1. When you install or configure the properties of the data warehouse, on the **Synchronization settings** page, choose **Select tables**.

1. In the **Database tables** window, deselect one or more tables of type **Required**.

1. The console will prompt you to confirm the change, since some reports may no longer work correctly.
