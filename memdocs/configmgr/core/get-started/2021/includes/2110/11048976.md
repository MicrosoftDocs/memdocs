## <a name="bkmk_audit"></a> Status messages for console extensions

<!--11048976-->

To improve the visibility and transparency of [console extensions](../../../../servers/manage/admin-console-extensions.md), the site now creates status messages for related events. These status messages have IDs from **54201** to **54208**. They all include the following information:

- The user that made the change
- The ID of the extension
- The version of the extension

There are four categories of message events:

- Required or optional
- Approve or disapprove
- Enable or disable
- Tombstone or untombstone

For example, the description of status message ID **54201** is **User `"%1"` made console extension with ID `"%2"` and version `"%3"` required**.

Use these status messages to make sure your site uses known and trusted console extensions.
