## <a name="bkmk_brand"></a> Branding in the Windows Update native reboot experience
<!--10543514-->
You can now add branding information when using the native Windows restart experience for software updates. To use this feature, client devices must be running Windows Insider build 21277 or later. From the **Computer Restart** client device settings, ensure that **Windows** is selected as the restart experience. For the **Specify organization name** option, enter the organization name to display in the restart notifications. Branding information will be included in the Windows restart notification for updates that require restart.
