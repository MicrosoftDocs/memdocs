## <a name="bkmk_365"></a> Enable update notifications from Microsoft 365 Apps
<!--10628998-->
You can now configure the end-user experience for Microsoft 365 Apps updates. This client setting allows you to enable or disable notifications from Microsoft 365 Apps for these updates. The new **Enable update notifications from Microsoft 365 Apps** option has been added to the **Software Updates** group of [client settings](../../../../clients/deploy/configure-client-settings.md). The following options are available for the setting:

- **No**: Doesn't display Microsoft 365 Apps updates notifications from Microsoft 365 Apps (default)
- **Yes**: Displays Microsoft 365 Apps updates notifications from Microsoft 365 Apps

### End-user experience for update notifications from Microsoft 365 Apps

Which notifications are displayed to the user about updates for Microsoft 365 Apps is also determined by the settings for per deployment notifications from Software Center. If deployment notifications from Software Center are disabled, then the end user won't receive any notifications from either Software Center or Microsoft 365 Apps, regardless of how notifications from Microsoft 365 Apps are set. If notifications from both Software Center and Microsoft 365 Apps are enabled, then the end user will receive notifications from Software Center and Microsoft 365 Apps. Below is a chart of which notifications for Microsoft 365 Apps updates are displayed to the end user for these settings:</br></br>
