## <a name="bkmk_csv"></a> Export to CSV
<!--9663857-->
You can now export the contents of a grid view in the console along with the column headers to a comma-separated values (CSV) file that can be used to import to Excel or other applications. While you could previously cut and paste from a grid view, exporting to CSV makes extracting a large number of rows faster and easier. You can export either all or selected items from the following nodes:

- Device Collections
- User Collections
- Devices
- Users

To export the information, select **Export to CSV file** from either the ribbon or the right-click menu. Choose **Export selected items** to only export items you've already selected, or you can choose to **Export all items**.
