## <a name="bkmk_dotnetprereq"></a> .NET version 4.6.2 prerequisite check is an error

<!--10644702-->

Configuration Manager current branch version 2107 has a warning [prerequisite rule that checks for Microsoft .NET Framework version 4.6.2](../../../../servers/deploy/install/list-of-prerequisite-checks.md#required-version-of-microsoft-net-framework-warning). This version of .NET is required on site servers, specific site systems, clients, and the Configuration Manager console.

Starting in this technical preview release, this prerequisite rule for .NET 4.6.2 is an error. Until you upgrade .NET, you can't continue installing or updating the site to this version of Configuration Manager.

> [!NOTE]
> If possible in your environment, .NET version 4.8 is recommended. Before you run setup to install or update the site, first update .NET and restart the system. For more information, [Site and site system prerequisites](../../../../plan-design/configs/site-and-site-system-prerequisites.md#net-version-requirements).
