## <a name="bkmk_isvproxy"></a> Copy GUID for ISV proxy certificate

<!--2842082-->

Independent Software Vendors (ISVs) can create applications that extend Configuration Manager. They can use Configuration Manager to assign a certificate to an ISV proxy, which enables custom communication with the management point.

To simplify the management of these ISV proxy certificates, you can now copy its GUID in the Configuration Manager console.

1. In the Configuration Manager console, go to the **Administration** workspace.

1. Expand **Security**, and select the **Certificates** node.

1. Sort the list of the certificates by the **Type** column.

1. Select a certificate of type **ISV Proxy**.

1. In the ribbon, select **Copy Certificate GUID**.

This action copies this certificate's GUID, for example: `aa05bf38-5cd6-43ea-ac61-ab101f943987`
