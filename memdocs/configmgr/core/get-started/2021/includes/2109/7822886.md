## <a name="bkmk_vpn"></a> Improvements to VPN boundary types

<!--7822886-->

If you use the [VPN boundary type](../../../../servers/deploy/configure/boundaries.md#vpn), you can now match the start of a connection name or description instead of the whole string. Some third-party VPN drivers dynamically create the connection, which starts with a consistent string but also has a unique connection identifier. For example, `Virtual network adapter #19`. When you use the **Connection name** or **Connection description** options, also use the new **Starts with** option.
