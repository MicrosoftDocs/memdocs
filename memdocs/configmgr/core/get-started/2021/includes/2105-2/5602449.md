## <a name="bkmk_diaginv"></a> Hardware inventory for client log settings

<!--5602449-->

You can now inventory client log file settings such as log levels and size. This behavior allows you to track settings that you change by the [Client Diagnostics](../../../../clients/manage/client-notification.md#client-diagnostics) actions. This new inventory class isn't enabled by default.

For more information on client log file settings, see [About log files](../../../../plan-design/hierarchy/about-log-files.md#configure-logging-options).

### Try it out!

Try to complete the tasks. Then send [Feedback](../../../../understand/product-feedback.md) with your thoughts on the feature.

1. In the Configuration Manager console, edit the default or any custom client settings. For more information, see [Enable or disable existing hardware inventory classes](../../../../clients/manage/inventory/extend-hardware-inventory.md#enable-or-disable-existing-classes).

1. Enable the new inventory class, **Client Diagnostics (CCM_ClientDiagnostics)**. This class includes the following attributes:

    - Debug Logging Enabled
    - Logging Enabled
    - Log Level
    - History File Count
    - Max Log File Size

1. For a device, [download computer policy](../../../../clients/manage/manage-clients.md#start-policy-retrieval) and then use the client notification action to [Collect hardware inventory](../../../../clients/manage/client-notification.md#collect-hardware-inventory).

1. After the client completes the inventory cycle, use [Resource Explorer to view the hardware inventory](../../../../clients/manage/inventory/use-resource-explorer-to-view-hardware-inventory.md).
