## <a name="bkmk_av"></a> Tenant attach: Antivirus policy supports exclusions merge
<!--9089764-->

When a tenant attached device is targeted with two or more [antivirus policies](../../../../../tenant-attach/deploy-antivirus-policy.md), the settings for antivirus exclusions will merge before being applied to the client. This change results in the client receiving the exclusions defined in each policy, allowing for more granular control of antivirus exclusions.

### Try it out!

Try to complete the tasks. Then send [Feedback](../../../../understand/find-help.md#product-feedback) with your thoughts on the feature.

#### Prerequisites

- All of the prerequisites for [Tenant attach: Create and deploy endpoint security policies from the admin center](../../../../../tenant-attach/deploy-antivirus-policy.md).
- The latest version of the Configuration Manager client installed

#### Create two policies with different antivirus exclusions

1. Create an antivirus policy from the [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431) that includes some [antivirus exclusions](../../../../../../intune/protect/antivirus-microsoft-defender-settings-windows-tenant-attach.md?toc=/mem/configmgr/tenant-attach/toc.json&bc=/mem/configmgr/tenant-attach/breadcrumb/toc.json#microsoft-defender-antivirus-exclusions).
1. Create a second antivirus policy including only antivirus exclusions that are different from the first policy.
1. [Assign both antivirus policies](../../../../../tenant-attach/deploy-antivirus-policy.md#bkmk_av) to the same collection.
1. Observe the results on a client in the targeted collection. Antivirus exclusions from both policies are applied.
