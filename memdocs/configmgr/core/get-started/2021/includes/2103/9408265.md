## <a name="bkmk_cmgtls"></a> New CMG deployments use TLS 1.2

<!--9408265-->

Starting in this release, new deployments of the cloud management gateway (CMG) by default enable the option to **Enforce TLS 1.2**. This change doesn't affect existing deployments. While not recommended, if you need to use the less secure TLS protocol versions, you can still disable this option.

For more information, see the following articles:

- [Cloud management gateway overview](../../../../clients/manage/cmg/overview.md)

- [How to enable TLS 1.2](../../../../plan-design/security/enable-tls-1-2.md)
