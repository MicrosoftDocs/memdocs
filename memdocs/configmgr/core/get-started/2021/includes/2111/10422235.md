## <a name="bkmk_tsdt"></a> Improvement to task sequence deployment type

<!--10422235-->

Consider the following scenario:

- An application has a [task sequence deployment type](../../../../../apps/get-started/creating-windows-applications.md#bkmk_tsdt).
- It's deployed as available.
- A device has maintenance windows defined.
- A user on the device runs the deployment in Software Center outside of a maintenance window.

Configuration Manager honors the user's intent to install the application, even though there's no available maintenance window. Previously, when the task sequence ran, the **Restart Computer** step would fail because of the maintenance window.

Based on your feedback, this step now ignores maintenance windows only when the task sequence is run as an app deployment type.
