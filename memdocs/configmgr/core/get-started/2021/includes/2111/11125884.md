## <a name="bkmk_appgroup"></a> Improvement to app groups

<!--11125884-->

This release resolves one of the [known issues for app groups from version 2110](../../technical-preview-2110.md#bkmk_appgroups). View and managing app groups in the Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center doesn't require an elevated role. It honors permissions and scopes as defined in Configuration Manager. For example, your user account requires the **Approve** permission on an app group to approve it for installation from the admin center. This behavior is consistent with applications.
