## <a name="bkmk_permission"></a> Simplified CMPivot permissions requirements
<!--7898885-->
We've simplified the CMPivot permissions requirements. The following changes have been made:
- CMPivot no longer requires **SMS Scripts** read permission
   - The [administration service](../../../../../develop/adminservice/overview.md) still requires this permission when falling back to use the SMS Provider when a 503 (Service Unavailable) error is received, as seen in the CMPivot.log
- The **default scope** permission isnâ€™t required.

### CMPivot permissions by Configuration Manager version

|1902 and earlier|1906|2101 technical preview and later|
|---|---|---|
|**Read** permission on **SMS Scripts**|**Read** permission on **SMS Scripts**|N/A|
|**Run Script** permission on the **Collection**|**Run CMPivot** permission on the **Collection**|**Run CMPivot** permission on the **Collection**|
|**Read** permission on **Inventory Reports**|**Read** permission on **Inventory Reports**|**Read** permission on **Inventory Reports**|
|**Default scope** permission|**Default scope** permission|N/A|

> [!NOTE] 
> The new permissions are only applicable for CMPivot in the on-premises console. Currently these new permissions won't work for CMPivot standalone. If you're using CMPivot standalone, you will still need the **SMS Scripts** read right and the **default scope**. Currently, the following limitations also apply:
>   - CMPivot in the on-premises console requires **SMS Scripts** read right when viewing, saving, and deleting favorite queries.
>   - CMPivot in the on-premises console can't create a collection from the CMPivot results.
