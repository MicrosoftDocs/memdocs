## <a name="bkmk_webview"></a> Client setting for displaying Software Center custom tabs

<!--9142301-->

Technical preview version 2012 included an [improved user experience and security with Software Center custom tabs](../../../2020/technical-preview-2012.md#bkmk_swctr). It required that you manually deploy the Microsoft Edge WebView2 browser control.

Starting in this release, you can now configure a client setting to use the WebView2 runtime.

### Try it out!

Try to complete the tasks. Then send [Feedback](/configmgr/core/understand/find-help#product-feedback) with your thoughts on the feature.

1. In the [Software Center](../../../../clients/deploy/about-client-settings.md#software-center) group of client settings, **Customize** Software Center settings.

1. On the **Tabs** tab, enable the option to **Display custom tabs with Microsoft Edge WebView2 runtime**.

If it's not already installed, the Configuration Manager client installs the **Microsoft Edge WebView2 runtime (fixed version)** on the device.

For more information, see [How to configure client settings](../../../../clients/deploy/configure-client-settings.md).

> [!NOTE]
> If the client device isn't running .NET Framework version 4.6.2 or later, it falls back to use the Internet Explorer browser control.<!-- 8655543 -->
