## <a name="bkmk_oms"></a> Prerequisite rule for deprecated Azure Monitor connector

<!--8269855-->

We continue to see broad adoption of native Azure Monitor log query groups as customers shift more of their workloads to the cloud. Because of this reason, starting in November 2020, the Configuration Manager feature to synchronize collections to Azure Monitor is deprecated.

When you update to this release, a new prerequisite check warns about the presence of the [Log Analytics connector for Azure Monitor](/azure/azure-monitor/platform/collect-sccm?context=%2fmem%2fconfigmgr%2fcore%2fcontext%2fcore-context). (This feature is called the *OMS Connector* in the Azure Services wizard.) This connector is deprecated, and will be removed from the product in a future release. At that time, this check will be an error that blocks upgrade.

For more information, see [Removed and deprecated features](../../../../plan-design/changes/deprecated/removed-and-deprecated-cmfeatures.md).
