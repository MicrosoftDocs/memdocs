## <a name="bkmk_distmsg"></a> Manage aged distribution point messages

<!--8561493-->

In some environments, a small number of error status messages for a distribution point can cause the entire server status to show an error state. This behavior could be due to a known issue when failing to distribute content. To help you better manage the state of distribution points, this release includes the following improvements:

- Delete a specific distribution point status message. Go to the **Monitoring** workspace, expand **Distribution Status**, and select **Distribution Point Configuration Status**. Select a server, and switch to the **Details** tab in the bottom pane. Select a message, and then in the ribbon, select **Delete**.

- Delete aged status messages for a specific distribution point. In the same **Distribution Point Configuration Status** node, select a server. In the ribbon, select **Delete Aged Status Messages**. Then choose a timeframe for messages to delete: older than 30 days, older than 90 days, older than one year.

- Configure a site maintenance task to **Delete Aged Distribution Point Messages**. For more general information on tasks, see [Maintenance tasks](../../../../servers/manage/maintenance-tasks.md).
