## <a name="bkmk_support"></a> Changes to Support Center

<!--8693068-->

Support Center is now split into the following tools:

- **Support Center Client Data Collector**: Collects data from a device to view in the Support Center Viewer. This separate tool encompasses the existing Support Center action to [Collect selected data](../../../../support/support-center-ui-reference.md#collect-selected-data).

- **Support Center Client Tools**: The other Support Center troubleshooting functionality, except for **Collect selected data**.

The following tools are still a part of Support Center:

- **Support Center Viewer**
- **Support Center OneTrace**
- **Support Center Log File Viewer**

The Start menu group for Support Center now includes these five tools. There are no other changes to these tools in this release.
