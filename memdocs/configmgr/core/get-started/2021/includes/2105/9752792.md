## <a name="bkmk_powershell"></a> PowerShell release notes preview

<!--9752792-->

These release notes summarize changes to the Configuration Manager PowerShell cmdlets in technical preview version 2105.

For more information about PowerShell for Configuration Manager, see [Get started with Configuration Manager cmdlets](/powershell/sccm/overview).

### New cmdlets

#### Get-CMPersistentUserSettingsGroup

Use this cmdlet to get the list of site-wide settings that you've stored. These settings follow you on different devices.

For example, [Configuration Manager console notifications](../../../../servers/manage/admin-console-notifications.md) that are active or you've dismissed.

#### Remove-CMPersistentUserSettingsGroup

Use this cmdlet to reset your site-wide settings.

For example, you can restore [Configuration Manager console notifications](../../../../servers/manage/admin-console-notifications.md) that you've dismissed. After you run this cmdlet, and you restart the Configuration Manager console, you'll see all available notifications again.

### Modified cmdlets

#### Add-CMDeviceCollectionDirectMembershipRule

For more information, see [Add-CMDeviceCollectionDirectMembershipRule](/powershell/module/configurationmanager/Add-CMDeviceCollectionDirectMembershipRule).

**Bugs that were fixed**

Fixed an issue when trying to add thousands of devices as direct membership rules.

#### New-CMCloudManagementGateway

For more information, see [New-CMCloudManagementGateway](/powershell/module/configurationmanager/New-CMCloudManagementGateway).

**Breaking changes**

The **ServiceCertPassword** parameter is now required.
