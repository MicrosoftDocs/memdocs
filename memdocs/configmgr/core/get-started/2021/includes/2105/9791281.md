## <a name="bkmk_pkgurl"></a> Change to internet access requirements

<!--9791281-->

To simplify the [internet access requirements](../../../../plan-design/network/internet-endpoints.md#updates-and-servicing) for Configuration Manager updates and servicing, this technical preview branch release downloads from `configmgrbits.azureedge.net`. This endpoint is already required, so should already be allowed through internet filters. With this change, the existing internet endpoint for technical preview releases is no longer required: `cmupdatepackppe.blob.core.windows.net`.

> [!TIP]
> This change will also apply to the next current branch release. Since `configmgrbits.azureedge.net` is already a required endpoint, if you restrict internet access it shouldn't require any change. Before you install the next current branch release, confirm that the site system server that hosts the service connection point role can communicate with this internet endpoint. For more information, see [internet access requirements](../../../../plan-design/network/internet-endpoints.md#service-connection-point) for the service connection point.
