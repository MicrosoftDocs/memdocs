## <a name="bkmk_rbaviewer"></a> RBAViewer location change
<!--9573789-->
RBAViewer has moved from `<installdir>\tools\servertools\rbaviewer.exe`. It's now located in the Configuration Manager console directory. After you install the console, RBAViewer.exe will be in the same directory. The default location is `C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Endpoint Manager\AdminConsole\bin\rbaviewer.exe`.
