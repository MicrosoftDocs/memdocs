## <a name="bkmk_dex"></a> Tenant Attach: Historical inventory data in resource explorer
<!--9546584-->
Resource explorer can display a historical view of the device inventory in the Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center. Since this feature is still in preview, you'll need to access it from the **Admin center preview** option from the Configuration Manager console of the technical preview branch.

### Try it out!

Try to complete the tasks. Then send [Feedback](/configmgr/core/understand/find-help#product-feedback) with your thoughts on the feature.

1. In the Configuration Manager console, go to the **Assets and Compliance** workspace, and select the **Devices** node.

1. Select a device. In the **Device** group on the ribbon, select **Start**, and then select **Admin center preview**. This action opens the preview version of the Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center in the default browser.
1. From the admin center preview, select **Resource explorer**.
1. Select a class, then enter a custom date in the date time picker to get historical inventory data.
