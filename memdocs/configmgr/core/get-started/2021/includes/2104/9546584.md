## <a name="bkmk_dex"></a> Tenant attach: Historical inventory data in resource explorer
<!--9546584-->
Resource explorer can display a historical view of the device inventory in the Microsoft Intune admin center. Since this feature is still in preview, you'll need to access it from the **Admin center preview** option from the Configuration Manager console of the technical preview branch.
