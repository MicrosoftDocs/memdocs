## <a name="bkmk_offboard"></a> Tenant attach: Offboarding
<!--7043245-->

While we know customers get enormous value by enabling tenant attach, there are rare cases where you might need to offboard a hierarchy. For example, you may need to offboard following a disaster recovery scenario where the on-premises environment was removed. Follow the steps below to remove your Configuration Manager hierarchy from the Microsoft Intune admin center:

1. Navigate to [https://aka.ms/taoffboard](https://aka.ms/taoffboard). 
1. Select **Tenant administration** then **Connectors and tokens**.
1. Select **Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager (Preview)**.
1. Choose the name of the site you would like to offboard, then select **Delete**.
   - This option is only visible for 2104 technical preview sites.
