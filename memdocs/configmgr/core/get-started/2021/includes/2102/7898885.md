## <a name="bkmk_cmpivot"></a> Changes for CMPivot
<!--7898885-->
We've temporarily disabled the [Simplified CMPivot permissions requirements](../../technical-preview-2101.md#bkmk_permission) that were introduced in technical preview version 2101. If you removed the **Read** permission on **SMS Scripts** and the **default scope** permission, readd the permissions.
