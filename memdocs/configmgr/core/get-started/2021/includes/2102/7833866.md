## <a name="bkmk_sum"></a> Change default maximum run time for software updates
<!--7833866-->
Configuration Manager sets the following maximum run time for these categories of software updates:

- **Feature updates for Windows**: 120 minutes
- **Non-feature updates for Windows**: 60 minutes
- **Updates for Microsoft 365 Apps** (Office 365 updates): 60 minutes

All other software updates outside these categories, such as third-party updates, were given a maximum run time of 10 minutes. Starting in this technical preview, the default maximum run time for these updates is 60 minutes rather than 10 minutes.
