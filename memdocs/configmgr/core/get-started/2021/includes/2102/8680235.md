## <a name="bkmk_query"></a> Improvements to query preview
<!--8680235-->
You now have more options when using the [collection query preview](../../../2020/technical-preview-2008.md#collection-query-preview). The following improvements have been made to previewing collection queries:
- Limit the number of rows returned
   - Your limit can be between 1 to 10,000 rows. The default is 5000 rows. 
- Omit duplicate rows from the result set
  - If the **Omit duplicate rows** option isn't selected, the original query statement will be executed as is, even if the query contains the word **distinct**.
  - When the **Omit duplicate rows** option is selected, if the query already contains the word **distinct**, then the query runs as it is. When the query doesn't contain the word **distinct**, it's added to the query for the preview (mean override).
- Review statistics for the query preview such as number of rows returned and elapsed time.

> [!NOTE]
> - Elapsed times shown for the query preview may not be the same as actual execution of the target query.
> - **Query execution elapsed time** and **Displaying results elapsed time** shouldn't be added for a total elapsed time since these processes run in parallel.
