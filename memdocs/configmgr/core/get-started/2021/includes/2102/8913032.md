## <a name="bkmk_wsus"></a> TLS certificate pinning for devices scanning HTTPS-configured WSUS servers
<!--8913032-->
Further increase the security of HTTPS scans against WSUS by enforcing certificate pinning. To enable this behavior, add certificates for your WSUS servers to the new `WindowsServerUpdateServices` certificate store on your clients and enable certificate pinning through **Client Settings**. This setting ensures that your clients will only be able to communicate with WSUS when certificate pinning is successful. For more information, see [Scan changes and certificates add security for Windows devices using WSUS for updates - Microsoft Tech Community](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/windows-it-pro-blog/scan-changes-and-certificates-add-security-for-windows-devices/ba-p/2053668).

### Try it out!

Try to complete the tasks. Then send [Feedback](/configmgr/core/understand/find-help#product-feedback) with your thoughts on the feature.

### Prerequisites
- The WSUS server must be [enabled for TLS/SSL](../../../../../sum/get-started/software-update-point-ssl.md)
- The WSUS server's certificate must be in the client's `WindowsServerUpdateServices` certificate store
### Enable or disable TLS certificate pinning for devices scanning HTTPS-configured WSUS servers

1. From the Configuration Manager console, go to **Administration** > **Client Settings**.
1. Choose the **Default Client Settings** or a custom set of client settings, then select **Properties** from the ribbon.
1. Select the **Software Updates** tab in the **Client settings**
1. Choose one of the following options for the **Enforce TLS certificate pinning for Windows Update client for detecting updates** setting:
   - **No**: Don't enable enforcement of TLS certificate pinning for WSUS scanning
   - **Yes**: Enables enforcement of TLS certificate pinning for devices during WSUS scanning (default for this technical preview)
