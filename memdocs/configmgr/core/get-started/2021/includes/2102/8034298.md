## <a name="bkmk_reports"></a> Add a report as a favorite

<!--8034298-->

Configuration Manager ships with several hundred reports by default, and you may have added more to that list. Instead of continually searching for reports you commonly use, based on your [UserVoice feedback](https://configurationmanager.uservoice.com/forums/300492-ideas/suggestions/19042315-sccm-reports-option-to-create-favorites), you can now make a report a favorite. This action allows you to quickly access it from the new **Favorites** node.

The list of favorites is per user, not per site or hierarchy.

### Prerequisites for report favorites

The version of SQL Server Reporting Services on the site's reporting service point needs to be SQL Server 2017 or later.

> [!NOTE]
> All instances of SQL Server Reporting Services on the server need to be version 2017 or later.<!-- 9413706 -->

### Try it out!

Try to complete the tasks. Then send [Feedback](/configmgr/core/understand/find-help#product-feedback) with your thoughts on the feature.

1. In the Configuration Manager console, go to the **Monitoring** workspace. Expand the **Reporting** node, and select either the **Reports** or **Power BI Reports** node.

1. Select a report that you frequently use. Then in the ribbon, select **Add to Favorites**. The report's icon changes to a yellow star, which indicates that it's a favorite.

    > [!TIP]
    > You can select more than one report to add them all as favorites.

    To remove a report from the list of favorites, select it, and then select **Remove from Favorites**. When you remove a favorite, Configuration Manager doesn't delete the report.

1. Under the **Reporting** node, expand the new **Favorites** node. To view your list of favorites, select either the **Reports** or **Power BI Reports** node.

    > [!TIP]
    > You can directly connect to your favorite reports in your browser. For example, `https://rsp.contoso.com/Reports/favorites`.

    You can manage the reports the same from the list of favorites.
