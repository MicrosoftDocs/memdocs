## <a name="bkmk_bitlocker"></a> Improvements to BitLocker support via cloud management gateway

<!--8845996-->

In current branch version 2010, you can manage BitLocker policies and escrow recovery keys over a cloud management gateway (CMG). This support included a couple of limitations.

Starting in this technical preview release, BitLocker management policies over a CMG support the following capabilities:

- Recovery keys for removable drives

- TPM password hash, otherwise known as TPM owner authorization

For more information on BitLocker management over CMG, see [Deploy BitLocker management](../../../../../protect/deploy-use/bitlocker/recovery-service.md).
