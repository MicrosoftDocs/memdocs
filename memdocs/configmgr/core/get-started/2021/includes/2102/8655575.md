## <a name="bkmk_swctr"></a> Change foreground color for Software Center branding

<!--8655575-->

Software Center already provides various controls for you to customize the branding to support your organization's brand. For some customers, their brand color doesn't work well with the default white font color for a selected item. To better support these customers and improve accessibility, you can now configure a custom color for the foreground font.

When you customize [Software Center in client settings](../../../../clients/deploy/about-client-settings.md#software-center), there's a new option for **Foreground color for Software Center**.
