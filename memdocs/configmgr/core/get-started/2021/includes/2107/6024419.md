## <a name="bkmk_sum"></a> Tenant attach: Software updates information
<!--6024419-->
There's a new **Software updates** page for tenant attached devices. This page displays the status for software updates on a device. You can review which updates are successfully installed, failed, and are assigned but not yet installed. Using the timestamp for the update status assists with troubleshooting.

The following actions are available on the **Software update** page for a tenant attached device:

- **Search**: You can search using either a full or partial string in all columns except **Status time**.
- **Sort**: Sort a column by using the arrows after the column name. The default sort order is by **Status time**.
- **Refresh**: Retrieves updated information for the device from the Configuration Manager environment.
- **Export**: Exports all of the available data for the device to a `.csv` file.
