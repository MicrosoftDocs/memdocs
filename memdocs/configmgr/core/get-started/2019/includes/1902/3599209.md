## <a name="bkmk_health"></a> Improvements to the client health dashboard
<!--3599209-->

Based on your feedback, this version includes the following improvements to the [client health dashboard](../../technical-preview-1901.md#bkmk_health):

- Improved and streamlined layout
- Improved drill-through from tiles to actionable device lists
- Changes to increase performance for large environments and collections 

> [!Tip]  
> By default, the client health dashboard shows online clients, and clients active in the past three days. Therefore, you may see different numbers in this dashboard than in other historical sources of client health. For example, other nodes under Client Status, or reports in the client status category.
