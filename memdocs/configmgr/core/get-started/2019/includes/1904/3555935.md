## Community hub and GitHub
<!--3555935 & 3555936-->

The IT Admin community has developed a wealth of knowledge over the years. Rather than reinventing Scripts and Reports from scratch, we've built a **Configuration Manager Community Hub** where IT Admins can share with each other. By leveraging the work of others, you can save hours of work. The community hub fosters creativity by building on others work and having other people build on yours. GitHub already has industry-wide processes and tools built for sharing. Now, the community hub will leverage those tools directly in the Configuration Manager Console as foundational pieces for driving this new community.


### Prerequisites 

- A GitHub account

  - A GitHub account is only required to contribute and share content from the **My Hub** page.
  - If you don't wish to share, you can use contributions from others without having a GitHub account.
  - If you don't already have a GitHub account, you can create one before you join.

- The device running the Configuration Manager console used to access the hub needs the following:

   - Windows 10 build 17110 or higher
   - .Net Framework version 4.6 or higher

- To download reports, you'll need **Full Administrator** rights in Configuration Manager.
- To download reports, you need to turn on the option **Use Configuration Manager-generated certificates for HTTP site systems** at the site you're importing into. For more information, see [enhanced HTTP](../../../../plan-design/hierarchy/enhanced-http.md). This prerequisite is also needed in 1906 Technical Preview for updating hub objects.

     - Go to **Administration** > **Site Configuration** > **Sites**.
     - Select the site and choose **Properties** in the ribbon. 
     - On the General tab, select the option to **Use Configuration Manager-generated certificates for HTTP site systems**.

### Try it out!

1. After joining, you'll see your membership request is pending. Your account needs approval by the Configuration Manager Hub Content Curation team. Approvals are done once a day, so it may take up to 1 business day for your approval to be granted.
1. Once you're granted access, you'll get an email from GitHub. Open the link in the email to accept the invitation.

#### Contribute content

Once you've accepted the invitation, you can contribute content.

1. Go to **Community** > **Hub** > **My Hub**.
1. Click **Add an Item** to open the contribution wizard.
1. Specify the settings for the object:
   - **Type:** 
     - Report
     - PowerShell script for Run Scripts use
   - **Name:** Name of your object
   - **Description:** The description of the object you're contributing.
1. Click **Next** to submit the contribution.
1. Once the contribution is complete, you'll see the GitHub pull request (PR) link. The link is also emailed to you. You can paste the link into a browser to view the PR. Your PR will go though the standard GitHub merge process.
1. Click **Close** to exit the contribution wizard.
1. Once the PR has been completed and merged, the new item will show up on the community hub home page for others to see.
   - Currently, the audience is limited to other IT admins who are looking at the community hub in the Tech Preview builds.

#### Use the contributions of others

You don't need to sign into GitHub to use contributions others have made.

1. Go to the **Hub** node in the **Community** workspace.
1. Select an item to download.
1. You'll need appropriate permissions in your Configuration Manager site to download objects from the hub and import them into the site.
    - To import a script: **Create** permission for SMS_Scripts class.
    - To import a report: Full Administrator security role.
1. Downloaded reports are deployed to a report folder called **Hub** on the reporting services point. Downloaded scripts can be seen in the **Run Scripts** node.
