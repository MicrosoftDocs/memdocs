## <a name="bkmk_swctr"></a> Software Center infrastructure improvements

<!--3555950-->

This release includes the following infrastructure improvements to Software Center:

- Software Center now communicates with a management point for apps targeted to users as available. It doesn't use the application catalog anymore. This change makes it easier for you to remove the application catalog from the site.

- Previously, Software Center picked the first management point from the list of available servers. Starting in this release, it uses the same management point that the client uses. This change allows Software Center to use the same management point from the assigned primary site as the client.
