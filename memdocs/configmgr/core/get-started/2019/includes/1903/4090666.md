## <a name="bkmk_tsmedia"></a> Improvement to task sequence media creation

<!-- 4090666 -->

Based on your [UserVoice feedback](https://configurationmanager.uservoice.com/forums/300492-ideas/suggestions/20306074-add-ability-to-not-include-autorun-inf-when-buildi), when you create task sequence media, Configuration Manager doesn't add an autorun.inf file. This file is commonly blocked by antimalware products. For more information on the AutoRun feature of Windows, see [Creating an AutoRun-enabled CD-ROM Application](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/shell/autoplay).

You can still include the file if necessary for your scenario. When you create task sequence media in the Configuration Manager console, on the **Media Type** page of the wizard, select the option to **Include autorun.inf file on media**. By default, this option is disabled.
