## <a name="bkmk_req-updates"></a> Drill through required updates

<!--4224414-->

Based on your [UserVoice feedback](https://configurationmanager.uservoice.com/forums/300492-ideas/suggestions/19765630-show-machines-within-console-that-require-updates), you can now drill through compliance statistics to see which devices require a specific software update. To view the device list, you need permission to view updates and the collections the devices belong to.  

### Try it out!

Try to complete the tasks. Then send [Feedback](../../../../understand/find-help.md#product-feedback) with your thoughts on the feature.

1. Go to one of the following places in the Configuration Manager console:

   - **Software Library** > **Software Updates** > **All Software Updates**
   - **Software Library** > **Windows 10 Servicing** > **All Windows 10 Updates**
   - **Software Library** > **Office 365 Client Management** > **Office 365 Updates**

1. Select any update that is required by at least one device.
1. Look at the **Summary** tab and find the pie chart under  **Statistics**.
1. Select the **View Required** hyperlink next to the pie chart to drill down into the device list.
1. This action takes you to a temporary node under **Devices** where you can see the devices requiring the update. You can also take actions for the node such as creating a new collection from the list.
