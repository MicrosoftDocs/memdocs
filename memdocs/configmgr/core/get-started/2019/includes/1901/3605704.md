## <a name="bkmk_arm"></a> Use Azure Resource Manager for cloud services
<!--3605704-->

Starting in Configuration Manager current branch version 1810, the classic service deployment in Azure is deprecated for use in Configuration Manager. That version is the last to support creation of these Azure deployments. 

Existing deployments continue to work. Starting in this technical preview branch version, Azure Resource Manager is the only deployment mechanism for new instances of the cloud management gateway and cloud distribution point.

For more information, see the following articles:

- [Azure Resource Manager for the cloud management gateway](../../../../clients/manage/cmg/plan-cloud-management-gateway.md#azure-resource-manager)  
- [Azure Resource Manager for the cloud distribution point](../../../../plan-design/hierarchy/use-a-cloud-based-distribution-point.md#azure-resource-manager)
