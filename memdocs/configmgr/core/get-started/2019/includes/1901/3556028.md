## <a name="bkmk_posh"></a> Improvements to Run PowerShell Script task sequence step
<!--3556028-->
Based on your feedback, the **Run PowerShell Script** task sequence step now includes the following improvements:  

- Specify alternate user credentials with the option to **Run this step as the following account**.  

- Specify a **Time-out (minutes)**. This option ends the step if the script runs past the timeout value.  

- Specify a working directory with the **Start in** field.  

- On the **Options** tab, specify **Success codes**. Include other exit codes from the script that the step should evaluate as success.
