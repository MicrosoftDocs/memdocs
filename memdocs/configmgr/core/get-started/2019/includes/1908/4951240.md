## Improvements to console connections node
<!--4923997, 4951240 -->
In the **Console Connections** node, The **Last Console Heartbeat** column has replaced **Last Connected Time**. The **Last Console Heartbeat** column gives administrators more information for determining which console connections are currently active. When a Configuration Manager console is open, a check is made every 10 minutes. If the console is running in the foreground during the check, the **Last Console Heartbeat** column is updated.
