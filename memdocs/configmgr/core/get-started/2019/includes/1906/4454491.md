## <a name="bkmk_comgmt"></a> Co-management auto-enrollment using device token

<!--4454491-->

A new co-managed device now automatically enrolls to the Microsoft Intune service based on its Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) device token. It doesn't need to wait for a user to sign in to the device for auto-enrollment to start. This change helps to reduce the number of devices with the [enrollment status](../../../../../comanage/how-to-monitor.md#co-management-enrollment-status) *Pending user sign in*.

To support this behavior, clients need to be running Windows 10 version 1803 or later.

If the device token fails, it falls back to previous behavior with the user token. Look in the **ComanagementHandler.log** for the following entry:
`Enrolling device with RegisterDeviceWithManagementUsingAADDeviceCredentials`
