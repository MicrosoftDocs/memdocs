## RBAC on Folders

Based on your feedback, you can now set security scopes on folders. If you have access to an object in the folder but don't have access to the folder, you'll be unable to see the object. Similarly, if you have access to a folder but not an object within it, you won't see that object. 

### Try it out!

Try to complete the tasks. Then send [Feedback](../../../../understand/product-feedback.md) with your thoughts on the feature.

1. In the Configuration Manager console, right-click on a folder. For example, right-click a folder under the **Task Sequences** node.
1. Select **Folder** then **Set Security Scopes**.
1. Choose the security scopes you want to apply then click **OK**.

If you're already in the folder, you can also click on **Set Security Scopes** in the ribbon.
