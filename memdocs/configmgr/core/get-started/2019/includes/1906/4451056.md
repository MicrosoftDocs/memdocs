## <a name="bkmk_appcategory"></a> Filter applications deployed to devices

<!--4451056-->

Based on your [UserVoice feedback](https://configurationmanager.uservoice.com/forums/300492-ideas/suggestions/13252563-software-center-add-categories-to-maching-targett), user categories for device-targeted application deployments now show as filters in Software Center.

### Try it out!

Try to complete the tasks. Then send [Feedback](../../../../understand/find-help.md#product-feedback) with your thoughts on the feature.

1. Specify a **user category** for an application on the **Software Center** page of its properties. For more information, see [Manually specify application information](../../../../../apps/deploy-use/create-applications.md#bkmk_manual-app).

1. [Deploy the application](../../../../../apps/deploy-use/deploy-applications.md) to a machine as available.

Then open the app in Software Center and look at the available filters. For more information, see [Applications in Software Center](../../../../understand/software-center.md#applications).

### Known issue

<!-- 4726793 -->

If you *rename* an existing user category, it doesn't update on the client.

After adding a category to multiple apps, if you rename the category for one app, the renamed category only applies to that app. This change doesn't apply to other apps that reference the category. In Software Center, the renamed category shows as a new filter. The old category also shows as a filter.

To work around this issue, after you rename the category, deselect it on the app. Apply the changes, and then reselect the renamed category. This action revises the app, which applies the change.
