## <a name="bkmk_approve"></a> Improvements to app approvals

<!--4224910-->

This release includes the following improvements to app approvals:

> [!Note]  
> These improvements refer to the [optional feature](../../../../servers/manage/optional-features.md) **Approve application requests for users per device**.  

- If you approve an app request in the console, and then deny it, you can now approve it again. The app is reinstalled on the client after you approve it.  

- There's a new WMI method, **DeleteInstance** to remove an app approval request. This action doesn't uninstall the app on the device. If it's not already installed, the user can't install the app from Software Center. The version 1810 blog post below includes a PowerShell script sample that you can adjust for use with this API.  

- Call the **CreateApprovedRequest** API to create a pre-approved request for an app on a device. To prevent automatically installing the app on the client, set the **AutoInstall** parameter to `FALSE`. The user sees the app in Software Center, but it's not automatically installed.
