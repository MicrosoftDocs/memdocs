## <a name="bkmk_osd"></a> Improvements to OS deployment

<!--4512937,4224642-->

This release includes the following improvements to OS deployment:

- Based on your feedback, the [Disable BitLocker](../../../../../osd/understand/task-sequence-steps.md#BKMK_DisableBitLocker) task sequence step has a new restart counter. Use this option to specify the number of restarts to keep BitLocker disabled. Instead of adding multiple instances of this step, set a value between 1 (default) and 15. You can also set this behavior with the task sequence variable **OSDBitlockerRebootCount**.

    > [!Note]  
    > There is a known issue with the client-side functionality, so the task sequence only disables BitLocker for one restart.  

- Technical preview version 1904 included a feature to [Pre-cache driver packages and OS images](../../technical-preview-1904.md#bkmk_precache). This version improves upon that functionality by also adding packages. Specify the architecture and language of the package on its properties.
