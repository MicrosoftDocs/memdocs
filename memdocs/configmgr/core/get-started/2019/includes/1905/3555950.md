## <a name="bkmk_swctr"></a> Software Center infrastructure improvements

<!--3555950-->

Software Center communicates with a management point for apps targeted to users as available. It doesn't use the application catalog anymore. This change makes it easier for you to remove the application catalog from the site.

Now in this release, the management point checks the health of its user service every five minutes. It reports any issues via status messages for the SMS_MP_CONTROL_MANAGER site component.

> [!Important]  
> These iterative improvements to Software Center and the management point are to retire the application catalog roles. The Silverlight user experience isn't supported as of current branch version 1806. In the first current branch release after June 30, 2019, updated clients will automatically use the management point for user-available application deployments. You also won't be able to install new application catalog roles. Support ends for the application catalog roles with version 1910.
