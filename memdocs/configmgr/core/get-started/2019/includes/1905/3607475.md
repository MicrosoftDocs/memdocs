## <a name="bkmk_aadcollsync"></a> Synchronize collection membership results to Azure Active Directory groups

<!--3607475-->
You can now enable the synchronization of collection memberships to an Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) group. This synchronization allows you to use your existing on premises grouping rules in the cloud. You can synchronize device collections. Only Azure AD-joined devices are synchronized to Azure AD. 

The Azure AD synchronization happens every five minutes. It's a one-way process, from Configuration Manager to Azure AD. Changes made in Azure AD aren't reflected in Configuration Manager collections, but aren't overwritten by Configuration Manager. For example, if the Configuration Manager collection has two devices, and the Azure AD group has three different devices, after synchronization the Azure AD group has five devices.

### Prerequisites

- [Cloud Management](../../../../servers/deploy/configure/azure-services-wizard.md)
- [Azure Active Directory user discovery](../../../../servers/deploy/configure/about-discovery-methods.md#azureaddisc)

### Try it out!

Try to complete the tasks. Then send [Feedback](../../../../understand/find-help.md#product-feedback) with your thoughts on the feature.

#### Add group write permission to the app

1. Go to the **Azure Active Directory Tenants** node, select the web app for *Cloud Management*, and then select **Update Application Settings** in the ribbon.
1. Select **Yes** and you'll be given a sign in prompt for Azure.
1. Sign in with a user that has group write permission for Azure AD.
1. Once you successfully sign in, you'll see a dialog box that reads **Application settings successfully updated**.

#### Create collection Azure AD group mapping

1. Right-click on a collection and select the **Cloud Sync** tab.
1. Select **Add** to select Azure AD objects.
    - If you need to remove an Azure AD group, select it, then choose **Remove**.
1. Select your tenant then choose **Search**. You'll be prompted to sign in to Azure.
    - You can also type in a partial or full group name before clicking **Search**.
1. Once you sign in, select an *assigned* group from the populated search list, then select **OK**.
1. Select **Apply** to save the collection properties.

#### Limitations

Only one Azure AD tenant is supported. If you have more than one tenant, the results for collection membership synchronization to Azure AD are unpredictable.
