## <a name="bkmk_wvd"></a> Improvements to Windows Virtual Desktop support

<!--4737447-->

Configuration Manager current branch version 1906 introduced support for [Windows Virtual Desktop](../../../../plan-design/configs/supported-operating-systems-for-clients-and-devices.md#windows-virtual-desktop).

In the **Client Policy** group, configure the following setting: **Enable user policy for multiple user sessions**.
