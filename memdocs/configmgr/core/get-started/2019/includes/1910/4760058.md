## <a name="bkmk_appgrp"></a> Improvements to application groups

<!--4760058-->

Starting in current branch version 1906, you can create a group of applications to send to a device collection as a single deployment. This technical preview release improves upon this feature:

- Users can **Uninstall** the app group in Software Center.

- You can deploy an app group to a **user collection**.

For more general information, see [Create application groups](../../../../../apps/deploy-use/create-app-groups.md).
