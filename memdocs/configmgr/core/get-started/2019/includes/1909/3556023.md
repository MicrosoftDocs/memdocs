## <a name="bkmk_wifb"></a> Support for Windows Insider

<!--3556023-->

You can now service and update devices running Windows Insider Preview builds with Configuration Manager. This change means you can manage these devices without changing your normal processes or enabling Windows Update for Business. You can download feature updates and cumulative updates for Windows Insider Preview builds into Configuration Manager just like any other Windows 10 update or upgrade.

For more information, see the following articles:

- [Configuration Manager support for Windows Insider](../../../../plan-design/configs/support-for-windows-10.md#support-for-windows-insider)

- [Configure classifications and products for Windows Insider Program](../../../../../sum/get-started/configure-classifications-and-products.md#bkmk_WIfB)
