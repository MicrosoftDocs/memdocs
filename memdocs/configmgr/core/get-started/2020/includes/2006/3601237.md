## <a name="bkmk_portal"></a> Use the Company Portal app on co-managed devices

<!--CMADO-3601237,INADO-4297660-->

The Company Portal app is now the cross-platform app portal experience for the Microsoft Intune family of products. You can now use a preview version of the Company Portal app on co-managed devices. By configuring co-managed devices to also use the Company Portal, you can provide a consistent user experience on all devices.

This preview version of the Company Portal supports the following actions:

- Launch the Company Portal app on co-managed devices and sign in with Microsoft Entra single sign-on (SSO).
- View available and installed Configuration Manager apps in the Company Portal alongside Intune apps.
- Install available Configuration Manager apps from the Company Portal and receive installation status information.

The behavior of the Company Portal depends upon your co-management workload configuration:

| Workload | Setting | Behavior |
|----------|---------|----------|
| Client apps | **Configuration Manager** | You can see only Configuration Manager client apps |
| Client apps | **Pilot Intune** or **Intune** | You can see both Configuration Manager and Intune client apps |
| Office Click-to-run apps | **Configuration Manager** | You can see only Configuration Manager Office click-to-run apps |
| Office Click-to-run apps | **Pilot Intune** or **Intune** | You can see only Intune Office click-to-run apps |

For more information, see [How to switch Configuration Manager workloads to Intune](../../../../../comanage/how-to-switch-workloads.md).
