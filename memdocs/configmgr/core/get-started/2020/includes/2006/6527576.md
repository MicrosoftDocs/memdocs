## <a name="bkmk_wvd"></a> Improved support for Windows Virtual Desktop

<!--6527576-->

The **Windows 10 Enterprise multi-session** platform is available in the list of supported OS versions on objects with requirement rules or applicability lists.

For more information on Configuration Manager's support for Windows Virtual Desktop, see [Supported OS versions for clients and devices](../../../../plan-design/configs/supported-operating-systems-for-clients-and-devices.md#windows-virtual-desktop).

> [!NOTE]
> If you previously selected the top-level **Windows 10** platform, this action automatically selected all child platforms. This new platform isn't automatically selected. If you want to add **Windows 10 Enterprise multi-session**, manually select it in the list.
