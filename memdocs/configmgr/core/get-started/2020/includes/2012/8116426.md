## <a name="bkmk_hubext"></a> Get console extensions from the Community hub

<!--8116426-->

The [Community hub](../../../../servers/manage/community-hub.md) now supports sharing extensions to the Configuration Manager console. When you get an extension from the hub, it's available in a new **Console extensions** node in the console. Getting an extension from the hub doesn't make it immediately available. First, an administrator has to approve the extension for the site. Then console users can install the extension to their local console.

After you approve an extension, when you open the console, you'll see a [console notification](../../../../servers/manage/community-hub.md#bkmk_webview2). From the notification, you can start the extension installer. After the installer completes, the console restarts automatically, and then you can use the extension.

### Console extension to show all status messages for a task sequence deployment

With this release, the Community hub includes one extension to help you test and use this feature: `Show all status messages for a task sequence deployment`. This extension is based on your [UserVoice feedback](https://configurationmanager.uservoice.com/forums/300492-ideas/suggestions/11605476-status-messages-in-the-sccm-console). When you install this extension, it adds a right-click action to task sequence deployments to **Show all status messages**.

To share a console extension with the community, use the same process to [Contribute content](../../../../servers/manage/community-hub-contribute.md).

### Try it out!

Try to complete the tasks. Then send [Feedback](../../../../understand/product-feedback.md) with your thoughts on the feature.
