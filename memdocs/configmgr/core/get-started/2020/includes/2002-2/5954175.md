## <a name="bkmk_arm"></a> Improvements to support for ARM64 devices

<!--5954175-->

This release improves upon the support for devices with the ARM64 processor. The **All Windows 10 (ARM64)** platform is now available in the list of supported OS versions on the following objects:

- Configuration item supported platforms
- Application deployment type requirements
- Package program requirements
- Task sequence advanced properties

> [!NOTE]
> If you previously selected the top-level **Windows 10** platform, this action automatically selected both **All Windows 10 (64-bit)** and **All Windows 10 (32-bit)**. This new platform isn't automatically selected. If you want to add **All Windows 10 (ARM64)**, manually select it in the list.

For more information on Configuration Manager's support for ARM64 devices, see [Windows 10 on ARM64](../../../../plan-design/configs/support-for-windows-10.md#bkmk_arm64).
