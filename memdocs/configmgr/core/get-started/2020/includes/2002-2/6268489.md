## <a name="bkmk_insight"></a> Management insight rules for proper HTTPS configuration

<!--6268489-->

This release includes additional [management insight](../../../../servers/manage/management-insights.md) rules to help you configure your site for adding secure HTTPS communication:

- **Sites that don't have proper HTTPS configuration**: This rule lists sites in your hierarchy that are not properly configured for HTTPS. This configuration prevents the site from [synchronizing collection membership results to Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) groups](../../../../clients/manage/collections/create-collections.md#bkmk_aadcollsync). It may cause Azure AD sync to not upload all devices. Management of these clients may not function properly.

- **Devices not uploaded to Azure AD**: This rule lists devices that aren't uploaded to Azure AD because the site isn't properly configured for HTTPS.

For either rule, configure [Enhanced HTTP](../../../../plan-design/hierarchy/enhanced-http.md), or enable at least one management point for HTTPS. These rules will not appear if you have previously configured the site for HTTPS communication.
