## <a name="bkmk_extend"></a> Improvements to extend and migrate on-premises site to Microsoft Azure
<!--6307931-->
[Extend and migrate on-premises site to Microsoft Azure](../../../../support/azure-migration-tool.md) now supports provisioning multiple site system roles on a single Azure virtual machine. You can add site system roles after the initial Azure virtual machine deployment has completed. To add a new role to an existing virtual machine, do the following steps:
1. On the **Deployments in Azure** tab, click on a virtual machine deployment that has a **Completed** status.
1. Click the **Create new** button to add an additional role to the virtual machine.
