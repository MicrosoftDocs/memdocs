## <a name="bkmk_apps"></a> Enhancements to applications in Microsoft Intune admin center
<!--7979972, 8227649-->

We've made improvements to [applications for tenant attached devices](../../../../../tenant-attach/applications.md). Administrators can now do the following actions for applications in the Microsoft Intune admin center:

- **Uninstall** an application
- **Repair** installation of an application
- **Re-evaluate** the application installation status
- **Reinstall** an application has replaced **Retry installation**

### Known issues with apps in Microsoft Intune admin center
<!--8699417-->
In this technical preview, if you see an error notification when you install, uninstall, reevaluate, or repair an app, use the following workaround. Open SQL Server Management Studio, select the primary site database, and run the following SQL script:

```sql
DECLARE @view nvarchar(max) = OBJECT_DEFINITION(OBJECT_ID('[dbo].[vSMS_CombinedDeviceResources]'));
IF (@view IS NULL) print 'Object not found, select primary site database and re-run script'
ELSE BEGIN
       SET @view = REPLACE(REPLACE(@view, 'ck.ApprovalStatus as IsApproved', '(CASE WHEN ck.ApprovalStatus = 2 OR ck.ApprovalStatus = 3 THEN 1 ELSE ck.ApprovalStatus END) as IsApproved'), 'CREATE VIEW', 'ALTER VIEW')
       EXEC sp_executesql @view
END
```
