## <a name="bkmk_expire"></a> Additional options when creating app registrations in Azure Active Directory
<!--7153654-->
You can now specify **Never** for the expiration of a secret key when creating Azure Active Directory app registrations. For more information about creating app registrations, see [Configure Azure Services](../../../../servers/deploy/configure/azure-services-wizard.md#azure-app-properties).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Choosing **Never** as an option for secret key expiry carries security risk since a secret that's compromised and never expires can become a point of entry into your environment.
