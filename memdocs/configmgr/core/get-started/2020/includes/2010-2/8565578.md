## <a name="bkmk_scp"></a> Validate internet access for the service connection point

<!--8565578-->

If you use Desktop Analytics or tenant attach, the service connection point now checks important internet endpoints. These checks help make sure that the cloud-connected services are available. It also helps you troubleshoot issues by quickly determining if network connectivity is a problem.

For more details, review the **EndpointConnectivityCheckWorker.log** file on the service connection point.

A failure isn't always determined by the HTTP status code, but if there's network connectivity to an endpoint. The following scenarios can cause a check to fail:

- Network connection timeout
- SSL/TLS failure
- Unexpected status code:

  | Status code | Description | Possible reason |
  |---------|---------|---------|
  | 407 | Proxy authentication required | May indicate a proxy issue |
  | 408 | Request timeout | May indicate a proxy issue |
  | 426 | Upgrade required | May indicate a TLS misconfiguration |
  | 451 | Unavailable for legal reasons | May indicate a proxy issue |
  | 502 | Bad gateway | May indicate a proxy issue |
  | 511 | Network authentication required | May indicate a proxy issue |
  | 598 | Network read timeout error | Not RFC compliant, but used by some proxy servers to indicate a network timeout |
  | 599 | Network connection timeout error | Not RFC compliant, but used by some proxy servers to indicate a network timeout |

There are also the following status messages for the **SMS_SERVICE_CONNECTOR** component:

| Message ID | Severity | Notes |
|---------|---------|---------|
| 11410 | Informational | All checks are successful |
| 11411 | Warning | One or more non-critical failures occurred |
| 11412 | Error | One or more critical failures occurred |

For more information on required internet endpoints, see [Internet access requirements](../../../../plan-design/network/internet-endpoints.md).
