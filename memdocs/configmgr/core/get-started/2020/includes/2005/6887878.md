## <a name="bkmk_content"></a> Improvements to the content library cleanup tool

<!--6887878-->

If you manually delete content from a distribution point without removing the content in the console, an orphan record can exist in WMI. This behavior can eventually lead to a warning status on the distribution point. To mitigate the issue, you had to manually remove the orphaned entries from WMI. Making a mistake during this process could cause more severe issues with the server.

The content library cleanup tool in delete mode could remove orphaned files from the content library. It can now also remove orphaned content records from the WMI provider on a distribution point. Run the tool with the `/delete` parameter for both use cases.

For more information, see the [Content library cleanup tool](../../../../plan-design/hierarchy/content-library-cleanup-tool.md).
