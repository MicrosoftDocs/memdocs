## <a name="bkmk_availapp"></a> Azure AD authentication in Software Center

<!-- 6935376 -->

This release fixes an issue with Software Center and Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) authentication. Software Center would use Windows authentication to get the list of user available apps via the cloud management gateway (CMG), which would fail. It now uses Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) identity for devices joined to Azure AD. These devices can be cloud-joined or hybrid-joined.
