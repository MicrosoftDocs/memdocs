## <a name="bkmk_wake"></a> Wake up a device from the central administration site

<!--6030715-->

From the central administration site (CAS), in the **Devices** or **Device Collections** node, you can now use the client notification action to **Wake Up** devices. This action was previously only available from a primary site. For more information, see [How to configure Wake on LAN](../../../../clients/deploy/configure-wake-on-lan.md#bkmk_wol-1810).

When you start this action from the CAS, it sends a fast message to the primary site to which the client is assigned. The primary site then processes the action as normal. Once the primary site receives an updated status from the client, it reports that status to the CAS.

> [!NOTE]
> You can't complete this scenario with this release due to the technical preview branch limit of a single primary site. Consider the scenario, and try the existing action from the primary site. Then send **Feedback** from the **Home** tab of the ribbon, regarding the capabilities of this action.
