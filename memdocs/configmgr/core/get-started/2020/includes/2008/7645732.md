## <a name="bkmk_tssize"></a> See task sequence size in the console

<!--7645732-->

This release continues to iterate on changes in technical preview [version 2004](../../technical-preview-2004.md#bkmk_osdmi) and [version 2007](../../technical-preview-2007.md#bkmk_tspol) to help you manage the size of task sequences. When you view the list of task sequences in the Configuration Manager console, add the **Size (KB)** column. Use this column to identify large task sequences that can cause problems.

> [!NOTE]
> This value is updated when the task sequence is saved. After upgrade the value will show as 0KB until the task sequence is edited and changes are saved.
