## <a name="bkmk_logs"></a> Delete Aged Collected Diagnostic Files task
<!--6503308-->
You now have a new [maintenance task](../../../../servers/manage/maintenance-tasks.md#set-up-maintenance-tasks) available for cleaning up [collected diagnostic files](../../../../clients/manage/client-notification.md#client-diagnostics). **Delete Aged Collected Diagnostic Files** uses a default value of 14 days when looking for diagnostic files to clean up and doesn't affect regular collected files. The new maintenance task is enabled by default.
