## <a name="bkmk_status"></a> Shortcuts to status messages

<!--8232705-->

Based on your feedback, you now have an easier way to view status messages for the following objects:

- Devices
- Users
- Content
- Deployments
  - Monitoring workspace
    - Phased deployments (select **Show Deployments** from the Phased Deployments node)
  - Deployments tab in the details pane for:
    - Packages
    - Task sequences

Select one of these objects in the Configuration Manager console, and then select **Show Status Messages** from the ribbon. Set the viewing period, and then the status message viewer opens. The viewer filters the results to the object you selected.

Your user account needs at least **Read** permission to these objects.
