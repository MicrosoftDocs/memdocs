## <a name="bkmk_osd"></a> Improvements to task sequence performance for power plans

<!--7721999 & 8177793-->

Starting in Configuration Manager version 1910, to improve the overall speed of the task sequence, you can activate the Windows power plan for **High Performance**. Starting in this technical preview release, you can now use this option on devices with [modern standby](/windows-hardware/design/device-experiences/modern-standby) and other devices that don't have that default power plan. Now when you use this task sequence option, it creates a temporary power plan that's similar to the default for **High Performance**. After the task sequence completes, it reverts to the original power plan, and deletes the temporary plan.

For more information on this option, see [Task sequence performance](../../../../../osd/deploy-use/task-sequence-performance.md).
