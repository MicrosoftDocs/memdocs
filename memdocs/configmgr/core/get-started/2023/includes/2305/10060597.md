## <a name="bkmk_Notification"></a> Enhancing security for External service notifications URL 

<!-- This is an include file and is included in a page which has an H1 heading -->

<!--10060597-->
This feature avoids the risk of directing the subscription logic to an untrusted URL, resulting in information leakage. The upgrade will prevent information from being sent to an HTTPS URL with an untrusted certificate. This ensures that the data is protected by a trusted SSL certificate. For a secure connection, we recommend using SSL certificates from trusted Certification Authorities. This security feature will only allow connections to URL’s that have trusted certificates for enhanced security.
