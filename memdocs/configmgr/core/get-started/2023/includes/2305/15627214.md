## <a name="bkmk_CMGC"></a> CMG creation using third PartyApp via Console

<!--15627214-->
We have deprecated the use of first party app for the creation of CMG. Now, CMG uses a third party server app to get bearer tokens. 
For CMG creation, users can select tenant and the app name using the Microsoft Entra tenant name.  After selecting tenant and app name the sign-in button appears. Existing Customers, must update their server app as current version, doesn't have the Redirect to- "http://localhost"

To update the server app, you can navigate to Microsoft Entra tenants node --> select the tenant --> select the server app --> click on "update application settings".
