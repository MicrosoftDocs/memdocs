## Dark theme extended to one customer voice(OCV) wizard
<!-- This is an include file and is included in a page which has an H1 heading -->

<!--17433655-->
The Configuration Manager console now extends the dark theme for the one customer voice(OCV) wizards. All 'Send a smile' and 'Send a frown' wizards will adhere to dark theme starting in Technical Preview 2303. This is part of the ongoing effort to make dark theme and overall admin console experience better.

To use the theme, select the arrow from the top left of the ribbon, then choose **Switch console theme**. Select **Switch console theme** again to return to the light theme.

### Known issue

Console restart is required on doing the theme switch, as the node navigation pane might not properly render when you move to a new workspace.
