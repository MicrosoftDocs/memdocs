## <a name="bkmk_CMGSecurity"></a>Enhanced Security for CMG


CMG Setup now uses managed identities and third party **Server App** to interact with CMG's Azure storage account, instead of storage account keys.
 - Hence storage account key access is disabled for new CMG setup.

 - For sessions upgrading from earlier versions to 2411 tp, the **CMG Enhance Security** button is shown as enabled.

 - When the enhanced security option is selected, the VMSS OS Auto Upgrade feature is also activated. An extra panel appears, prompting the admin to provide maintenance window details. Azure uses this information to schedule upgrades whenever new OS images become available.

### CMG Entra Application secret key renewal

The 'Renew Secret Key' feature now opens a dialog with four options for the validity period. This update also prevents applications older than 800 days (approximately two years) from renewing their secret keys. The same options are available when creating a new app.
