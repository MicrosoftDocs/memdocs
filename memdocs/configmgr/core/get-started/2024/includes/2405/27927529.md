## <a name="bkmk_Sqlepa"></a> Configuration Manager now supports SQL Extended Protection for Authentication

<!--24501008-->

Configuration Manager now supports SQL Extended Protection for Authentication. It's a security feature that enhances protection against MITM attacks, making SQL Server more secure when connections are made using Extended Protection. These enhancements collectively reduce the risk of unauthorized access and protect sensitive data managed by the SQL Server Database Engine. 

For more information, see [Connect to the Database Engine Using Extended Protection](/sql/database-engine/configure-windows/connect-to-the-database-engine-using-extended-protection)
