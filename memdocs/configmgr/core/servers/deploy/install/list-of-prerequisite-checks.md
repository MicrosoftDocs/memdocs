<!--SCCMDocs-pr issue 2814-->

*Applies to: Primary site*

You may see this warning if you have many application deployments and at least one of them requires approval.

You have two options:

- Ignore the warning and continue with the update. This action causes higher processing on the site server during the update as it processes the policies. You may also see more processor load on the management point after the update.

- Revise one of the applications that has no requirements or a specific OS requirement. Pre-process some of the load on the site server at that time. Review **objreplmgr.log**, and then monitor the processor on the management point. After the processing is complete, update the site. There will still be some additional processing after the update, but less than if you ignore the warning with the first option.

### Pending system restart on the remote SQL Server

*Applies to: remote SQL Server*

Before you run setup, another program requires the server to be restarted.

To see if the computer is in a pending restart state, it checks the following registry locations:<!--SCCMDocs-pr issue 3377-->

- `HKLM:Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Component Based Servicing\RebootPending`

- `HKLM:SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\WindowsUpdate\Auto Update\RebootRequired`

- `HKLM:SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager, PendingFileRenameOperations`

- `HKLM:Software\Microsoft\ServerManager, CurrentRebootAttempts`

### PowerShell 2.0 on site server

*Applies to: Primary site with Exchange connector*

Windows PowerShell 2.0 or a later version is installed on the site server for the Configuration Manager Exchange Connector.

### Recommended version of Microsoft .NET Framework

_Applies to: CAS, primary site, secondary site_

<!--10402814-->
This rule checks if the .NET Framework is at least version 4.8. You'll see this warning if the system has at least version 4.6.2, but less than version 4.8.

Starting in version 2107, Configuration Manager requires Microsoft .NET Framework version 4.6.2 for site servers, specific site systems, clients, and the console. If possible in your environment, .NET version 4.8 is recommended. A later version of Configuration Manager will require .NET version 4.8. Before you run setup to install or update the site, first update .NET and restart the system. For more information, [Site and site system prerequisites](../../../plan-design/configs/site-and-site-system-prerequisites.md).

### Remote connection to WMI on secondary site

*Applies to: Secondary site*

Setup can establish a remote connection to WMI on the secondary site server.

### Required version of Microsoft .NET Framework (warning)

_Applies to: CAS, primary site, secondary site_

<!--10402814-->
In version 2107, this rule checks if the .NET Framework is at least version 4.6.2. You'll see this warning if the system has less than version 4.6.2.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Starting in version 2111, if this check fails, it returns an [error](#required-version-of-microsoft-net-framework-error) instead of a warning. To determine the systems that need to be updated, review the **ConfigMgrPrereq.log** found on the system drive of the computer. <!--10977707-->

Configuration Manager requires Microsoft .NET Framework version 4.6.2 for site servers, specific site systems, clients, and the console. If possible in your environment, .NET version 4.8 is recommended. A later version of Configuration Manager will require .NET version 4.8. Before you run setup to install or update the site, first update .NET and restart the system. For more information, [Site and site system prerequisites](../../../plan-design/configs/site-and-site-system-prerequisites.md).



### Schema extensions

*Applies to: Central administration site, primary site*

The Active Directory schema has been extended. If it's extended, the version of the schema extensions that were used.

Configuration Manager doesn't require Active Directory schema extensions for site server installation. Microsoft recommends them for the full use of all Configuration Manager features. For more information about the advantages of extending the schema, see [Prepare Active Directory for site publishing](../../../plan-design/network/extend-the-active-directory-schema.md).

### Share name in package

*Applies to: Central administration site, primary site*

Packages don't have invalid characters in the share name, such as `#`.

### Site system to SQL Server communication

*Applies to: Secondary site, management point*

The account that you configured to run the SQL Server service for the site database instance has a valid service principal name (SPN) in Active Directory Domain Services. Register a valid SPN in Active Directory to support Kerberos authentication.

### SQL Server 2012 lifecycle

<!--10092858-->

_Applies to: CAS, primary site, secondary site_

This rule warns for the presence of SQL Server 2012. The [support lifecycle](/lifecycle/products/microsoft-sql-server-2012) for SQL Server 2012 ends on July 12, 2022. Plan to upgrade database servers in your environment, including SQL Server Express at secondary sites.

For more information, see [Removed and deprecated for site servers: SQL Server](../../../plan-design/changes/deprecated/removed-and-deprecated-server.md#sql-server).

### <a name="bkmk_changetracking"></a> SQL Server change tracking cleanup

*Applies to: Site database server*

Check if the site database has a backlog of SQL Server change tracking data.<!--SCCMDocs-pr issue 3023-->

Manually verify this check by running a diagnostic stored procedure in the site database. First, create a [diagnostic connection](/sql/database-engine/configure-windows/diagnostic-connection-for-database-administrators) to your site database. The easiest method is to use SQL Server Management Studio's Database Engine Query Editor, and connect to `admin:<instance name>`.

In a dedicated administrator connection query window, run the following commands:

```SQL
USE <ConfigMgr database name>
EXEC spDiagChangeTracking
```

Depending upon the size of your database and the backlog size, this stored procedure could run in a few minutes or several hours. When the query completes, you see two sections of data related to the backlog. First look at **CT_Days_Old**. This value tells you the age (days) of the oldest entry in your syscommittab table. It should be five days, which is the Configuration Manager default value. Don't change this default value. At times of heavy data processing or replication, the oldest entry in syscommittab could be over five days. If this value is above seven days, run a manual cleanup of change tracking data.

To clean up the change tracking data, run the following command in the dedicated administration connection:

```SQL
USE <ConfigMgr database name>
EXEC spDiagChangeTracking @CleanupChangeTracking = 1
```

This command starts a cleanup of syscommittab and all of the associated side tables. It can run in several minutes or several hours. To monitor its progress, query the **vLogs** view. To see the current progress, run the following query:

```SQL
SELECT * FROM vLogs WHERE ProcedureName = 'spDiagChangeTracking'
```

### SQL Server Express version on secondary site

_Applies to: Secondary site_

<!-- 9421748 -->

Starting in version 2103, if you have a secondary site that uses SQL Server Express edition, this check warns if the version is earlier than SQL Server 2016 with service pack 2 (13.0.5026.0). If Configuration Manager didn't install SQL Server Express, then setup skips this check. Setup looks for the presence of the CONFIGMGRSEC instance.

Microsoft recommends that you keep SQL Server Express up to date. For more information, see [Security for site administration](../../../plan-design/hierarchy/security-and-privacy-for-site-administration.md#update-sql-server-express-at-secondary-sites).

### SQL Server Native Client
<!--SCCMDocs-pr issue 3094-->

When you install a new site, Configuration Manager automatically installs SQL Server Native Client as a redistributable component. After the site is installed, Configuration Manager doesn't upgrade SQL Server Native Client. Updating the SQL Server Native Client may require a restart, which can impact the site install process.

This check makes sure the site server has a supported version of the SQL Server Native Client. The prerequisite check doesn't verify the version of the SQL Server Native Client on remote site systems.

The minimum version is SQL Server 2012 SP4 (`11.*.7001.0`). This SQL Server Native Client version supports TLS 1.2. For more information, see the following articles:

- [TLS 1.2 support for Microsoft SQL Server](https://support.microsoft.com/topic/kb3135244-tls-1-2-support-for-microsoft-sql-server-e4472ef8-90a9-13c1-e4d8-44aad198cdbe)

- [How to enable TLS 1.2 for Configuration Manager](../../../plan-design/security/enable-tls-1-2.md)

Configuration Manager uses SQL Server Native Client on the following site system roles:<!-- SCCMDocs issue 1150 -->

- Site database server
- Site server: central administration site, primary site, or secondary site
- Management point
- Device management point
- State migration point
- SMS Provider
- Software update point
- Multicast-enabled distribution point
- Asset Intelligence update service point
- Reporting services point
- Enrollment point
- Endpoint Protection point
- Service connection point
- Certificate registration point
- Data warehouse service point
