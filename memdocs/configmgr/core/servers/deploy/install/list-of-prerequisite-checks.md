<!--SCCMDocs-pr issue 2814-->

*Applies to: Primary site*

Starting in version 1806, if you're updating from version 1706 or later, you may see this warning if you have many application deployments and at least one of them requires approval.

You have two options:  

- Ignore the warning and continue with the update. This action causes higher processing on the site server during the update as it processes the policies. You may also see more processor load on the management point after the update.  

- Revise one of the applications that has no requirements or a specific OS requirement. Pre-process some of the load on the site server at that time. Review **objreplmgr.log**, and then monitor the processor on the management point. After the processing is complete, update the site. There will still be some additional processing after the update, but less than if you ignore the warning with the first option.  

### Pending system restart on the remote SQL Server

*Applies to: Version 1902 and later, remote SQL Server*

Before you run setup, another program requires the server to be restarted.

To see if the computer is in a pending restart state, it checks the following registry locations:<!--SCCMDocs-pr issue 3377-->

Configuration Manager doesn't require Active Directory schema extensions for site server installation. Microsoft recommends them for the full use of all Configuration Manager features. For more information about the advantages of extending the schema, see [Prepare Active Directory for site publishing](../../../plan-design/network/extend-the-active-directory-schema.md).

### Share name in package

*Applies to: Central administration site, primary site*

Packages don't have invalid characters in the share name, such as `#`.

### Site system to SQL Server communication

*Applies to: Secondary site, management point*

The account that you configured to run the SQL Server service for the site database instance has a valid service principal name (SPN) in Active Directory Domain Services. Register a valid SPN in Active Directory to support Kerberos authentication.

### <a name="bkmk_changetracking"></a> SQL Server change tracking cleanup

*Applies to: Site database server*

Starting in version 1810, check if the site database has a backlog of SQL change tracking data.<!--SCCMDocs-pr issue 3023-->  

Manually verify this check by running a diagnostic stored procedure in the site database. First, create a [diagnostic connection](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/database-engine/configure-windows/diagnostic-connection-for-database-administrators?view=sql-server-2017) to your site database. The easiest method is to use SQL Server Management Studio's Database Engine Query Editor, and connect to `admin:<instance name>`.

In a dedicated administrator connection query window, run the following commands:

```SQL
USE <ConfigMgr database name>
EXEC spDiagChangeTracking
```

Depending upon the size of your database and the backlog size, this stored procedure could run in a few minutes or several hours. When the query completes, you see two sections of data related to the backlog. First look at **CT_Days_Old**. This value tells you the age (days) of the oldest entry in your syscommittab table. It should be five days, which is the Configuration Manager default value. Don't change this default value. At times of heavy data processing or replication, the oldest entry in syscommittab could be over five days. If this value is above seven days, run a manual cleanup of change tracking data.  

To clean up the change tracking data, run the following command in the dedicated administration connection:

```SQL
USE <ConfigMgr database name>
EXEC spDiagChangeTracking @CleanupChangeTracking = 1
```

This command starts a cleanup of syscommittab and all of the associated side tables. It can run in several minutes or several hours. To monitor its progress, query the **vLogs** view. To see the current progress, run the following query:

```SQL
SELECT * FROM vLogs WHERE ProcedureName = 'spDiagChangeTracking'
```

### SQL Server Native Client

<!--SCCMDocs-pr issue 3094-->

When you install a new site, Configuration Manager automatically installs SQL Server Native Client as a redistributable component. After the site is installed, Configuration Manager doesn't upgrade SQL Server Native Client. Updating the SQL Server Native Client may require a restart, which can impact the site install process.

This check makes sure the site has a supported version of the SQL Native Client. Starting in version 1810, the minimum version is SQL 2012 SP4 (`11.*.7001.0`).

This SQL Native Client version supports TLS 1.2. For more information, see the following articles:

- [TLS 1.2 support for Microsoft SQL Server](https://support.microsoft.com/help/3135244/tls-1-2-support-for-microsoft-sql-server)  

- [How to enable TLS 1.2 for Configuration Manager](../../../plan-design/security/enable-tls-1-2.md)  

Configuration Manager uses SQL Server Native Client on the following site system roles:<!-- SCCMDocs issue 1150 -->

- Site database server
- Site server: central administration site, primary site, or secondary site
- Management point
- Device management point
- State migration point
- SMS Provider
- Software update point
- Multicast-enabled distribution point
- Asset Intelligence update service point
- Reporting services point
- Application catalog web service
- Enrollment point
- Endpoint Protection point
- Service connection point
- Certificate registration point
- Data warehouse service point
