# Use the Setup Wizard to install Configuration Manager sites

*Applies to: Configuration Manager (current branch)*

To install a new Configuration Manager site by using a guided user interface, use the Configuration Manager Setup Wizard (setup.exe). The wizard supports installing a primary site or central administration site. You also use the wizard to [upgrade an evaluation installation](upgrade-an-evaluation-install-to-a-full-install.md) of Configuration Manager to a fully licensed installation. When you don't want to use the wizard, you can instead use an [installation script](use-a-command-line-to-install-sites.md) and run an unattended command-line installation.

Install a secondary site from within the Configuration Manager console. Secondary sites don't support a scripted command-line installation.

## <a name="bkmk_primary"></a> Install a central administration or primary site

Use the following procedure to install a central administration site or a primary site. Also use it to upgrade an evaluation site to a fully licensed Configuration Manager site.

Before starting the site installation, be familiar with the details in the following articles:

- [Prepare to install sites](prepare-to-install-sites.md)
- [Prerequisites for installing sites](prerequisites-for-installing-sites.md)

If you're installing a central administration site as part of a site expansion scenario, review [Expanding a stand-alone primary site](use-the-setup-wizard-to-install-sites.md#bkmk_expand) before using the following procedure.

### <a name="bkmk_installpri"></a> Process to install a primary or central administration site

1. On the computer where you want to install the site, run `<InstallationMedia>\SMSSETUP\BIN\X64\Setup.exe` to start the **Configuration Manager Setup Wizard**.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > When you install a central administration site to expand on a stand-alone primary site, or install a new child primary site in an existing hierarchy, use installation media (source files) that match the version of the existing site or sites. If you've installed in-console updates that have changed the version of the previously installed sites, don't use the original installation media. Instead, use source files from the [CD.Latest folder](../../manage/the-cd.latest-folder.md) of an updated site. Configuration Manager requires you to use source files that match the version of the existing site that your new site will connect to.  

2. On the **Before You Begin** page, choose **Next**.  

3. On the **Getting Started** page, select the type of site that you want to install:  

    - **Central administration site**, as the first site of a new hierarchy, or when expanding a stand-alone primary site:  

        Select **Install a Configuration Manager central administration site**.  

        During a later step of this procedure, you're offered the choice to install a central administration site as the first site of a new hierarchy, or to install a central administration site to expand on a stand-alone primary site.  

    - **Primary site**, as a stand-alone primary site that is the first site of a new hierarchy, or as a child primary:  

        Select **Install a Configuration Manager primary site**.  

        > [!TIP]  
        > Typically, you only select the option **Use typical installation options for a stand-alone primary site** when you want to install a stand-alone primary site in a test environment. When you select this option, setup does the following actions:  
        >
        > - Automatically configures the site as a stand-alone primary site.  
        > - Uses a default installation path.  
        > - Uses a local installation of the default instance of SQL Server for the site database.  
        > - Installs a management point and a distribution point on the site server computer.  
        > - Configures the site with English and the display language of the OS on the primary site server if it matches one of the languages that Configuration Manager supports.  

4. On the **Product Key** page:  

    - Choose whether to install Configuration Manager as an evaluation edition or a licensed edition.  

        - If you select a licensed edition, enter your product key, and choose **Next**.  

        - If you select an evaluation edition, choose **Next**. (You can upgrade an evaluation installation to a full installation later.)  

    - You can also specify the **Software Assurance expiration date** of your licensing agreement. It's a convenient reminder of that date. If you don't enter this date during Setup, you can specify it later from within the Configuration Manager console.  

        > [!NOTE]  
        > Microsoft doesn't validate the expiration date that you entered and doesn't use this date for license validation. You can use it as a reminder of your expiration date. This date is useful because Configuration Manager periodically checks for new software updates offered online. Your software assurance license status should be current so that you're eligible to use these additional updates.  

    For more information, see [Licensing and branches](../../../understand/learn-more-editions.md).  

5. On the **Microsoft Software License Terms** page, read and accept the license terms.  

6. On the **Prerequisite Licenses** page, read and accept the license terms for the prerequisite software. Setup downloads and automatically installs the software on site systems or clients when it's required. Accept all of the terms before you continue to the next page.  

7. On the **Prerequisite Downloads** page, specify whether Setup must download the latest prerequisite redistributable files from the internet or use previously downloaded files:  

    - If you want Setup to download the files at this time, select **Download required files**. Then specify a location to store the files.  

    - If you previously downloaded the files by using [Setup Downloader](setup-downloader.md), select **Use previously downloaded files**. Then specify the download folder.  

        > [!TIP]  
        > If you use previously downloaded files, verify that the path to the download folder contains the most recent version of the files.  

8. On the **Server Language Selection** page, select the languages that are available for the Configuration Manager console and for reports. (English is selected by default and can't be removed.) For more information, see [Language packs](language-packs.md).  

9. On the **Client Language Selection** page, select the languages that are available to client computers. Also specify whether to enable all client languages for mobile device clients. (English is selected by default and can't be removed.)  

    > [!IMPORTANT]  
    > When you use a central administration site, make sure that client languages you configure at the central administration site include all client languages that you configure at each child primary site. Clients that install from a distribution point have access to the client languages from the top-tier site, while clients that install from a management point have access to the client languages from their assigned primary site.  

10. On the **Site and Installation Settings** page, specify the following settings for the new site that you're installing:  

    - **Site code**: [Each site code in a hierarchy must be unique](prepare-to-install-sites.md#bkmk_sitecodes). Use three alpha-numeric digits: A through Z and 0 through 9. Because the site code is used in folder names, don't use Windows-reserved names, including:  
        - AUX  
        - CON  
        - NUL  
        - PRN  
        - SMS  

        > [!NOTE]  
        > Setup doesn't verify whether the site code that you specify is already in use, or if it's a reserved name.  

    - **Site name**: Each site requires this friendly name, which can help you identify the site.  

    - **Installation folder**: This folder is the path to the Configuration Manager installation. You can't change the location after the site installs. The path can't contain Unicode characters or trailing spaces.  

        > [!NOTE]  
        > Consider whether you want to use the default installation folder. If you use the default OS partition in a production environment, you may experience the following issues in the future:  
        >
        > - If Configuration Manager uses the additional free disk space on the OS partition, neither Windows or Configuration Manager will operate properly. If you install Configuration Manager on a separate partition, its disk consumption won't impact the OS.
        > - Configuration Manager performance is better with a fast disk. Some server designs don't optimize the OS disk for speed.
        > - You can service, restore, or reinstall the OS without impacting your Configuration Manager installation.  

11. On the **Site Installation** page, use the following option that matches your scenario:  

    - **I'm installing a central administration site:**  

        On the **Central Administration Site Installation** page, select **Install as the first site in a new hierarchy**, and then choose **Next** to continue.  

    - **I'm expanding a stand-alone primary into a hierarchy with a central administration site:**  

        On the **Central Administration Site Installation** page, select **Expand an existing stand-alone primary into a hierarchy**. Then specify the FQDN of the stand-alone primary site server, and choose **Next** to continue.  

        The media that you use to install the new central administration site must match the version of the primary site.  

    - **I'm installing a stand-alone primary site:**  

        On the **Primary Site Installation** page, select **Install the primary site as a stand-alone site**, and then choose **Next**.  

    - **I'm installing a child primary site:**  

        On the **Primary Site Installation** page, select **Join the primary site to an existing hierarchy**. Then specify the FQDN for the central administration site, and choose **Next**.  

12. On the **Database Information** page, specify the following information:  

    - **SQL Server name (FQDN)**: By default, this value is set to the site server computer.  

        If you use a custom port, add that port to the FQDN of the SQL Server. Follow the FQDN of the SQL Server with a comma and then the port number. For example, for server *SQLServer1.fabrikam.com*, use the following to specify port *1551*: `SQLServer1.fabrikam.com,1551`  

    - **Instance name**: By default, this value is blank. It uses the default instance of SQL on the site server computer.  

    - **Database name**: By default, this value is set to `CM_<Sitecode>`. You can customize this value.  

    - **Service Broker Port**: By default, this value is set to use the default SQL Server Service Broker (SSB) port of 4022. SQL uses it to communicate directly to the site database at other sites.  

13. On the second **Database Information** page, you can specify custom locations for the SQL Server data file and the SQL Server log file for the site database:  

    - By default, it uses the default file locations for SQL Server.  

    - When you use a SQL Server cluster, the option to specify custom file locations isn't available.  

    - The prerequisite checker doesn't run a check for free disk space for custom file locations.  

14. On the **SMS Provider Settings** page, specify the FQDN for the server where you want to install the SMS Provider.  

    - By default, it specifies the site server.  

    - After the site installs, you can configure additional SMS Providers. For more information, see [Plan for the SMS Provider](../../../plan-design/hierarchy/plan-for-the-sms-provider.md).  

15. On the **Client Communication Settings** page, choose whether to configure all site systems to accept only HTTPS communication from clients or for the communication method to be configured for each site system role.  

    When you select **All site system roles accept only HTTPS communication from clients**, the client computer must have a valid PKI certificate for client authentication. For more information, see [PKI certificate requirements](../../../plan-design/network/pki-certificate-requirements.md).  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > This step only applies when you install a primary site. If you're installing a central administration site, skip this step.  

16. On the **Site System Roles** page, choose whether to install a management point or distribution point. For each role that you choose to have installed by Setup:  

    - Enter the **FQDN** for the server that will host the role. Then choose the client connection method that the server will support: HTTP or HTTPS.  

    - If you selected **All site system roles accept only HTTPS communication from clients** on the previous page, the client connection settings are automatically configured for HTTPS. You can't change this setting unless you go back to the previous page.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > This step only applies when you install a primary site. If you're installing a central administration site, skip this step.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > To install site system roles, Setup uses the **site system installation account**. By default, this uses the primary site's computer account. This account must be a local administrator on a remote computer to install the site system role. If this account lacks the required permissions, uncheck the site system roles and install them later from within the Configuration Manager console, after configuring additional accounts to use as site system installation accounts. For more information, see [Accounts](../../../plan-design/hierarchy/accounts.md#site-system-installation-account).  

17. On the **Usage Data** page, review the information about data that Microsoft collects, and then choose **Next**. For more information, see [Diagnostics and usage data](../../../plan-design/diagnostics/diagnostics-and-usage-data.md).  

18. The **Service Connection Point Setup** page is only available during the following scenarios:  

    - When you're installing a stand-alone primary site.  

    - When you're installing a central administration site.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > If you're installing a child primary site, skip this step.  

     If you're installing a central administration site as part of a site expansion scenario, and this role is already installed at the stand-alone primary site, first uninstall this role from the stand-alone primary site. Only one instance of this role is permitted in a hierarchy, and it's only supported at the top-tier site of the hierarchy.  

     After you select a configuration for the **Service Connection Point**, choose **Next**. After Setup completes, you can change this configuration from within the Configuration Manager console. For more information, see [About the service connection point](../configure/about-the-service-connection-point.md).  

19. On the **Settings Summary** page, review the setting that you've selected. When you're ready, choose **Next** to start the Prerequisite Checker.  

20. On the **Prerequisite Installation Check** page, it lists any problems that the checker can identify.  

    - When the Prerequisite Checker finds a problem, choose an item in the list for details about how to resolve the problem.  

    - Before you can continue to install the site, resolve **Failed** items. Also try to resolve items with a status of **Warning**, but they don't block the installation of the site.  

    - After resolving issues, choose **Run Check** to rerun the Prerequisite Checker.  

        When the Prerequisite Checker runs, and no checks receive a **Failed** status, you can choose **Begin Install** to start the site installation.  

    > [!TIP]  
    > In addition to the feedback that the wizard provides, you can find additional information about prerequisite issues in the **ConfigMgrPrereq.log** file. It's in the root of the system drive of the computer on which you're installing the site. For more information, see [List of prerequisite checks](list-of-prerequisite-checks.md).  

21. On the **Installation** page, Setup displays the installation status. When the core site server installation is complete, you can **Close** the installation wizard. When you close the wizard, the installation and initial site configurations continue in the background.  

    - You can connect a Configuration Manager console to the site before Setup is complete. This console connects as read-only, and lets you view objects and settings, but you can't modify anything.  

    - After Setup completes, you can connect a console that can edit objects and settings.  


## <a name="bkmk_expand"></a> Expand a stand-alone primary site

When you've installed a stand-alone primary site as your first site, you have the option later to expand that site into a larger hierarchy by installing a central administration site.

When you expand a stand-alone primary site, you install a new central administration site that uses the existing stand-alone primary site database as a reference. After the new central administration site installs, the stand-alone primary site functions as a child primary site.

- You can only expand a stand-alone primary site into a new hierarchy.  

- You can only expand one stand-alone primary site into a specific hierarchy. You can't use this option to join additional stand-alone primary sites into the same hierarchy. Instead, use the Migration Wizard to migrate data from one hierarchy into another. For more information, see [Migrate data between hierarchies](../../../migration/migrate-data-between-hierarchies.md).  

- After you expand a stand-alone site into a hierarchy with a central administration site, you can add additional child primary child sites.  

- To remove a primary site from a hierarchy with a central administration site, first uninstall the primary site.  

To expand the site, use the Configuration Manager Setup Wizard to install a new central administration site with the following caveats:  

- Install the central administration site by using the same version of Configuration Manager as the stand-alone primary site.  

- On the **Getting Started** page of the Setup Wizard, select the option to install a central administration site. At a later stage of Setup, you'll choose an option to expand an existing stand-alone primary site.  

- When you configure the **Client Language Selection** page for the new central administration site, select the same client languages that are configured for the stand-alone primary site that you're expanding.  

- On the **Site Installation** page, select the option to expand the stand-alone primary site.  

To expand a stand-alone primary site, first see the [prerequisites to expand a site](prerequisites-for-installing-sites.md#bkmk_expand). Then use the procedure [To install a primary or central administration site](use-the-setup-wizard-to-install-sites.md#bkmk_installpri) earlier in this article.


## <a name="bkmk_secondary"></a> Install a secondary site

Use the Configuration Manager console to install a secondary site.  

- If the console you use isn't connected to the primary site that will be the parent site to the new secondary site, the command to install the site is replicated to the correct primary site.  

- Before starting the site installation, make sure that your user account has the prerequisite permissions. Also make sure that the server that will host the new secondary site meets all the prerequisites for use as a secondary site server.  

- When you install the secondary site, Configuration Manager configures the new site to use the client communication ports that are configured at the parent primary site.  

### <a name="bkmk_installsecondary"></a> Process to install a secondary site  

1. In the Configuration Manager console, go to the **Administration** workspace, expand **Site Configuration**, and select the **Sites** node. Select the site that will be the parent primary site of the new secondary site.  

2. To start the **Create Secondary Site Wizard**, choose **Create Secondary Site** in the ribbon.  

3. On the **Before You Begin** page, confirm that the primary site that's listed is the site that you want to be the parent of the new secondary site. Then choose **Next**.  

4. On the **General** page, specify the following settings:  

    - **Site code**: Each site code in a hierarchy must be unique. Use three alpha-numeric digits: A through Z and 0 through 9. Because the site code is used in folder names, don't use Windows-reserved names, including:  

        - AUX  
        - CON  
        - NUL  
        - PRN  
        - SMS  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > Setup doesn't verify whether the site code that you specify is already in use, or if it's a reserved name.  

    - **Site server name**: This value is the FQDN of the server where the new secondary site will install.  

    - **Site name**: Each site requires this friendly name, which can help you identify the site.  

    - **Installation folder**: This folder is the path to the Configuration Manager installation. You can't change the location after the site installs. The path can't contain Unicode characters or trailing spaces.  

    > [!IMPORTANT]  
    > After you specify details on this page, you can choose **Summary** to go directly to the **Summary** page of the wizard. This action uses the default settings for the remainder of the secondary site options.  
    > 
    > - Only use this option when you're familiar with the default settings in this wizard, and they're the settings you want to use.  
    > - When you use the default settings, boundary groups aren't associated with the distribution point. Until you configure boundary groups that include the secondary site server, clients won't use the distribution point that's installed on this secondary site as a content source location.  

5. On the **Installation Source Files** page, choose how the secondary site computer obtains source files for installing the site.  

    When you use CD.Latest source files that are shared on the network or copied locally to the target secondary site server:  

    - **Version 1802 and earlier**

        - The CD.Latest source file location includes a folder named **Redist**. Move this **Redist** folder as a subfolder under the **SMSSETUP** folder.  

            > [!Note]  
            > If hash mismatch errors occur during setup, update the **Redist** folder. Use the [Setup Downloader](setup-downloader.md) to get the latest files. For any files that cause a hash mismatch error, also copy them from the updated **Redist** folder to the **SMSSETUP\BIN\X64** folder.

    - **Version 1806 and later**<!-- SCCMDocs-pr issue 3164 -->

        - The CD.Latest source file location includes a folder named **Redist**. Move this **Redist** folder as a subfolder under the **SMSSETUP** folder.  

        - Copy the following files from the **Redist** folder to the **SMSSETUP\BIN\X64** folder:  
            - SharedManagementObjects.msi
            - SQLSysClrTypes.msi
            - sqlncli.msi

    - If any of the files from **Redist** aren't available, Setup fails to install the secondary site.  

    - The computer account of the secondary site server must have **Read** permissions to the source file folder and share.  

6. On the **SQL Server Settings** page, specify the version of SQL Server to use, and then configure related settings.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > Setup doesn't validate the information that you enter on this page until it starts the installation. Before you continue, verify these settings.  

    - **Install and configure a local copy of SQL Express on the secondary site computer**  

        - **SQL Server Service port**: Specify the SQL Server service port for SQL Server Express to use. The service port is typically configured to use TCP port 1433, but you can configure another port.  

        - **SQL Server Broker port**: Specify the SQL Server Service Broker (SSB) port for SQL Server Express to use. The Service Broker is typically configured to use TCP port 4022, but you can configure a different port. Specify a valid port that no other site or service is using, and that no firewall restrictions are blocking.  

    - **Use an existing SQL Server instance**  

        - **SQL Server FQDN**: Review the FQDN for the computer running SQL Server. You must use a local server running SQL Server to host the secondary site database, and you can't modify this setting.  

        - **SQL Server instance**: Specify the instance of SQL Server to use as the secondary site database. Leave this option blank to use the default instance.  

        - **ConfigMgr site database name**: Specify the name to use for the secondary site database.  

        - **SQL Server Broker port**: Specify the SQL Server Service Broker (SSB) port for SQL Server to use. Specify a valid port that no other site or service is using, and that no firewall restrictions block.  

    > [!TIP]  
    > For a list of the SQL Server versions that Configuration Manager supports, see [Supported SQL Server versions](../../../plan-design/configs/support-for-sql-server-versions.md).  

7. On the **Distribution Point** page, configure settings for the distribution point that will be installed on the secondary site server.  

    - **Required settings:**  

        - **Specify how client devices communicate with the distribution point**: Choose between HTTP and HTTPS.  

        - **Create a self-signed certificate or import a PKI client certificate**: Choose between using a self-signed certificate or importing a certificate from your PKI. A self-signed certificate lets you also allow anonymous connections from Configuration Manager clients to the content library. The certificate is used to authenticate the distribution point to a management point before the distribution point sends status messages. For more information, see [PKI certificate requirements](../../../plan-design/network/pki-certificate-requirements.md).  

    - **Optional settings:**  

        - **Install and configure IIS if required by Configuration Manager**: Select this setting to let Configuration Manager install and configure Internet Information Services (IIS) on the server, if it's not already installed. IIS is required on all distribution points.  

            > [!NOTE]  
            > Although this setting is optional, IIS must be installed on the server before a distribution point can be installed successfully.  

        - **Enable and configure BranchCache for this distribution point**  

        - **Description**: This value is a friendly description for the distribution point to help you recognize it.  

        - **Enable this distribution point for prestaged content**  

8. On the **Drive Settings** page, specify the drive settings for the secondary site distribution point.  

    You can configure up to two disk drives for the content library and two disk drives for the package share. However, Configuration Manager can use additional drives when the first two reach the configured drive space reserve. The **Drive Settings** page is where you configure the priority for the disk drives and the amount of free disk space to remain on each disk drive.  

    - **Drive space reserve (MB)**: The value that you configure for this setting determines the amount of free space on a drive before Configuration Manager chooses a different drive and continues the copy process to that drive. Content files can span multiple drives.  

    - **Content Locations**: Specify the content locations for the content library and package share. Configuration Manager copies content to the primary content location until the amount of free space reaches the value that's specified for **Drive space reserve (MB)**.  

    By default, the content locations are set to **Automatic**. The primary content location is set to the disk drive that has the most disk space at installation time. The secondary location is set to the disk drive that has the most free disk space after the primary drive. When the primary and secondary drives reach the drive space reserve, Configuration Manager selects another available drive with the most free disk space and continues the copy process.  

9. On the **Content Validation** page, specify whether to validate the integrity of content files on the distribution point.  

    - When you enable content validation on a schedule, Configuration Manager starts the process at the scheduled time. All content on the distribution point is verified.  

    - You can also configure the **Content validation priority**.  

    - To view the results of the content validation process, in the Configuration Manager console, go to the **Monitoring** workspace, expand **Distribution Status**, and select the **Content Status** node. It displays the content for each package type. These types include applications, software update packages, and boot images.  

10. On the **Boundary Groups** page, manage the boundary groups that this distribution point is assigned to:  

    - During content deployment, clients must be in a boundary group that's associated with the distribution point to use it as a source location for content.  

    - You can select the **Allow fallback source location for content** option to allow clients outside these boundary groups to fall back and use the distribution point as a source location for content when no preferred distribution points are available.  

        For more information, see the [Fundamental concepts for content management](../../../plan-design/hierarchy/fundamental-concepts-for-content-management.md).  

11. On the **Summary** page, verify the settings, and then choose **Next** to install the secondary site. When the wizard presents the **Completion** page, you can close the wizard. The secondary site installation continues in the background.  

### <a name="bkmk_verify"></a> How to verify the secondary site installation status  

1. In the Configuration Manager console, go to the **Administration** workspace, expand **Site Configuration**, and select the **Sites** node.  

2. Select the secondary site that you're installing, and then choose **Show Install Status** in the ribbon.  

    > [!TIP]  
    > When you install more than one secondary site at a time, the Prerequisite Checker runs against a single site at a time. It must finish a site before it starts to check the next site.
