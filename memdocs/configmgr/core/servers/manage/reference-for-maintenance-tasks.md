# Reference for maintenance tasks in Configuration Manager

*Applies to: Configuration Manager (current branch)*

This article lists the details for each of the Configuration Manager site maintenance tasks. Each entry specifies the site types where the task is available, and whether it's enabled by default.

For more information, see [Set up maintenance tasks](maintenance-tasks.md#set-up-maintenance-tasks).  

## Tasks

### Backup Site Server

Use this task to create a backup of your critical information to restore a site and the Configuration Manager database. For more information, see [Back up a Configuration Manager site](backup-and-recovery.md).  

| Site type | Status |
| --------- | ------ |
|**Central administration site**|Enabled|

### Clear Undiscovered Clients

> [!TIP]
> You may also see this task in the console named **Clear Install Flag**.

Use this task to remove the installed flag for clients that don't submit a Heartbeat Discovery record during the **Client Rediscovery** period. The installed flag prevents automatic client push installation to a computer that might have an active Configuration Manager client. The default value is 21 days.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Make sure this value is greater than the interval for [Heartbeat discovery](../deploy/configure/configure-discovery-methods.md#BKMK_ConfigHBDisc), which by default is seven days. Otherwise, clients will unnecessarily reinstall.<!-- 7355291 -->

### Delete Inactive Client Discovery Data

Use this task to delete from the database discovery data for inactive clients. The site marks clients as inactive when the client is flagged as obsolete and by configurations that are made for client status.

This task operates only on resources that are Configuration Manager clients. It's different than the **Delete Aged Discovery Data** task, which deletes any aged discovery data record. When this task runs at a site, it removes the data from the database at all sites in a hierarchy. For more information, see [How to configure client status](../../clients/deploy/configure-client-status.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> When it's enabled, configure this task to run at an interval greater than the **Heartbeat Discovery** schedule. This configuration enables active clients to send a Heartbeat Discovery record to mark their client record as active so this task doesn't delete them.  

| Site type | Status |
| --------- | ------ |
|Central administration site|Not available|
|**Primary site**|Not enabled|
|Secondary site|Not available|

### Delete Obsolete Alerts

Use this task to delete from the database expired alerts that have been stored longer than a specified time. For more information, see [Configure alerts](configure-alerts.md).

| Site type | Status |
| --------- | ------ |
|**Central administration site**|Enabled|
|**Primary site**|Enabled|
|Secondary site|Not available|

### Delete Obsolete Client Discovery Data

Use this task to delete obsolete client records from the database. A record that's marked as obsolete has usually been replaced by a newer record for the same client. The newer record becomes the client's current record. For information about discovery, see [Run discovery](../deploy/configure/run-discovery.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> When it's enabled, configure this task to run at an interval greater than the Heartbeat Discovery schedule. This configuration enables the client to send a Heartbeat Discovery record that correctly sets the obsolete status.  

| Site type | Status |
| --------- | ------ |
|Central administration site|Not available|
|**Primary site**|Not enabled|
|Secondary site|Not available|

### Delete Obsolete Forest Discovery Sites and Subnets

Use this task to delete data about Active Directory sites, subnets, and domains. It removes data that the site hasn't discovered by the Active Directory Forest Discovery method in the last 30 days. This task removes the discovery data, but doesn't affect boundaries that you create from this discovery data. For more information, see [Run discovery](../deploy/configure/run-discovery.md).

| Site type | Status |
| --------- | ------ |
|**Central administration site**|Enabled|
|**Primary site**|Enabled|
|Secondary site|Not available|

### Delete Orphaned Client Deployment State Records

| Site type | Status |
| --------- | ------ |
|Central administration site|Not available|
|**Primary site**|Enabled|
|Secondary site|Not available|

### Evaluate Collection Members

You configure the Collection Membership Evaluation as a site component. For more information, see [Site components](../deploy/configure/site-components.md).

| Site type | Status |
| --------- | ------ |
|Central administration site|Not available|
|**Primary site**|Enabled|
|Secondary site|Not available|

### Monitor Keys

Use this task to monitor the integrity of the Configuration Manager database primary keys. A primary key is a column or a combination of columns that uniquely identifies one row. The key distinguishes the row from any other row in a Microsoft SQL Server database table.

| Site type | Status |
| --------- | ------ |
|**Central administration site**|Enabled|
|**Primary site**|Enabled|
|Secondary site|Not available|

### Rebuild Indexes

Use this task to rebuild the Configuration Manager database indexes. An index is a database structure that's created on a database table to speed up data retrieval. For example, searching an indexed column is often much faster than searching a column that isn't indexed.

To improve performance, the Configuration Manager database indexes are frequently updated to remain synchronized with the constantly changing data that's stored in the database. This task:

- Rebuilds indexes when they are more than 10% fragmented
   - For indexes that are less than 30% fragmented, the index is reorganized
   - For indexes that are greater than 30% fragmented, the index is rebuilt

| Site type | Status |
| --------- | ------ |
|**Central administration site**|Not enabled|
|**Primary site**|Not enabled|
|**Secondary site**|Not enabled|

### Summarize Installed Software Data

Use this task to summarize the data from collected asset intelligence software information through the hardware inventory to merge multiple records into one general record. Data summarization can compress the amount of data that's stored in the Configuration Manager database. For more information, see [Configure Asset Intelligence maintenance tasks](../../clients/manage/asset-intelligence/configuring-asset-intelligence.md#BKMK_ConfigureMaintenanceTasks).

| Site type | Status |
| --------- | ------ |
|Central administration site|Not available|
|**Primary site**|Enabled|
|Secondary site|Not available|

### Summarize Software Metering File Usage Metering Data

Use this task to summarize the data from multiple records for software metering file usage into one general record. Data summarization can compress the amount of data that's stored in the Configuration Manager database.

To summarize software metering data and to conserve disk space in the database, use this task with the **Summarize Software Metering Monthly Usage Data** task. For more information, see [Software metering](../../../apps/deploy-use/monitor-app-usage-with-software-metering.md).

| Site type | Status |
| --------- | ------ |
|Central administration site|Not available|
|**Primary site**|Enabled|
|Secondary site|Not available|

### Summarize Software Metering Monthly Usage Data

Use this task to summarize the data from multiple records for software metering monthly usage into one general record. Data summarization can compress the amount of data that's stored in the Configuration Manager database.

To summarize software metering data and to conserve space in the database, use this task with the **Summarize Software Metering File Usage Data** task. For more information, see [Software metering](../../../apps/deploy-use/monitor-app-usage-with-software-metering.md).

| Site type | Status |
| --------- | ------ |
|Central administration site|Not available|
|**Primary site**|Enabled|
|Secondary site|Not available|

### Update Application Available Targeting

Use this task to have Configuration Manager recalculate the mapping of policy and application deployments to resources in collections. When you deploy policy or applications to a collection, Configuration Manager creates an initial mapping between the objects that you deploy and the collection members.

These mappings are stored in a table for quick reference. When a collections membership changes, the site updates these stored mappings to reflect those changes. However, it's possible for these mappings to fall out of sync. For example, if the site fails to properly process a notification file, that change might not be reflected in a change to the mappings. This task refreshes that mapping based on current collection membership.  

| Site type | Status |
| --------- | ------ |
|Central administration site|Not available|
|**Primary site**|Enabled|
|Secondary site|Not available|

### Update Application Catalog Tables

This task exists in the site, but isn't used. The application catalog is no longer supported.
