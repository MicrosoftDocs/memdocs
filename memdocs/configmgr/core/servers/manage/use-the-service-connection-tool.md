# Use the Service Connection Tool for Configuration Manager

*Applies to: Configuration Manager (current branch)*

Use the **service connection tool** when your service connection point is in offline mode, or when your Configuration Manager site system servers are not connected to the Internet. The tool can help you keep your site up-to-date with the latest updates to Configuration Manager.  

When run, the tool manually connects to the Configuration Manager cloud service to upload usage information for your hierarchy, and to download updates. Uploading usage data is necessary to enable the cloud service to provide the correct updates for your deployment.  

## Prerequisites for using the service connection tool
The following are prerequisites, and known issues.

**Prerequisites:**

- You  have a service connection point installed, and it is set to **Offline, on-demand connection**.  

- The tool must be run from a command prompt.  

- Each computer where the tool runs (the service connection point computer, and the computer that is connected to the internet) must be a x64 bit system and  have the following installed:  

  - Both the **Visual C++ Redistributable** x86 and x64 files.   By default, Configuration Manager installs the x64 version on the computer that hosts the service connection point.  

    To download a copy of the Visual C++ files, visit [Visual C++ Redistributable Packages for Visual Studio 2013](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=40784) at the Microsoft Download Center.  

  - .NET Framework 4.5.2 or later.  

- The account you use to run the tool must have:
  - **Local administrator** permissions on the computer that hosts the service connection point (where the tool is run).
  - **Read** permissions to the site database.  



- You will need a USB drive with sufficient free space to store the files and updates, or another method to transfer files between the service connection point computer, and the computer that has access to the Internet. (This scenario assumes that your site and managed computers do not have a direct connection to the Internet.)  



## Use the service connection tool  

 You can find the service connection tool (**serviceconnectiontool.exe**), in the Configuration Manager installation media in **%path%\smssetup\tools\ServiceConnectionTool** folder. Always use the service connection tool that matches the version of Configuration Manager that you use.


 In this procedure, the command-line examples use the following file names and folder locations (you do not need to use these paths and file names and instead can use alternatives that match your environment and preferences):  

- The path to a USB Stick where data is stored for transfer between servers:  **D:\USB\\**  

- The name of the .cab file that contains data exported from your site: **UsageData.cab**  

- The name of the empty folder where downloaded updates for Configuration Manager will be stored for transfer between servers: **UpdatePacks**  

On the computer that hosts the service connection point:  

- Open a command prompt  with administrative privileges, and then change directories to the location that contains **serviceconnectiontool.exe**.  

  By default, you can  find this tool in the Configuration Manager installation media in **%path%\smssetup\tools\ServiceConnectionTool** folder. All of the files in this folder must be in the same folder for the service connection tool to work.  

When you run the following command, the tool prepares a .cab file that contains usage information and to copies it  to a location you specify. The data in the .cab file is based on the level of diagnostic usage data your site is configured to collect. (see [Diagnostics and usage data for Configuration Manager](../../../core/plan-design/diagnostics/diagnostics-and-usage-data.md)).  Run the following command to create the .cab file:  

- **serviceconnectiontool.exe -prepare -usagedatadest D:\USB\UsageData.cab**  

You will also need to copy the ServiceConnectionTool folder with all of its contents to the USB drive, or otherwise make it available on the computer you will use for steps 3 and 4.  

### Overview
#### There are three primary steps to using the service connection tool  

1.  **Prepare**:  This step runs on the computer that hosts the service connection point. When the tool is run it puts your usage data into a .cab file and stores it on a USB drive (or alternate transfer location you specify).  

2.  **Connect**: For this step you run the tool on a remote computer that connects to the Internet so you can upload your usage data and then download updates.  

3.  **Import**: This step runs on the computer that hosts the service connection point. When run, the tool imports the updates you downloaded and adds them to your site so you can then view and install those updates from the Configuration Manager console.  

Beginning with version 1606, when connecting to Microsoft you can upload multiple .cab files at one time (each from a different hierarchy), and specify a proxy server and a user for the proxy server.   

#### To upload multiple .cab files
- Place each .cab file you export from separate hierarchies into the same folder. The name of each file must be unique, and you can manually rename them if necessary.
- Then, when you run the command to upload data to Microsoft, you specify the folder that contains the .cab files. (Prior to update 1606, you could only upload data from a single hierarchy at a time, and the tool required you to specify the name of the .cab file in the folder.)
- Later, when you run the import task on the service connection point of a hierarchy, the tool automatically imports only the data for that hierarchy.  

#### To specify a proxy server
You can use the following optional parameters to specify a proxy server (More information about using these parameters is available in the Command line parameters section of this topic):
- **-proxyserveruri [FQDN_of_proxy_server]**  Use this parameter to specify the proxy server to use for this connection.
- **-proxyusername [username]**  Use this parameter when  you must specify a user for the proxy server.

#### Specify the type of updates to download
Beginning with version 1706, the tools default download behavior has changed, and the tool supports options to control what files you download.
- By default, the tool downloads only the latest available update that applies to the version of your site. It does not download hotfixes.

To modify this behavior, use one of the following parameters to change what files are downloaded. 

> [!NOTE]
> The version of your site is determined from the data in the .cab file that is uploaded when the tool runs.
>
> You can verify the version by looking for the *SiteVersion*.txt file within the .cab file.

- **-downloadall**  This option downloads everything, including updates and hotfixes, regardless of the version of your site.
- **-downloadhotfix**  This option downloads all hotfixes regardless of the version of your site.
- **-downloadsiteversion**  This option downloads updates and hotfixes that have a version that is higher than the version of your site.

Example command line that uses *-downloadsiteversion*:
- **serviceconnectiontool.exe -connect  *-downloadsiteversion* -usagedatasrc D:\USB -updatepackdest D:\USB\UpdatePacks**




### To use the service connection tool  

1. On the computer that hosts the service connection point:  

   - Open a command prompt  with administrative privileges, and then change directories to the location that contains **serviceconnectiontool.exe**.   

2. Run the following command to have the tool prepare a .cab file that contains usage information and to copy it  to a location you specify:  

   - **serviceconnectiontool.exe -prepare -usagedatadest D:\USB\UsageData.cab**  

   If you will upload .cab files from more than one hierarchy at the same time, each .cab file in the folder must have a unique name. You can manually rename files that you add to the folder.

   If you want to  view the usage information that is gathered to be uploaded to the Configuration Manager cloud service, run the following command to export the same data as a .csv file which you can then view using an application like Excel:  

   - **serviceconnectiontool.exe -export -dest D:\USB\UsageData.csv**  

3. After the prepare step is complete, move the USB drive (or transfer the exported data by another method) to a computer that has access to the Internet.  

4. On the computer with Internet access, open a command prompt  with administrative privileges, and then change directories to the location that contains a copy of the tool  **serviceconnectiontool.exe** and the additional files from that folder.  

5. Run the following command to begin the upload of usage information and the download of updates for Configuration Manager:  

   - **serviceconnectiontool.exe -connect -usagedatasrc D:\USB -updatepackdest D:\USB\UpdatePacks**

   For more examples of this command line, see the [Command line options](../../../core/servers/manage/use-the-service-connection-tool.md#bkmk_cmd) section later in this topic.

   > [!NOTE]  
   >  When you run the command line to connect to the Configuration Manager cloud service, an error similar to the following might occur:  
   >   
   > - Unhandled Exception: System.UnauthorizedAccessException:  
   >   
   >      Access to the path 'C:\  
   >     Users\br\AppData\Local\Temp\extractmanifestcab\95F8A562.sql' is denied.  
   >   
   > This error can be safely ignored and you can close the error window, and continue.  

6. After the download of updates for Configuration Manager  is complete, move the USB drive (or transfer the exported data by another method) to the computer that hosts the service connection point.  

7. On the computer that hosts the service connection point, open a command prompt  with administrative privileges, change directories to the location that contains **serviceconnectiontool.exe**, and then run the following command:  

   - **serviceconnectiontool.exe -import -updatepacksrc D:\USB\UpdatePacks**  

8. After the import completes, you can close the command prompt. (Only updates for the applicable hierarchy are imported).  

9. Open  the Configuration Manager console and navigate to **Administration** > **Updates and Servicing**. Updates that were imported are now available to install. (Prior to version 1702, Updates and Servicing was under **Administration** > **Cloud Services**.)

   For information about installing updates, see  [Install in-console updates for Configuration Manager](../../../core/servers/manage/install-in-console-updates.md).  

## <a name="bkmk_cmd"></a> Log Files

**ServiceConnectionTool.log**

Each time you run the service connection tool, a log file will generate in the same location as the tool called **ServiceConnectionTool.log**.  This log file will provide simple details about the execution of the tool based on what commands are used.  An existing log file will be replaced each time you run the tool.

**ConfigMgrSetup.log**

When using the tool to connect and download updates, a log file will generate on the root of the system drive called **ConfigMgrSetup.log**.  This log file will provide you with more detailed information such as what files are downloaded, extracted, and if the hash checks are successful.
