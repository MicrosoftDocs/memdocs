# Unattended site recovery for Configuration Manager   

*Applies to: Configuration Manager (current branch)*

 To perform an [unattended recovery](recover-sites.md#site-recovery-procedures) of a Configuration Manager central administration site or primary site, you can create an unattended installation script and then use setup with the **/script** command option. The script provides the same type of information that the setup wizard prompts for, except that there are no default settings. All values must be specified for the setup keys that apply to the type of recovery you are using.

 To use the /script setup command-line option, you must create an initialization file. Then specify this file name after the /script option. The name of the file is unimportant as long as it has the **.ini** file name extension. When you reference the setup initialization file from the command line, you must provide the full path to the file. For example, if your setup initialization file is named *setup.ini*, and it is stored in the *C:\setup folder*, your command line would be:

 `setup /script c:\setup\setup.ini`

> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  You must have Administrator rights to run setup. When you run setup with the unattended script, start the command prompt in an Administrator context by using **Run as administrator**.

 The script contains section names, key names, and values. Required section key names vary depending on the recovery type that you are scripting. The order of the keys within sections, and the order of sections within the file, is not important. The keys are not case-sensitive. When you provide values for keys, the name of the key must be followed by an equals sign (=) and the value for the key.

 Use the following sections to help you to create your script for unattended site recovery. The tables list the available setup script keys, their corresponding values, whether they are required, which type of installation they are used for, and a short description for the key.

## Recover a central administration site unattended
 Use the following information to configure an unattended setup script file to recover a central administration site.

 **Identification**

-   **Key name:** Action

    -   **Required:** Yes
    -   **Values:** RecoverCCAR
    -   **Details:** Recovers a central administration site


-   **Key Name:** CDLatest

    -   **Required:** Yes â€“ Only when using media from the CD.Latest folder.
    -   **Values:** 1
        Any value other than 1 is considered to not be using CD.Latest.
    -   **Details:** Your script must include this key and value when you run setup from media in a CD.Latest folder for the purpose of installing a primary or central administration site, or recovering a primary or central administration site. This value informs setup that media form CD.Latest is being used.

**RecoveryOptions**   
-   **Key name:** ServerRecoveryOptions   

    -   **Required:** Yes
    -   **Values:** 1, 2, or 4  
         1 = Recovery site server and SQL Server.   
         2 = Recover site server only.  
         4 = Recover SQL Server only.
    -   **Details:** Specifies whether setup recovers the site server, SQL Server, or both. The associated keys are required when you set the following value for the ServerRecoveryOptions setting:  
        -   **Value = 1** You have the option to specify a value for the **SiteServerBackupLocation** key to recover the site by using a site backup. If you do not specify a value, the site is reinstalled without restoring it from a backup set.

             The **BackupLocation** key is required when you configure a value of **10** for the **DatabaseRecoveryOptions** key, which is to restore the site database from backup.

        -   **Value = 2** You have the option to specify a value for the **SiteServerBackupLocation** key to recover the site by using a site backup. If you do not specify a value, the site is reinstalled without restoring it from a backup set.

        -   **Value = 4** The **BackupLocation** key is required when you configure a value of **10** for the **DatabaseRecoveryOptions** key, which is to restore the site database from backup.

-   **Key name:** DatabaseRecoveryOptions

    -   **Required:** Maybe
    -   **Values:**

         - **40** = Create a new database for the site. Use this option when there is no site database backup available. Global and site data is recovered through replication from other sites.  
         - **80** = skip database recovery.
    -   **Details:** Specifies how setup recovers the site database in SQL Server. This key is required when the **ServerRecoveryOptions** setting has a value of **1** or **4**.


-   **Key name:** ReferenceSite  

    -   **Required:** Maybe
    -   **Values:** &lt;ReferenceSiteFQDN\>
    -   **Details:** Specifies the reference primary site. If the database backup is older than the change tracking retention period, or you recover the site without a backup, the central administration site uses the reference site to recover global data.

         When you do not specify a reference site, and the backup is older than the change tracking retention period, all primary sites are reinitialized with the restored data from the central administration site.

         When you do not specify a reference site, and the backup is within the change tracking retention period, only changes since the backup are replicated from primary sites. When there are conflicting changes from different primary sites, the central administration site uses the first one that it receives.
