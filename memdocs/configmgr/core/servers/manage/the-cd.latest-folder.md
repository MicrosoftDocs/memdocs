# The CD.Latest folder for Configuration Manager

*Applies to: Configuration Manager (current branch)*

Configuration Manager has a process to deliver updates to the product from within the Configuration Manager console. To support this new method of updating Configuration Manager, a new folder is created named **CD.Latest**. This folder contains a copy of the Configuration Manager installation files for the updated version of your site.

The CD.Latest folder contains a folder named **Redist**, which contains the redistributable files that setup downloads and uses. These files are matched to the version of Configuration Manager files found in that CD.Latest folder. When you run Setup from a CD.Latest folder, you must use files that are matched to that version of Setup. You can either direct Setup to download new and current files from Microsoft, or direct Setup to use the files from the Redist folder included in the CD.Latest folder.

Baseline media doesn't include a **Redist** folder. The site doesn't create a Redist folder until you install an in-console update. In the meantime, use the Redist folder that you used when installing sites from the baseline media.

> [!TIP]
> Make sure the redistributable files you use are current. If you haven't recently downloaded redistributable files, plan to allow Setup to do so from Microsoft.

The following scenarios create or update the CD.Latest folder on a central administration site or primary site server:

- When you install an update or hotfix from within the Configuration Manager console, the site creates or updates the folder in the Configuration Manager installation folder.

- When you run the built-in Configuration Manager backup task, the site creates or updates the folder under the designated backup folder location.

- When you install a new site using baseline media, the site creates the CD.Latest folder.

## Supported scenarios

The source files from the CD.Latest folder are supported for the following scenarios:

### Backup and recovery

To recover a site, use the source files from a CD.Latest folder that matches your site. When you run a site backup using the built-in site backup task, the CD.Latest folder is included as part of the backup.

- When you reinstall a site as part of a site recovery, you install the site from the CD.Latest folder included in your backup. This action installs the site using the file versions that match your site backup and site database.

  - If you don't have access the correct CD.Latest folder version, get the CD.Latest folder with the correct file versions by installing a site in a lab environment. Then update that site to match the version you want to recover.

  - If you don't have the correct CD.Latest folder and its contents available, you can't recover a site. In this circumstance, you need to reinstall the site.

- When you don't have a CD.Latest folder, but do have a working child primary site or central administration site, you can use that site as a reference site for a site recovery.

### Install a child primary site

When you want to install a new child primary site below a central administration site that has installed one or more in-console updates, use Setup and the source files from the CD.Latest folder from the central administration site. This process uses installation source files that match the version of the central administration site. For more information, see [Use the Setup Wizard to install sites](../deploy/install/use-the-setup-wizard-to-install-sites.md).

### Expand a stand-alone primary site

When you expand a stand-alone primary site by installing a new central administration site, use Setup and the source files from the CD.Latest folder from the primary site. This process uses installation source files that match the version of the primary site. For more information, see [Expand a stand-alone primary site](../deploy/install/use-the-setup-wizard-to-install-sites.md#bkmk_expand).

### Install a secondary site
<!-- SCCMDocs-pr issue #3164 -->

When you want to install a new secondary site below a primary site that has installed one or more in-console updates, use the source files from the CD.Latest folder from the primary site.

For more information, see [Install a secondary site](../deploy/install/use-the-setup-wizard-to-install-sites.md#bkmk_secondary).

## Unsupported scenarios

The updated CD.Latest source files aren't supported for:

- Installing a new site for a new hierarchy
- Upgrading a Microsoft System Center 2012 Configuration Manager site to Configuration Manager current branch
- Installing Configuration Manager clients
- Installing Configuration Manager consoles
