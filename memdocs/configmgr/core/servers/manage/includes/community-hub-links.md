You can navigate to and reference items in the Configuration Manager console **Community hub** node with a direct link. Collaborate with your colleagues easily by sharing direct links to Community hub items. These deep links are currently only for items in the **Community hub** node of the console.

Prerequisites for direct links:

- Configuration Manager console version 2006 or later
- You can't use the local built-in administrator account when following a Community hub link.

Share an item:
1. Go the item in the hub and select **Share**.
1. Paste the copied link and share it with others.

Open a shared link:
1. Open the link from a machine that has the Configuration Manager console installed.
   - For example, use this link to share the [Configure Microsoft Edge Auto Update script](https://communityhub.microsoft.com/item/7200) (`https://communityhub.microsoft.com/item/7200`).
1. Select **Launch the Community hub** when prompted.
1. The console opens directly to the script in the **Community hub** node.
