<!-- ## Update and configure the .NET Framework to support TLS 1.2 Note: the heading in in the 2 articles (enable-tls-1-2-client & enable-tls-1-2-server) to better facilitate linking. -->

### Determine .NET version

First, determine the installed .NET versions. For more information, see [How to determine which versions and service pack levels of the Microsoft .NET Framework are installed](https://support.microsoft.com/help/318785/how-to-determine-which-versions-and-service-pack-levels-of-the-microso).

### Install .NET updates

Install the .NET updates so you can enable strong cryptography. Some versions of .NET Framework might require updates to enable strong cryptography. Use these guidelines:

- NET Framework 4.6.2 and later supports TLS 1.1 and TLS 1.2. Confirm the registry settings, but no additional changes are required.

- Update NET Framework 4.6 and earlier versions to support TLS 1.1 and TLS 1.2. For more information, see [.NET Framework versions and dependencies](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/framework/migration-guide/versions-and-dependencies).

- If you're using .NET Framework 4.5.1 or 4.5.2 on Windows 8.1 or Windows Server 2012, the relevant updates and details are also available from the [Download Center](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=42883).


### Configure for strong cryptography

Configure .NET Framework to support strong cryptography. Set the `SchUseStrongCrypto` registry setting to `DWORD:00000001`. This value disables the RC4 stream cipher and requires a restart. For more information about this setting, see [Microsoft Security Advisory 296038](https://docs.microsoft.com/security-updates/SecurityAdvisories/2015/2960358).

Make sure to set the following registry keys on any computer that communicates across the network with a TLS 1.2-enabled system. For example, Configuration Manager clients, remote site system roles not installed on the site server, and the site server itself.

For 32-bit applications that are running on 32-bit OSs and for 64-bit applications that are running on 64-bit OSs, update the following subkey values:

``` Registry
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\.NETFramework\v2.0.50727]
      "SystemDefaultTlsVersions" = dword:00000001
      "SchUseStrongCrypto" = dword:00000001
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\.NETFramework\v4.0.30319]
      "SystemDefaultTlsVersions" = dword:00000001
      "SchUseStrongCrypto" = dword:00000001
```

For 32-bit applications that are running on 64-bit OSs, update the following subkey values:

``` Registry
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\.NETFramework\v2.0.50727]
      "SystemDefaultTlsVersions" = dword:00000001
      "SchUseStrongCrypto" = dword:00000001
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\WOW6432Node\Microsoft\.NETFramework\v4.0.30319]
      "SystemDefaultTlsVersions" = dword:00000001
      "SchUseStrongCrypto" = dword:00000001
```

> [!Note]  
> The `SchUseStrongCrypto` setting allows .NET to use TLS 1.1 and TLS 1.2. The `SystemDefaultTlsVersions` setting allows .NET to use the OS configuration. For more information, see [TLS best practices with the .NET Framework](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/framework/network-programming/tls).
