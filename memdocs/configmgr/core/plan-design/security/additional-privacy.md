# Additional information about privacy for Configuration Manager

*Applies to: Configuration Manager (current branch)*


## Updates and servicing

Configuration Manager uses an update model that helps keep your environment current with the latest updates and features. This feature uses a site system role called the service connection point. You choose the server where to install this role. 

For more information about collected information and how it's used, see [Usage data](#usage-data).



## Usage data

Configuration Manager collects diagnostics and usage data about itself, which Microsoft uses to improve the installation experience, quality, and security of future releases.
Diagnostics and usage data is enabled for each Configuration Manager hierarchy. It consists of SQL Server queries that run on a weekly basis on each primary site and at the central administration site. When the hierarchy uses a central administration site, the data from primary sites is then replicated to that site. At the top-level site of your hierarchy, the service connection point submits this information when it checks for updates. If the service connection point is in offline mode, the information is transferred by using the service connection tool.

Configuration Manager collects data only from the site's SQL server database, and it doesn't collect data directly from clients or site servers.

Administrators can change the level of data that's collected by going to the **Usage Data** section of the Configuration Manager console.

For more information about usage data levels and settings, see [Diagnostics and usage data](../diagnostics/diagnostics-and-usage-data.md).



## Log Analytics Connector

The Log Analytics Connector syncs data, such as collections, from Configuration Manager to the Azure cloud service. The Azure subscription ID and secret key are stored in the Configuration Manager database when an admin configures the feature. Both the Azure Active Directory client secret and the Azure workspace shared key are stored in the on-premises Configuration Manager database. All communications between Configuration Manager and Azure use HTTPS. No additional information about the collections is provided to Microsoft outside of randomized diagnostics and usage data. 

For more information about the information that Log Analytics collects, see [Log analytics data security](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/log-analytics/log-analytics-data-security).



## Asset Intelligence

Asset Intelligence lets administrators define, track, and proactively manage conformity with configuration standards. Metering and reporting on the deployment and use of both physical and virtual applications helps organizations make better business decisions about software licensing and maintain compliance with licensing agreements. After collecting usage data from Configuration Manager clients, you can use different features to view the data, including collections, queries, and reporting.

During each synchronization, a catalog of known software is downloaded from Microsoft. You can choose to send Microsoft information about uncategorized software titles that are discovered within your organization to be researched and added to the catalog. Prior to uploading this information, a dialog box shows data that's going to be uploaded. Uploaded data can't be recalled. Asset Intelligence doesn't send information about users and computers or license usage to Microsoft.

After a software title is uploaded, Microsoft researchers identify, categorize, and then make that knowledge available to all other customers who use this feature and other consumers of the catalog. Any uploaded software title becomes public. The application and its categorization become part of the catalog and then can be downloaded to other consumers of the catalog. Before you configure Asset Intelligence data collection and decide whether to submit information to Microsoft, consider the privacy requirements of your organization.

Asset Intelligence isn't enabled by default in Configuration Manager. Uploading uncategorized titles never occurs automatically, and the system isn't designed to automate this task. You must manually select and approve the upload of each software title.



## Endpoint Protection

Microsoft Cloud Protection Service was formerly known as Microsoft Active Protection Service or MAPS.

The applicable products are System Center Endpoint Protection and the Endpoint Protection feature of Configuration Manager (to manage System Center Endpoint Protection and Windows Defender for Windows 10). This feature isn't implemented for System Center Endpoint Protection for Linux or System Center Endpoint Protection for Mac.

The Microsoft Cloud Protection Service antimalware community is a voluntary worldwide online community that includes System Center Endpoint Protection users. When you join Microsoft Cloud Protection Service, System Center Endpoint Protection automatically sends information to Microsoft. Microsoft uses the information to determine software to investigate for potential threats and to help improve the effectiveness of System Center Endpoint Protection. This community helps stop the spread of new malicious software infections. If a Microsoft Cloud Protection Service report includes details about malware or potentially unwanted software that the Endpoint Protection client may be able to remove, Microsoft Cloud Protection Service downloads the latest signature to address it. Microsoft Cloud Protection Service can also find "false positives" and fix them. (False positives are where something originally identified as malware turns out not to be.) 

Microsoft Cloud Protection Service reports include information about potential malware files, like file names, cryptographic hash, vendor, size, and date stamps. In addition, Microsoft Cloud Protection Service might collect full URLs to indicate the origin of the file. These URLs might occasionally have personal information like search terms or data that was entered in forms. Reports might also include actions that you took when Endpoint Protection notified you about unwanted software. Microsoft Cloud Protection Service reports include this information to help Microsoft gauge how effectively Endpoint Protection can detect and remove malware and potentially unwanted software and to attempt to identify new malware.

You can join Microsoft Cloud Protection Service if you have a basic or advanced membership. Basic member reports have the information described previously. Advanced member reports are more comprehensive and may include additional details about the software that Endpoint Protection detects, like the location of such software, file names, how the software operates, and how it has affected your computer. These reports and reports from other Endpoint Protection users who participate in Microsoft Cloud Protection Service help Microsoft researchers discover new threats more rapidly. Malware definitions are then created for programs that meet the analysis criteria, and the updated definitions are made available to all users through Microsoft Update.

To help detect and fix certain kinds of malware infections, the product regularly sends Microsoft Cloud Protection Service information about the security state of your PC. This information includes information about your PC's security settings and log files that describe the drivers and other software that load while your PC boots.

A number that uniquely identifies your PC is also sent. Also, Microsoft Cloud Protection Service may collect the IP addresses that the potential malware files connect to.

Microsoft Cloud Protection Service reports are used to improve Microsoft software and services. The reports might also be used for statistical or other testing or analytical purposes and to generate definitions. Only Microsoft employees, contractors, partners, and vendors who have a business need to use the reports can access them.

Microsoft Cloud Protection Service does not intentionally collect personal information. To the extent that Microsoft Cloud Protection Service collects any personal information, Microsoft does not use the information to identify you or contact you.

For more information, see [Endpoint Protection](../../../protect/deploy-use/endpoint-protection.md).



## Site Hierarchy â€“ Geographical View with Bing Maps

In the Configuration Manager console, go to the **Monitoring** workspace, select the **Site Hierarchy** node, and switch to the **Geographical View**. This view lets you use maps that Microsoft Bing Maps provides to view your Configuration Manager physical server topology. To enable this feature, location information that you provide is sent from your server to the Bing Maps Web service.

Microsoft uses the information to operate and improve Microsoft Bing Maps and other Microsoft sites and services. For more information, see the [Microsoft Privacy Statement](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=823548).

You can choose not to use the Geographical View for the Site Hierarchy. The default Hierarchy Diagram view lets you see the hierarchy and doesn't use the Bing Maps service.
