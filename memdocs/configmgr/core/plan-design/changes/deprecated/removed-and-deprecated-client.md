# Removed and deprecated items for Configuration Manager clients

*Applies to: Configuration Manager (current branch)*

This article describes products and operating systems that are removed from support for Configuration Manager clients, or will be removed in a future update (deprecated). It provides early notice about future changes that might affect your use of Configuration Manager.  

This information may change in the future. It might not include each deprecated feature, product, or operating system.  

## Deprecated client operating systems  

Unless noted otherwise, each supported OS is supported as a Configuration Manager client until the *extended support end date* of that OS version. For more information about extended support end dates, see the [Microsoft Support Lifecycle](https://support.microsoft.com/lifecycle). If Configuration Manager support for an OS ends before the extended support end date, this article lists a deprecation date and support removal date for that OS.  

<!-- 
The following OS versions are deprecated as a Configuration Manager client. You can still use them now, but Microsoft plans to end support in the future.

|OS version|Deprecation first announced|Support removed|
