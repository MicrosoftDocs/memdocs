### WINS

Windows Internet Name Service (WINS) is a legacy computer name registration and resolution service. It's a deprecated service. You should replace WINS with Domain Name System (DNS). For more information, see [Windows Internet Name Service (WINS)](/windows-server/networking/technologies/wins/wins-top).

### Out of Band Management

With Configuration Manager, native support for AMT-based computers from within the Configuration Manager console has been removed.

- AMT-based computers remain fully managed when you use the [Intel SCS Add-on for Configuration Manager](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/software/setup-configuration-software.html). The add-on provides you access to the latest capabilities to manage AMT, while removing limitations introduced until Configuration Manager could incorporate those changes.

- Out of Band Management in System Center 2012 Configuration Manager is not affected by this change.

### Network Access Protection

Configuration Manager has removed support for Network Access Protection. The feature has been deprecated in Windows Server 2012 R2, and is removed from Windows 10.

For network access protection alternatives, see the *Deprecated functionality* section of [Network Policy and Access Services Overview](/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2012-R2-and-2012/hh831683(v=ws.11)).
