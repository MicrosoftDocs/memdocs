# Internet access requirements

Some Configuration Manager features rely on internet connectivity for full functionality. If your organization restricts network communication with the internet using a firewall or proxy device, make sure to allow these endpoints.

<!-- SCCMDocs-pr #3403 -->

Configuration Manager uses the following Microsoft URL forwarding services throughout the product:

- `https://aka.ms`
- `https://go.microsoft.com`

Even if they're not explicitly listed in the sections below, you should always allow these endpoints.

## Service connection point

For more information, see [About the service connection point](../../servers/deploy/configure/about-the-service-connection-point.md).

[!INCLUDE [Internet endpoints for service connection point](includes/internet-endpoints-service-connection-point.md)]

## Updates and servicing

For more information, see [Updates and servicing](../../servers/manage/updates.md).

> [!TIP]
> Enable these endpoints for the [management insight](../../servers/manage/management-insights.md) rule, **Connect the site to the Microsoft cloud for Configuration Manager updates**.

- `management.azure.com` (Azure public cloud)
- `management.usgovcloudapi.net` (Azure US Government cloud)

## Co-management

If you enroll Windows 10 devices to Microsoft Intune for co-management, make sure those devices can access the endpoints required by Intune. For more information, see [Network endpoints for Microsoft Intune](/intune/intune-endpoints).

## Microsoft Store for Business

If you integrate Configuration Manager with the [Microsoft Store for Business](../../../apps/deploy-use/manage-apps-from-the-windows-store-for-business.md), make sure the service connection point and targeted devices can access the cloud service. For more information, see [Microsoft Store for Business proxy configuration](/microsoft-store/prerequisites-microsoft-store-for-business#proxy-configuration).

## Delivery optimization

If you use delivery optimization, clients need to communicate with its cloud service: `*.do.dsp.mp.microsoft.com`

Distribution points that support Microsoft Connected Cache also require these endpoints.

For more information, see the following articles:

- [Delivery optimization FAQ](/windows/deployment/update/waas-delivery-optimization#frequently-asked-questions)
- [Fundamental concepts for content management in Configuration Manager](../hierarchy/fundamental-concepts-for-content-management.md#delivery-optimization)
- [Microsoft Connected Cache in Configuration Manager](../hierarchy/microsoft-connected-cache.md)

## Cloud services

<!-- SCCMDocs-pr #3402 -->

For more information on the cloud management gateway (CMG), see [Plan for CMG](../../clients/manage/cmg/data-flow.md).

[!INCLUDE [Internet endpoints for cloud services](includes/internet-endpoints-cloud-services.md)]

## Software updates

Allow the active software update point to access the following endpoints so that WSUS and Automatic Updates can communicate with the Microsoft Update cloud service:  

- `http://windowsupdate.microsoft.com`  

- `http://*.windowsupdate.microsoft.com`  

- `https://*.windowsupdate.microsoft.com`  

- `http://*.update.microsoft.com`  

- `https://*.update.microsoft.com`  

- `http://*.windowsupdate.com`  

- `http://download.windowsupdate.com`  

- `http://download.microsoft.com`  

- `http://*.download.windowsupdate.com`  

- `http://ntservicepack.microsoft.com`  

For more information on software updates, see [Plan for software updates](../../../sum/plan-design/plan-for-software-updates.md).

### Intranet firewall

You might need to add endpoints to a firewall that's between two site systems in the following cases:

- If child sites have a software update point
- If there's a remote active internet-based software update point at a site

#### Software update point on the child site

- `http://<FQDN for software update point on child site>`  

- `https://<FQDN for software update point on child site>`  

- `http://<FQDN for software update point on parent site>`  

- `https://<FQDN for software update point on parent site>`  

## Manage Microsoft 365 Apps

> [!NOTE]
> Starting on April 21, 2020, Office 365 ProPlus is being renamed to **Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise**. For more information, see [Name change for Office 365 ProPlus](/deployoffice/name-change). You may still see references to the old name in the Configuration Manager console and supporting documentation while the console is being updated.

If you use Configuration Manager to deploy and update Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise, allow the following endpoints:

<!-- SCCMDocs#929 -->

- `officecdn.microsoft.com` to synchronize the software update point for Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise client updates

- `config.office.com` to create custom configurations for Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise deployments

- `contentstorage.osi.office.net` to support the evaluation of Office add-in readiness<!-- MEMDocs#410 -->

Your top-level site server needs access to the following endpoint to download the Microsoft Apps 365 readiness file:

- Starting March 2, 2021: `https://omex.cdn.office.net/mirrored/sccmreadiness/SOT_SCCM_AddinReadiness.CAB`
   - Location prior to March 2, 2021: `https://contentstorage.osi.office.net/sccmreadinessppe/sot_sccm_addinreadiness.cab`

> [!NOTE]
> The location of this file is changing *March 2, 2021* <!--edit this, placeholder line-->. For more information, see [Download location change for Microsoft 365 Apps readiness file](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/configuration-manager-blog/download-location-change-for-microsoft-365-apps-readiness-file/ba-p/2110282).

## Configuration Manager console

Computers with the Configuration Manager console require access to the following internet endpoints for specific features:

> [!NOTE]
> For push notifications from Microsoft to show in the console, the service connection point needs access to `configmgrbits.azureedge.net`. It also needs access to this endpoint for [updates and servicing](#updates-and-servicing), so you may have already allowed it.

## Deploy Microsoft Edge

[!INCLUDE [Internet endpoints for deploying Microsoft Edge](includes/internet-endpoints-deploy-microsoft-edge.md)]

## Microsoft public IP addresses
