# Step-by-step example deployment of the PKI certificates for Configuration Manager: Windows Server 2008 certification authority

*Applies to: Configuration Manager (current branch)*

This step-by-step example deployment, which uses a Windows Server 2008 certification authority (CA), has procedures that show you how to create and deploy the public key infrastructure (PKI) certificates that Configuration Manager uses. These procedures use an enterprise certification authority (CA) and certificate templates. The steps are appropriate for a test network only, as a proof of concept.  

Because there's no single method of deployment for the required certificates, consult your particular PKI deployment documentation for the required procedures and best practices to deploy the required certificates for a production environment. For more about the certificate requirements, see [PKI certificate requirements for Configuration Manager](pki-certificate-requirements.md).  

> [!TIP]
> You can adapt the instructions in this topic for operating systems that aren't documented in the Test Network Requirements section. However, if you are running the issuing CA on Windows Server 2012, you're not prompted for the certificate template version. Instead, specify this on the **Compatibility** tab of the template properties:  
>
> - **Certification Authority**: **Windows Server 2003**  
>   - **Certificate recipient**: **Windows XP / Server 2003**  

## <a name="BKMK_testnetworkenvironment"></a> Test network requirements

The step-by-step instructions have the following requirements:  

- The test network is running Active Directory Domain Services with Windows Server 2008, and it is installed as a single domain, single forest.  

- You have a member server running Windows Server 2008 Enterprise Edition, which has the Active Directory Certificate Services role installed on it, and it is set up as an enterprise root certification authority (CA).  

- You have one computer that has Windows Server 2008 (Standard Edition or Enterprise Edition, R2 or later) installed on it, that computer is designated as a member server, and Internet Information Services (IIS) is installed on it. This computer will be the Configuration Manager site system server that you will configure with an intranet fully qualified domain name (FQDN) to support client connections on the intranet and an internet FQDN if you must support mobile devices that are enrolled by Configuration Manager and clients on the internet.  

- You have one Windows Vista client that has the latest service pack installed, and this computer is set up with a computer name that comprises ASCII characters and is joined to the domain. This computer will be a Configuration Manager client computer.  

- You can sign in with a root domain administrator account or an enterprise domain administrator account and use this account for all procedures in this example deployment.  

## <a name="BKMK_overview2008"></a> Overview of the certificates

The following table lists the types of PKI certificates that might be required for Configuration Manager and describes how they are used.  

|Certificate Requirement|Certificate Description|  
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|  
|Web server certificate for site systems that run IIS|This certificate is used to encrypt data and authenticate the server to clients. It must be installed externally from Configuration Manager on site systems servers that run Internet Information Services (IIS) and that are set up in Configuration Manager to use HTTPS.<br /><br /> For the steps to set up and install this certificate, see [Deploy the web server certificate for site systems that run IIS](#BKMK_webserver2008_cm2012) in this topic.|  
|Service certificate for clients to connect to cloud-based distribution points|For the steps to configure and install this certificate, see [Deploy the service certificate for cloud-based distribution points](#BKMK_clouddp2008_cm2012) in this topic.<br /><br /> **Important:** This certificate is used in conjunction with the Windows Azure management certificate. For more about the management certificate, see [How to Create a Management Certificate](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cloud-services/cloud-services-certs-create#create-a-new-self-signed-certificate) and [How to Add a Management Certificate to a Windows Azure Subscription](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cloud-services/cloud-services-configure-ssl-certificate-portal#step-3-upload-a-certificate) in the Windows Azure Platform section of the MSDN Library.|  
|Client certificate for Windows computers|This certificate is used to authenticate Configuration Manager client computers to site systems that are set up to use HTTPS. It can also be used for management points and state migration points to monitor their operational status when they are set up to use HTTPS. It must be installed externally from Configuration Manager on computers.<br /><br /> For the steps to set up and install this certificate, see [Deploy the client certificate for Windows computers](#BKMK_client2008_cm2012) in this topic.|  
|Client certificate for distribution points|This certificate has two purposes:<br /><br /> The certificate is used to authenticate the distribution point to an HTTPS-enabled management point before the distribution point sends status messages.<br /><br /> When the **Enable PXE support for clients** distribution point option is selected, the certificate is sent to computers that PXE boot so that they can connect to a HTTPS-enabled management point during the deployment of the operating system.<br /><br /> For the steps to set up and install this certificate, see [Deploy the client certificate for distribution points](#BKMK_clientdistributionpoint2008_cm2012) in this topic.|  
|Enrollment certificate for mobile devices|This certificate is used to authenticate Configuration Manager mobile device clients to site systems that are set up to use HTTPS. It must be installed as part of mobile device enrollment in Configuration Manager, and you choose the configured certificate template as a mobile device client setting.<br /><br /> For the steps to set up this certificate, see [Deploy the enrollment certificate for mobile devices](#BKMK_mobiledevices2008_cm2012) in this topic.|  
|Client certificate for Mac computers|You can request and install this certificate from a Mac computer when you use Configuration Manager enrollment and choose the configured certificate template as a mobile device client setting.<br /><br /> For the steps to set up this certificate, see [Deploy the client certificate for Mac computers](#BKMK_MacClient_SP1) in this topic.|  

## <a name="BKMK_webserver2008_cm2012"></a> Deploy the web server certificate for site systems that run IIS

This certificate deployment has the following procedures:  

- Create and issue the web server certificate template on the certification authority  

- Request the web server certificate  

- Configure IIS to use the web server certificate  

### <a name="BKMK_webserver22008"></a> Create and issue the web server certificate template on the certification authority

This procedure creates a certificate template for Configuration Manager site systems and adds it to the certification authority.  

##### To create and issue the web server certificate template on the certification authority

1.  Create a security group named **ConfigMgr IIS Servers** that has the member servers to install Configuration Manager site systems that will run IIS.  

2.  On the member server that has Certificate Services installed, in the Certification Authority console, right-click **Certificate Templates** and then choose **Manage** to load the **Certificate Templates** console.  

3.  In the results pane, right-click the entry that has **Web Server** in the **Template Display Name** column, and then choose **Duplicate Template**.  

4.  In the **Duplicate Template** dialog box, ensure that **Windows 2003 Server, Enterprise Edition** is selected, and then choose **OK**.  

    > [!IMPORTANT]  
    >  Do not select **Windows 2008 Server, Enterprise Edition**.  

5.  In the **Properties of New Template** dialog box, on the **General** tab, enter a template name, like **ConfigMgr Web Server Certificate**, to generate the web certificates that will be used on Configuration Manager site systems.  

6.  Choose the **Subject Name** tab, and make sure that **Supply in the request** is selected.  

7.  Choose the **Security** tab, and then remove the **Enroll** permission from the **Domain Admins** and **Enterprise Admins** security groups.  

8.  Choose **Add**, enter **ConfigMgr IIS Servers** in the text box, and then choose **OK**.  

9. Choose the **Enroll** permission for this group, and do not clear the **Read** permission.  

10. Choose **OK**, and then close the **Certificate Templates Console**.  

11. In the Certification Authority console, right-click **Certificate Templates**, choose **New**, and then choose **Certificate Template to Issue**.  

12. In the **Enable Certificate Templates** dialog box, choose the new template that you just created, **ConfigMgr Web Server Certificate**, and then choose **OK**.  

13. If you do not need to create and issue more certificates, close **Certification Authority**.  

###  <a name="BKMK_webserver32008"></a> Request the web server certificate  
 This procedure lets you specify the intranet and internet FQDN values that will be set up in the site system server properties and then installs the web server certificate on to the member server that runs IIS.  

##### To request the web server certificate  

1.  Restart the member server that runs IIS to ensure that the computer can access the certificate template that you created by using the **Read** and **Enroll** permissions that you configured.  

2.  Choose **Start**, choose **Run**, and then type **mmc.exe.** In the empty console, choose **File**, and then choose **Add/Remove Snap-in**.  

3.  In the **Add or Remove Snap-ins** dialog box, choose **Certificates** from the list of **Available snap-ins**, and then choose **Add**.  

4.  In the **Certificate snap-in** dialog box, choose **Computer account**, and then choose **Next**.  

5.  In the **Select Computer** dialog box, ensure that **Local computer: (the computer this console is running on)** is selected, and then choose **Finish**.  

6.  In the **Add or Remove Snap-ins** dialog box, choose **OK**.  

7.  In the console, expand **Certificates (Local Computer)**, and then choose **Personal**.  

8.  Right-click **Certificates**, choose **All Tasks**, and then choose **Request New Certificate**.  

9. On the **Before You Begin** page, choose **Next**.  

10. If you see the **Select Certificate Enrollment Policy** page, choose **Next**.  

11. On the **Request Certificates** page, identify the **ConfigMgr Web Server Certificate** from the list of available certificates, and then choose **More information is required to enroll for this certificate. Click here to configure settings**.  

12. In the **Certificate Properties** dialog box, in the **Subject** tab, do not make any changes to **Subject name**. This means that the **Value** box for the **Subject name** section remains blank. Instead, from the **Alternative name** section, choose the **Type** drop-down list, and then choose **DNS**.  

13. In the **Value** box, specify the FQDN values that you will specify in the Configuration Manager site system properties, and then choose **OK** to close the **Certificate Properties** dialog box.  

     Examples:  

    - If the site system will only accept client connections from the intranet, and the intranet FQDN of the site system server is **server1.internal.contoso.com**, enter **server1.internal.contoso.com**, and then choose **Add**.  

    - If the site system will accept client connections from the intranet and the internet, and the intranet FQDN of the site system server is **server1.internal.contoso.com** and the internet FQDN of the site system server is **server.contoso.com**:  

        1.  Enter **server1.internal.contoso.com**, and then choose **Add**.  

        2.  Enter **server.contoso.com**, and then choose **Add**.  

        > [!NOTE]  
        >  You can specify the FQDNs for Configuration Manager in any order. However, check that all devices that will use the certificate, such as mobile devices and proxy web servers, can use a certificate subject alternative name (SAN) and multiple values in the SAN. If devices have limited support for SAN values in certificates, you might have to change the order of the FQDNs or use the Subject value instead.  

14. On the **Request Certificates** page, choose **ConfigMgr Web Server Certificate** from the list of available certificates, and then choose **Enroll**.  

15. On the **Certificates Installation Results** page, wait until the certificate is installed, and then choose **Finish**.  

16. Close **Certificates (Local Computer)**.  

###  <a name="BKMK_webserver42008"></a> Configure IIS to use the web server certificate  
 This procedure binds the installed certificate to the IIS **Default Web Site**.  

##### To set up IIS to use the web server certificate  

1. On the member server that has IIS installed, choose **Start**, choose **Programs**, choose **Administrative Tools**, and then choose **Internet Information Services (IIS) Manager**.  

2. Expand **Sites**, right-click **Default Web Site**, and then choose **Edit Bindings**.  

3. Choose the **https** entry, and then choose **Edit**.  

4. In the **Edit Site Binding** dialog box, select the certificate that you requested by using the ConfigMgr Web Server Certificates template, and then choose **OK**.  

   > [!NOTE]  
   >  If you are not sure which is the correct certificate, choose one, and then choose **View**. This lets you compare the selected certificate details to the certificates in the Certificates snap-in. For example, the Certificates snap-in shows the certificate template that was used to request the certificate. You can then compare the certificate thumbprint of the certificate that was requested by using the ConfigMgr Web Server Certificates template to the certificate thumbprint of the certificate currently selected in the **Edit Site Binding** dialog box.  

5. Choose **OK** in the **Edit Site Binding** dialog box, and then choose **Close**.  

6. Close **Internet Information Services (IIS) Manager**.  

   The member server is now set up with a Configuration Manager web server certificate.  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  When you install the Configuration Manager site system server on this computer, make sure that you specify the same FQDNs in the site system properties as you specified when you requested the certificate.  

##  <a name="BKMK_clouddp2008_cm2012"></a> Deploy the service certificate for cloud-based distribution points  

This certificate deployment has the following procedures:  

- [Create and issue a custom web server certificate template on the certification authority](#BKMK_clouddpcreating2008)  

- [Request the custom web server certificate](#BKMK_clouddprequesting2008)  

- [Export the custom web server certificate for cloud-based distribution points](#BKMK_clouddpexporting2008)  

###  <a name="BKMK_clouddpcreating2008"></a> Create and issue a custom web server certificate template on the certification authority  
 This procedure creates a custom certificate template that is based on the web server certificate template. The certificate is for Configuration Manager cloud-based distribution points and the private key must be exportable. After the certificate template is created, it is added to the certification authority.  

> [!NOTE]
>  This procedure uses a different certificate template from the web server certificate template that you created for site systems that run IIS. Although both certificates require server authentication capability, the certificate for cloud-based distribution points requires you to enter a custom-defined value for the Subject Name and the private key must be exported. As a security best practice, do not set up certificate templates so that the private key can be exported unless this configuration is required. The cloud-based distribution point requires this configuration because you must import the certificate as a file, rather than choose it from the certificate store.  
> 
>  When you create a new certificate template for this certificate, you can restrict the computers that can request a certificate whose private key can be exported. On a production network, you might also consider adding the following changes for this certificate:  
> 
> - Require approval to install the certificate for additional security.  
>   - Increase the certificate validity period. Because you must export and import the certificate each time before it expires, an increase of the validity period reduces how often you must repeat this procedure. However, an increase of the validity period also decreases the security of the certificate because it provides more time for an attacker to decrypt the private key and steal the certificate.  
>   - Use a custom value in the certificate Subject Alternative Name (SAN) to help identify this certificate from standard web server certificates that you use with IIS.  

##### To create and issue the custom web server certificate template on the certification authority  

1.  Create a security group named **ConfigMgr Site Servers** that has the member servers to install Configuration Manager primary site servers that will manage cloud-based distribution points.  

2.  On the member server that is running the Certification Authority console, right-click **Certificate Templates**, and then choose **Manage** to load the Certificate Templates management console.  

3.  In the results pane, right-click the entry that has **Web Server** in the **Template Display Name** column, and then choose **Duplicate Template**.  

4.  In the **Duplicate Template** dialog box, ensure that **Windows 2003 Server, Enterprise Edition** is selected, and then choose **OK**.  

    > [!IMPORTANT]  
    >  Do not select **Windows 2008 Server, Enterprise Edition**.  

5.  In the **Properties of New Template** dialog box, on the **General** tab, enter a template name, like **ConfigMgr Cloud-Based Distribution Point Certificate**, to generate the web server certificate for cloud-based distribution points.  

6.  Choose the **Request Handling** tab, and then choose **Allow private key to be exported**.  

7.  Choose the **Security** tab, and then remove the **Enroll** permission from the **Enterprise Admins** security group.  

8.  Choose **Add**, enter **ConfigMgr Site Servers** in the text box, and then choose **OK**.  

9. Select the **Enroll** permission for this group, and do not clear the **Read** permission.  

10. Choose the **Cryptography** tab and ensure that **Minimum key size** has been set to **2048**.

11. Choose **OK**, and then close **Certificate Templates Console**.  

12. In the Certification Authority console, right-click **Certificate Templates**, choose **New**, and then choose **Certificate Template to Issue**.  

13. In the **Enable Certificate Templates** dialog box, choose the new template that you just created, **ConfigMgr Cloud-Based Distribution Point Certificate**, and then choose **OK**.  

14. If you do not have to create and issue more certificates, close **Certification Authority**.  

###  <a name="BKMK_clouddprequesting2008"></a> Request the custom web server certificate  
 This procedure requests and then installs the custom web server certificate on the member server that will run the site server.  

##### To request the custom web server certificate  

1.  Restart the member server after you create and configure the **ConfigMgr Site Servers** security group to ensure that the computer can access the certificate template that you created by using the **Read** and **Enroll** permissions that you configured.  

2.  Choose **Start**, choose **Run**, and then enter **mmc.exe.** In the empty console, choose **File**, and then choose **Add/Remove Snap-in**.  

3.  In the **Add or Remove Snap-ins** dialog box, choose **Certificates** from the list of **Available snap-ins**, and then choose **Add**.  

4.  In the **Certificate snap-in** dialog box, choose **Computer account**, and then choose **Next**.  

5.  In the **Select Computer** dialog box, ensure that **Local computer: (the computer this console is running on)** is selected, and then choose **Finish**.

13. In the **Value** box, specify your choice of service name and your domain name by using an FQDN format. For example: **clouddp1.contoso.com**.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  Make the service name unique in your namespace. You will use DNS to create an alias (CNAME record) to map this service name to an automatically generated identifier (GUID) and an IP address from Windows Azure.  

14. Choose **Add**, and then choose **OK** to close the **Certificate Properties** dialog box.  

15. On the **Request Certificates** page, choose **ConfigMgr Cloud-Based Distribution Point Certificate** from the list of available certificates, and then choose **Enroll**.  

16. On the **Certificates Installation Results** page, wait until the certificate is installed, and then choose **Finish**.  

17. Close **Certificates (Local Computer)**.  

###  <a name="BKMK_clouddpexporting2008"></a> Export the custom web server certificate for cloud-based distribution points  
 This procedure exports the custom web server certificate to a file, so that it can be imported when you create the cloud-based distribution point.  

##### To export the custom web server certificate for cloud-based distribution points  

1. In the **Certificates (Local Computer)** console, right-click the certificate that you just installed, choose **All Tasks**, and then choose **Export**.

##  <a name="BKMK_client2008_cm2012"></a> Deploy the client certificate for Windows computers  
 This certificate deployment has the following procedures:  

- Create and issue the Workstation Authentication certificate template on the certification authority  

- Configure autoenrollment of the Workstation Authentication template by using Group Policy  

- Automatically enroll the Workstation Authentication certificate and verify its installation on computers  

###  <a name="BKMK_client02008"></a> Create and issue the Workstation Authentication certificate template on the certification authority  
 This procedure creates a certificate template for Configuration Manager client computers and adds it to the certification authority.  

##### To create and issue the Workstation Authentication certificate template on the certification authority  

1.  On the member server that is running the Certification Authority console, right-click **Certificate Templates**, and then choose **Manage** to load the Certificate Templates management console.

###  <a name="BKMK_client12008"></a> Configure autoenrollment of the Workstation Authentication template by using Group Policy  
 This procedure sets up Group Policy to autoenroll the client certificate on computers.  

##### To set up autoenrollment of the Workstation Authentication template by using Group Policy  

1.  On the domain controller, choose **Start**, choose **Administrative Tools**, and then choose **Group Policy Management**.  

2.  Go to your domain, right-click the domain, and then choose **Create a GPO in this domain, and Link it here**.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  This step uses the best practice of creating a new Group Policy for custom settings rather than editing the Default Domain Policy that is installed with Active Directory Domain Services. When you assign this Group Policy at the domain level, you will apply it to all computers in the domain. In a production environment, you can restrict the autoenrollment so that it enrolls on only selected computers. You can assign the Group Policy at an organizational unit level, or you can filter the domain Group Policy with a security group so that it applies only to the computers in the group. If you restrict autoenrollment, remember to include the server that is set up as the management point.  

3.  In the **New GPO** dialog box, enter a name, like **Autoenroll Certificates**, for the new Group Policy, and then choose **OK**.  

4.  In the results pane, on the **Linked Group Policy Objects** tab, right-click the new Group Policy, and then choose **Edit**.

    The computer is now set up with a Configuration Manager client certificate.  

##  <a name="BKMK_clientdistributionpoint2008_cm2012"></a> Deploy the client certificate for distribution points  

> [!NOTE]  
>  This certificate can also be used for media images that do not use PXE boot, because the certificate requirements are the same.  

 This certificate deployment has the following procedures:  

- Create and issue a custom Workstation Authentication certificate template on the certification authority  

- Request the custom Workstation Authentication certificate  

- Export the client certificate for distribution points  

###  <a name="BKMK_clientdistributionpoint02008"></a> Create and issue a custom Workstation Authentication certificate template on the certification authority  
 This procedure creates a custom certificate template for Configuration Manager distribution points so that the private key can be exported and adds the certificate template to the certification authority.  

> [!NOTE]
>  This procedure uses a different certificate template from the certificate template that you created for client computers. Although both certificates require client authentication capability, the certificate for distribution points requires that the private key is exported. As a security best practice, do not set up certificate templates so the private key can be exported unless this configuration is required. The distribution point requires this configuration because you must import the certificate as a file rather than choose it from the certificate store.  
> 
>  When you create a new certificate template for this certificate, you can restrict the computers that can request a certificate whose private key can be exported. In our example deployment, this will be the security group that you previously created for Configuration Manager site system servers that run IIS. On a production network that distributes the IIS site system roles, consider creating a new security group for the servers that run distribution points so that you can restrict the certificate to just these site system servers. You might also consider adding the following modifications for this certificate:  
> 
> - Require approval to install the certificate for additional security.  
>   - Increase the certificate validity period. Because you must export and import the certificate each time before it expires, an increase of the validity period reduces how often you must repeat this procedure. However, an increase of the validity period also decreases the security of the certificate because it provides more time for an attacker to decrypt the private key and steal the certificate.  
>   - Use a custom value in the certificate Subject field or Subject Alternative Name (SAN) to help identify this certificate from standard client certificates. This can be particularly helpful if you will use the same certificate for multiple distribution points.
