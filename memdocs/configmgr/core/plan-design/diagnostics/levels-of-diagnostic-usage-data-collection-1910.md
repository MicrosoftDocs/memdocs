# Diagnostic and usage data for version 1910

*Applies to: Configuration Manager (current branch)*

The following sections provide additional detail about data collected at each level. For more information on the levels and how to change them, see [Levels of diagnostic usage data](levels-overview.md).

Changes from previous versions are noted with ***[New]***, ***[Updated]***, ***[Removed]***, or ***[Moved]***.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Configuration Manager doesn't collect site codes, sites names, IP addresses, user names, computer names, physical addresses, or email addresses on the Basic or Enhanced levels. Any collection of this information on the Full level is not purposeful. It is potentially included in advanced diagnostic information like log files or memory snapshots. Microsoft doesn't use this information to identify you, contact you, or develop advertising.
