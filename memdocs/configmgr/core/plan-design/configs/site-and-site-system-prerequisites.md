# Site and site system prerequisites for Configuration Manager

*Applies to: Configuration Manager (current branch)*

Windows-based computers require specific configurations to support their use as Configuration Manager site system servers.

For some products, like Windows Server Update Services (WSUS) for the software update point, you need to refer to the product documentation to identify additional prerequisites and limitations for use. Only configurations that directly apply for use with Configuration Manager are included here.

## General requirements and limitations

The following requirements apply to all site system servers:

- Each site system server must use a 64-bit OS. The only exception is the distribution point site system role, which you can install on some 32-bit operating systems.

- Site systems aren't supported on Server Core installations of any OS. An exception is that Server Core installations are supported for the distribution point. For more information, see [Supported operating systems for Configuration Manager site system servers](supported-operating-systems-for-site-system-servers.md).

- After a site system server is installed, it's not supported to change:

  - The domain name of the domain where the site system computer is located (also called a **domain rename**).

  - The domain membership of the computer.

  - The name of the computer.

    If you must change any of these items, first remove the site system role from the computer. Then reinstall the role after the change is complete. For changes affecting the site server, first uninstall the site. Then reinstall the site after the change is complete.

- Site system roles aren't supported on an instance of a Windows Server cluster. The only exception is the site database server. For more information, see [Use a SQL Server Always On failover cluster instance for the site database](../../servers/deploy/configure/use-a-sql-server-cluster-for-the-site-database.md).

    The Configuration Manager setup process doesn't block installation of the site server role on a computer with the Windows role for Failover Clustering. SQL Server Always On availability groups require this role, so previously you couldn't colocate the site database on the site server. With this change, you can create a highly available site with fewer servers by using an availability group and a site server in passive mode. For more information, see [High availability options](../../servers/deploy/configure/high-availability-options.md). <!--3607761, fka 1359132-->

- It's not supported to change the startup type or "Log on as" settings for any Configuration Manager service. If you do, you might prevent key services from running correctly.

## .NET version requirements

<!--28583799-->
Starting in version 2303, site servers and specific site systems require Microsoft .NET Framework version 4.8 Before you run setup to install or update the site, first update .NET and restart the system.

> [!NOTE]
> .NET Framework version 4.6.2 is preinstalled with Windows Server 2016. Later versions of Windows are preinstalled with a later version of the .NET Framework.
>
> .NET Framework version 4.8 is required for 2403 upgrade.
>
> For more information, see [.NET Framework system requirements](/dotnet/framework/get-started/system-requirements).

### Site server

If the site server doesn't have any collocated roles that require .NET, it still requires .NET, but setup doesn't automatically install it. Make sure the site server itself has at least .NET version 4.6.2. If possible, install .NET 4.8.

### Site systems

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you're upgrading from System Center 2012 Configuration Manager R2 Service Pack 1, you need to manually verify that remote site systems have at least .NET version 4.6.2. Configuration Manager current branch setup skips the check in this scenario.<!-- 13846610 -->

During Configuration Manager setup, if site systems have a version earlier than 4.6.2, you'll see a prerequisite check warning. This check is a warning instead of an error, because setup will install version 4.6.2. When .NET updates, it usually requires Windows to restart. Site systems will send status message 4979 when a restart is required. Configuration Manager suppresses the restart; the system doesn't restart automatically.

The behavior will differ for different types of site roles that require .NET:

- The following site system roles support in-place upgrade of .NET. After upgrading .NET, if a restart is required, it sends status message 4979. The role keeps running with the earlier .NET version. After Windows restarts, the role starts using the new .NET version.
  - Asset Intelligence synchronization point
  - Management point
  - Service connection point
  - Data warehouse service point

- The following site systems roles uninstall and reinstall when .NET is upgraded. During site update, site component manager removes the role, and then updates .NET. If a restart is required, it sends status message 4979. After restart, site component manager reinstalls the role with the new .NET version. The role could be unavailable while it waits for you to restart the server.
  - SMS Provider for the administration service
  - Certificate registration point
  - Enrollment point
  - Enrollment proxy point
  - Reporting services point
  - Software update point

> [!NOTE]
> Currently, you still need to enable the Windows feature for .NET Framework 3.5 on site systems that require it.

If site systems have at least version 4.6.2 but earlier than version 4.8, you'll also see a prerequisite check warning. We recommend that you install the latest version of .NET version 4.8 to get the latest performance and security improvements. Configuration Manager setup doesn't automatically install .NET version 4.8. A later version of Configuration Manager will require .NET version 4.8.

There's also a new [management insight](../../servers/manage/management-insights.md) to recommend site systems that don't yet have .NET version 4.8 or later.

### Managing system restarts for .NET updates

Whether you update .NET before updating the site, or set up updates it, .NET may require a restart to complete its installation. After .NET Framework is installed, it may require other updates. These updates may also require the server to restart.

If you need to manage the device restarts before you update the site, use the following recommended process:

1. Install the latest baseline .NET version. For example, install .NET version 4.8.
1. Restart the server.
1. Scan for software updates and install the latest .NET cumulative update.
1. Restart the server.
1. Update the site to the latest current branch version.

## Central administration site and primary site servers

For more information on all prerequisites including permissions, see [Prerequisites for installing a primary site or a CAS](../../servers/deploy/install/prerequisites-for-installing-sites.md#bkmk_PrereqPri). The following sections detail the prerequisite components that you need to install or enable.

- For more information about this requirement, see [Infrastructure requirements for operating system deployment](../../../osd/plan-design/infrastructure-requirements-for-operating-system-deployment.md).

### Windows Server roles and features for the SMS Provider

Web Server (IIS): Every provider attempts to install the [administration service](../../../develop/adminservice/overview.md). This service has a dependency on IIS to bind a certificate to HTTPS port 443. Configuration Manager uses IIS APIs to check this certificate configuration. If you configure the site for [Enhanced HTTP](../hierarchy/enhanced-http.md), Configuration Manager uses IIS APIs to bind the site-generated certificate. Unless the server already has a PKI-based certificate, the site automatically uses the site's self-signed certificate.

### .NET Framework for the SMS Provider

If you're using the [administration service](../../../develop/adminservice/overview.md), the server that hosts the SMS Provider role requires .NET 4.5 or later. <!-- SCCMDocs issue #1203 --> Starting in version 2107, this role requires .NET version 4.6.2, and version 4.8 is recommended. For more information, [.NET version requirements](#net-version-requirements).
