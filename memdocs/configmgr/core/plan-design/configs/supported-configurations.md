# Supported configurations for Configuration Manager

*Applies to: Configuration Manager (current branch)*

As an on-premises solution, Configuration Manager makes use of your servers, clients, network configurations, and additional products like Microsoft Intune, SQL Server, and Azure.

The information in this and the following topics is essential for helping you identify key configurations, requirements, and limitations, so that you can plan, deploy, and maintain a functional Configuration Manager deployment.  This information is specific to the infrastructure for Configuration Manager sites, hierarchies, and managed devices.

When a Configuration Manager feature or capability requires more specific configurations, that information is included with the feature-specific documentation, and is supplemental to the more general configuration details.  

 The products and technologies that are described in the following topics are supported by Configuration Manager. However, their inclusion in this content does not imply an extension of support for any product beyond that product's individual support lifecycle. Products that are beyond their support lifecycle are not supported for use with Configuration Manager, including any products that are covered under the [Extended Security Updates (ESU)](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4497181/lifecycle-faq-extended-security-updates) program. For more information about Microsoft Support Lifecycles, visit the [Microsoft Support Lifecycle](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=208270) website. For more information about Extended Security Updates in Configuration Manager, see [Supported OS versions for clients and devices for Configuration Manager](supported-operating-systems-for-clients-and-devices.md#bkmk_ESU).

> [!NOTE]  
>  For information about Microsoft support lifecycle policy, go to the Microsoft Support Lifecycle Support Policy FAQ website at [Microsoft Support Lifecycle Policy FAQ](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=31976).  

 Additionally, products and product versions that are not listed in the following topics are not supported with Configuration Manager unless they have been announced on the [Enterprise Mobility and Security Blog](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/enterprisemobility/).  At times, the content on this blog precedes an update to this body of documentation.
