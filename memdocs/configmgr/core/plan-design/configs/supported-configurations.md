# Supported configurations for Configuration Manager

*Applies to: Configuration Manager (current branch)*

As an on-premises solution, Configuration Manager makes use of your servers, clients, network configurations, and other products like Microsoft Intune, SQL Server, and Azure.

This information can help you identify key configurations, requirements, and limitations. Use it to plan, deploy, and maintain a functional Configuration Manager deployment. This information is specific to the infrastructure for Configuration Manager sites, hierarchies, and managed devices.

When a Configuration Manager feature or capability requires more specific configurations, see the feature-specific documentation. It's supplemental to the more general configuration details.

The products and technologies described in these articles are supported by Configuration Manager. However, their inclusion in this content doesn't imply an extension of support for any product beyond that product's individual support lifecycle. Products that are beyond their support lifecycle aren't supported for use with Configuration Manager. This statement includes any products that are covered under the [Extended Security Updates (ESU)](/lifecycle/faq/extended-security-updates) program. For more information about Extended Security Updates in Configuration Manager, see [Supported OS versions for clients and devices for Configuration Manager](supported-operating-systems-for-clients-and-devices.md#bkmk_ESU).

> [!NOTE]
> For more general information, see the [Microsoft Support Lifecycle](/lifecycle).
