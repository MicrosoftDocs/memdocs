# Supported OS versions for clients and devices for Configuration Manager

*Applies to: Configuration Manager (current branch)*

Configuration Manager supports installing client software on Windows and macOS computers.  

## General requirements and limitations

Review the following requirements and limitations for all clients:

- Changing the startup type or **Log on as** settings for any Configuration Manager service isn't supported. This change can prevent key services from running correctly.

## Windows computers  

To manage the following Windows OS versions, use the client that's included with Configuration Manager. For more information, see [How to deploy clients to Windows computers](../../clients/deploy/deploy-clients-to-windows-computers.md).  

### Supported client OS versions

- **Windows 10**  

    For more detailed information, see [Support for Windows 10](support-for-windows-10.md).  

- **Windows 8.1** (x86, x64): Professional, Enterprise

#### Windows Virtual Desktop

<!--3556025-->
[Windows Virtual Desktop](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-desktop/) is a desktop and app virtualization service that runs on Microsoft Azure. Starting in version 1906, use Configuration Manager to manage these virtual devices running Windows in Azure.

Similar to a terminal server, some of these virtual devices allow multiple concurrent active user sessions. To help with client performance, Configuration Manager now disables user policies on any device that allows these multiple user sessions. Even if you enable user policies, the client disables them by default on these devices, which include Windows 10 Enterprise multi-session and terminal servers.

The client only disables user policy when it detects this type of device during a new installation. For an existing client of this type that you update to this version, the previous behavior persists. On an existing device, it configures the user policy setting even if it detects that the device allows multiple user sessions.

If you require user policy in this scenario, and accept any potential performance impact, use one of the following methods to enable user policy:

- In version 1910 and later, use [client settings](../../clients/deploy/configure-client-settings.md). In the **Client Policy** group, configure the following setting: **Enable user policy for multiple user sessions**.<!-- 4737447 -->

- In version 1906, use the Configuration Manager SDK with the [SMS_PolicyAgentConfig server WMI class](../../../develop/reference/core/clients/config/sms_policyagentconfig-server-wmi-class.md). Set the new `PolicyEnableUserPolicyOnTS` property to `true`.

> [!Note]  
> You can't use co-management with a client running Windows 10 Enterprise multi-session. <!-- SCCMDocs-pr#3950 -->

## <a name="bkmk_ESU"></a> Extended Security Updates and Configuration Manager

The [Extended Security Updates (ESU)](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4497181/lifecycle-faq-extended-security-updates) program is a last resort option for customers who need to run certain legacy Microsoft products past the end of support. For example, Windows 7. It includes Critical and/or Important security updates (as defined by the [Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC)](https://www.microsoft.com/msrc)) for a maximum of three years after the product's End of Extended Support date.

Products that are beyond their support lifecycle aren't supported for use with Configuration Manager. This includes any products that are covered under the ESU program. Security updates released under the ESU program will be published to Windows Server Update Services (WSUS). These updates will appear in the Configuration Manager console. While products that are covered under the ESU program are no longer supported for use with Configuration Manager, the [latest released version of Configuration Manager current branch](../../servers/manage/updates.md#version-details) can be used to deploy and install Windows security updates released under the program. The latest released version can also be used to deploy Windows 10 to devices running Windows 7.

Client management features not related to Windows software update management or OS deployment will no longer be tested on the operating systems covered under the ESU program and we don't guarantee that they'll continue to function. It's highly recommended to upgrade or migrate to a current version of the operating systems as soon as possible to receive client management support.

## Mac computers  

Manage Apple Mac computers with the Configuration Manager client for macOS.  

The macOS client installation package isn't supplied with the Configuration Manager media. Download it from the Microsoft Download Center, [Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager - macOS Client (64-bit)](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=100850).  

For more information, see [How to deploy clients to Macs](../../clients/deploy/deploy-clients-to-macs.md).  

### Requirements and limitations

- Installing or running the Configuration Manager client for macOS on computers under an account other than root isn't supported. Doing so can prevent key services from running correctly.  

### Supported versions

- **macOS Catalina (10.15)** (requires Configuration Manager site version 1910 or later, and Configuration Manager client for macOS version 5.0.8742.1000 or later)

- **macOS Mojave (10.14)**

- **macOS High Sierra (10.13)**

## Linux and UNIX servers  

> [!Important]  
> Configuration Manager version 1902 drops support for Linux and UNIX as a client. Deprecation was announced with [version 1802](../changes/whats-new-in-version-1802.md#deprecation-announcement-for-linux-and-unix-client-support). Consider Microsoft Azure Management for managing Linux servers. Azure solutions have extensive Linux support that in most cases exceed Configuration Manager functionality, including end-to-end patch management for Linux.

The Linux and UNIX client installation packages aren't supplied with the Configuration Manager media. Download the **Clients for Additional Operating Systems** from the [Microsoft Download Center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=525184). In addition to client installation packages, the client download includes the script that manages the installation of the client on each computer.  

### Requirements and limitations

- To review OS file dependencies for the client for Linux and UNIX, see [Prerequisites for client deployment to Linux and UNIX servers](../../clients/deploy/plan/planning-for-client-deployment-to-linux-and-unix-computers.md#BKMK_ClientDeployPrereqforLnU).  

- For an overview of supported management capabilities for Linux or UNIX, see [How to deploy clients to UNIX and Linux servers](../../clients/deploy/deploy-clients-to-unix-and-linux-servers.md).  

- For supported versions of Linux and UNIX, the listed version includes all subsequent minor versions. For example, CentOS version 6 includes  CentOS 6.3. Similarly, support for an OS that uses service packs (such as SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 11 SP1) includes subsequent service packs for that OS version.  

- For information about client installation packages and the Universal Agent, see [How to deploy clients to UNIX and Linux servers](../../clients/deploy/deploy-clients-to-unix-and-linux-servers.md).
