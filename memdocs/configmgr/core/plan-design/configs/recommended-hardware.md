# Recommended hardware for Configuration Manager

*Applies to: Configuration Manager (current branch)*

The following recommendations are guidelines to help you scale your Configuration Manager environment to support more than a very basic deployment of sites, site systems, and clients. They are not intended to cover all possible site and hierarchy configurations.  

Use the information in the following sections as a guide to help you plan for hardware that can meet the processing loads for clients and sites that use the available Configuration Manager features with the default configurations.  



##  <a name="bkmk_ScaleSieSystems"></a> Site systems  
This section provides recommended hardware configurations for Configuration Manager site systems for deployments that support the maximum number of clients and use most or all Configuration Manager features. Deployments that support less than the maximum number of clients and don't use all available features might require fewer computer resources. In general, the key factors that limit performance of the overall system include the following, in order:  

1.  Disk I/O performance  

2.  Available memory  

3.  CPU  

For best performance, use RAID 10 configurations for all data drives and a 1-Gbps Ethernet network.  

###  <a name="bkmk_ScaleSiteServer"></a> Site servers  

|Site configuration|CPU (cores)|Memory (GB)|Memory allocation for SQL Server (%)|  
|-------------------------------|---------------|---------------|----------------------------------------|  
|Stand-alone primary site server with a database site role on the same server<sup>1</sup>|16|96|80|  
|Stand-alone primary site server with a remote site database|8|16|-|  
|Remote database server for a stand-alone primary site|16|72|90|  
|Central administration site server with a database site role on the same server<sup>1</sup>|20|128|80|  
|Central administration site server with a remote site database|8|16|-|  
|Remote database server for a central administration site|16|96|90|  
|Child primary site with a database site role on the same server|16|96|80|  
|Child primary site server with a remote site database|8|16|-|  
|Remote database server for a child primary site|16|72|90|  
|Secondary site server|8|16|-|  

<sup>1</sup> When the site server and SQL Server are installed on the same computer, the deployment supports the maximum [sizing and scale numbers](size-and-scale-numbers.md) for sites and clients. But, this configuration can limit [high availability options for Configuration Manager](../../servers/deploy/configure/high-availability-options.md), like using a SQL Server cluster. Also, because of the higher I/O requirements that are needed to support both SQL Server and the Configuration Manager site server when you're running both on the same computer, it's a good idea to consider using a configuration with a remote SQL Server machine if you have a larger deployment.  

###  <a name="bkmk_RemoteSiteSystem"></a> Remote site system servers  
The following guidance is for computers that hold a single site system role. Plan to make adjustments when you install multiple site system roles on the same computer.  

|Site system role|CPU (cores)|Memory (GB)|Disk space (GB)|  
|----------------------|---------------|---------------|--------------------|  
|Management point|4|8|50|  
|Distribution point|2|8|As required by the operating system and to store content that you deploy|  
|Software update point<sup>1</sup>|8|16|As required by the operating system and to store updates that you deploy|  
|All other site system roles|4|8|50|  

<sup>1</sup> The computer that hosts a software update point requires the following configurations for IIS application pools:  

- Increase the **WsusPool Queue Length** to **2000**.  

- Increase the **WsusPool Private Memory limit** by four times, or set it to **0** (unlimited).  

###  <a name="bkmk_DiskSpace"></a> Disk space for site systems  
Disk allocation and configuration contributes to the performance of Configuration Manager. Because each Configuration Manager environment is different, the values that you implement can vary from the following guidance.  

For the best performance, place each object on a separate, dedicated RAID volume. For all data volumes (Configuration Manager and its database files), use RAID 10 for the best performance.  

|Data usage|Minimum disk space|25,000 clients|50,000 clients|100,000 clients|150,000 clients|700,000 clients (central administration site)|  
|----------------|------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|---------------------|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|  
|Operating system|See guidance for the operating system.|See guidance for the operating system.|See guidance for the operating system.|See guidance for the operating system.|See guidance for the operating system.|See guidance for the operating system.|  
|Configuration Manager application and log files|25 GB|50 GB|100 GB|200 GB|300 GB|200 GB|  
|Site database .mdf file|75 GB for every 25,000 clients|75 GB|150 GB|300 GB|500 GB|2 TB|  
|Site database .ldf file|25 GB for every 25,000 clients|25 GB|50 GB|100 GB|150 GB|100 GB|  
|Temp database files (.mdf and .ldf)|As needed|As needed|As needed|As needed|As needed|As needed|  
|Content (distribution point shares)|As needed<sup>1</sup>|As needed<sup>1</sup>|As needed<sup>1</sup>|As needed<sup>1</sup>|As needed<sup>1</sup>|As needed<sup>1</sup>|  

<sup>1</sup> The disk space guidance doesn't include the space required for content that is located in the content library on the site server or distribution points. For information about planning for the content library, see [The content library](../../../core/plan-design/hierarchy/the-content-library.md).  

In addition to the preceding guidance, consider the following guidelines when you plan for disk space requirements:  

- Each client requires approximately 5 MB of space.  

- When you plan for the size of the Temp database for a primary site, plan for a combined size that is 25% to 30% of the site database .mdf file. The actual size can be significantly smaller or largerâ€”it depends on the performance of the site server and the volume of incoming data over both short and long periods of time.  

  > [!NOTE]  
  >  When you have 50,000 or more clients at a site, plan to use four or more Temp database .mdf files.  

- The Temp database size for a central administration site is typically much smaller than for a primary site.  

- The secondary site database has the following size limitations:  

  - SQL Server 2012 Express: 10 GB  

  - SQL Server 2014 Express: 10 GB  

##  <a name="bkmk_ScaleClient"></a> Clients  
This section provides recommended hardware configurations for computers that you manage by using Configuration Manager client software.  

### Client for Windows computers  
The following are minimum requirements for Windows-based computers that you manage by using Configuration Manager, including embedded operating systems:  

- **Processor and memory:** Refer to the processor and RAM requirements for the computer operating system.  

- **Disk space:** 500 MB available disk space, with 5 GB recommended for the Configuration Manager client cache. Less disk space is required if you use customized settings to install the Configuration Manager client:  

    - Use the Client.msi property SMSCACHESIZE to set a cache file that is smaller than the default of 5120 MB. The minimum size is 1 MB. For example, `CCMSetup.exe SMSCachesize=2` creates a cache that is 2 MB in size.  

    For more information about these client installation settings, see [About client installation properties](../../../core/clients/deploy/about-client-installation-properties.md).  

    > [!TIP]  
    > Installing the client with minimal disk space is useful for Windows Embedded devices that typically have smaller disk sizes than standard Windows computers.  

The following are additional minimum hardware requirements for optional functionality in Configuration Manager.  

- **Operating system deployment:** 384 MB of RAM  

- **Software Center:** 500 MHz processor  

- **Remote Control:** Pentium 4 Hyper-Threaded 3 GHz (single core) or comparable CPU, with at least a 1 GB RAM for optimal experience  

### Client for Linux and UNIX  
The following are minimum requirements for Linux and UNIX servers that you manage with Configuration Manager.  

|Requirement|Details|  
|-----------------|-------------|  
|Processor and memory|Refer to the processor and RAM requirements for the computer's operating system.|  
|Disk space|500 MB available disk space, with 5 GB recommended for the Configuration Manager client cache.|  
|Network connectivity|Configuration Manager client computers must have network connectivity to Configuration Manager site systems to enable management.|  

##  <a name="bkmk_ScaleConsole"></a> Configuration Manager console  
The requirements in the following table apply to each computer that runs the Configuration Manager console.  

**Minimum hardware configuration:**  

- Intel i3 or comparable CPU  

- 2 GB of RAM

|96 / 100%|1024 x 768|  
|120 /125%|1280 x 960|  
|144 / 150%|1600 x 1200|  
|196 / 200%|2500 x 1600|  

**Support for PowerShell:**  

When you install support for PowerShell on a computer that runs the Configuration Manager console, you can run PowerShell cmdlets on that computer to manage Configuration Manager.

- PowerShell 3.0 or later is supported

In addition to PowerShell, Windows Management Framework (WMF) version 3.0 or later is supported.   


##  <a name="bkmk_ScaleLab"></a> Lab deployments  
Use the following minimum hardware recommendations for lab and test deployments of Configuration Manager. These recommendations apply to all site types, up to 100 clients:  

|Role|CPU (cores)|Memory (GB)|Disk space (GB)|
