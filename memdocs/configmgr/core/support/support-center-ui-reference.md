- Reset warnings. Any warning messages that you previously suppressed appear again when triggered.  
- Reset temporary file path to the default, `%UserProfile%\AppData\Local\Microsoft\ConfigMgrSupportCenter`

#### Exit
Close Support Center.



### <a name="bkmk_support-home"></a> Home tab

#### Collect selected data
Support Center collects information from the Configuration Manager client. By default, it collects the following types:
- Log files
- Client configuration collector
- Operating system

To collect other types of information, select the checkbox next to the name for that type.

Select the drop-down at the bottom of the **Collect selected data** button in the ribbon, and select **Collect all data**. This action collects the complete set of client state data.

While Support Center is collecting data, select **Cancel collection** to stop it.

- **Log files**: Client log files including setup logs  

- **Policy**: Client policy collection  

- **Certificates**: Public key information for client certificates. Support Center doesn't collect certificate private keys.  

- **Client configuration collector**: Configuration Manager client information. You can't disable this data type.  

- **Client registry**: Collects client configuration information from the registry. Support Center only collects Configuration Manager registry information.  

- **Client WMI**: Client configuration information from WMI. Support Center doesn't collect client policy.  

- **Troubleshooting**: Real-time troubleshooting data to help diagnose common client problems with Active Directory, management points, networking, policy assignments, and registration.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > This data type isn't supported when you make a remote connection to another client.  

- **Debug dumps**: Perform debug dump of client and related processes. Debug dumps can be large. Only enable this option when troubleshooting issues with client performance.  

    > [!WARNING]  
    > Collecting debug dumps will cause data bundles to become very large (in some cases, several hundred MB).  
    >  
    > Debug dumps contain may contain sensitive information, including passwords, cryptographic secrets, or user data. Debug dumps should only be collected on the recommendation of Microsoft Support personnel. Data bundles that contain debug dumps should be handled carefully to protect them from unauthorized access.  
    >  
    > This data type isn't supported when you make a remote connection to another client.  

- **Operating system**: Collects configuration information about the local machine. This data includes information about the Windows installation, network adapters, and system service configuration. You can't disable this data type.

### <a name="bkmk_support-logs"></a> Logs tab

This section lists the items on the **Logs** tab of the Support Center tool. 

This tab is almost identical to the **Log Viewer** tool. The **Log Viewer** tool doesn't include the **Configure client logging** and **Log groups** features described in this section.

#### Configure client logging

Set the following options: 
- **Client log level**: Log verbosity and file size  
- **Maximum file count**: Allow more than one log file of a given type  
- **Maximum file size**: The size in bytes of any given log file before the client creates a new log  

> [!NOTE]  
> If you set these values too low, the client may not log any useful information. If you set these values too high, the client logs can consume large amounts of storage.  

#### Log groups

- **Desired Configuration Management**
- **Inventory**
- **Software Distribution**
- **Software Updates**
- **Application Management**
- **Policy**
- **Client Registration**

#### Find previous
After finding two or more matches for the string that you're searching for, this option takes you to the previous match.

#### Options

- **Live updating**: Monitor a currently open log file for changes. This feature doesn't function when multiple log files are open. This option is enabled by default.

- **32-bit integer (unsigned)**: For example, `2147942405`  
- **32-bit hexadecimal**: For example, `0x80070005`  

#### Decode certificate
In the **Decode certificate** dialog box, paste the serialized certificate value for any certificate on the client. Find this value in the registry, in log files, or in WMI. Select **Process** to view general information and details on the certificate. This information includes its certification path. Select **Export** to export the certificate as a **.cer** file.



## <a name="bkmk_adv-filters"></a> Advanced log file filters

Advanced log file filters allow you to include, exclude, or highlight specific strings. These strings can occur in a log file or log file group when looking at log file entries. Use wildcard searches when creating a filter. When you have a useful combination of filters, save them as a *filter set*. 

Advanced log file filters supersede quick filters. Use both together, but quick filters only apply to the displayed log data. Advanced filters determine what data is initially displayed before any it applies any quick filters.

In the Advanced filters dialog, you can create complex filter sets. These filter sets search for strings across many log file components. These components include messages, threads, logging levels, and components. A filter set contains multiple filter statements that you use to include, exclude, or highlight log file messages. A filter defines a log file column to search within, an operator, and a value. The value can contain regular expressions, such as the *wildcard* character `*`.


### Add a filter

1. In the **Log Viewer** window, or on the Support Center **Logs** tab, select **Advanced filters**.  

2. In the Advanced filters dialog, select **Add**. Then select one of the following options to act on log entries that match your filter:  
    - **Include**  
    - **Exclude**  
    - **Highlight**  

3. In the **Advanced filter configuration** dialog, choose a column and an operator:  

    - **Column**: Choose where to look for strings that match your filter:  

         - **Log text**: Search within the text of a log file  

         - **Log severity**: Search for logs with a specific severity level. Set these severity levels in the **Value** field.  

         - **Component**: Search for a specific component by name  

         - **Thread ID**: Search for log messages with a specific thread ID  

         - **Source file**: Search for log messages that occur in a specific log file  

    - **Operator**: Choose an operator for your filter  

4. Enter a value to filter on in the **Value** field. If your value contains regular expressions, select **Enable regular expression matching**.  


### Manage filter sets

- To edit a filter, select the filter, and then select **Edit**.  

- To delete a filter, select the filter, and then select **Delete**.  

- To clear all filters, select **Clear**.  

- To save the current filter set, select **Save filters**. Then save your filter set as a **.filterset** file.
