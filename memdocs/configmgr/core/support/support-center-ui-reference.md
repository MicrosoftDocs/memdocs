# Support Center user interface reference

*Applies to: Configuration Manager (current branch)*

This article is a reference that describes the user interfaces (UI) of the following Support Center tools:

- Support Center Client Data Collector
- Support Center Client Tools
- Support Center Viewer
- Support Center Log File Viewer

> [!NOTE]
> In version 2010 and earlier, the Client Data Collector and Client Tools are combined into a single tool called **Support Center**.<!--8693068-->

The Support Center suite also includes **OneTrace**. For more information, see [Support Center OneTrace](support-center-onetrace.md).

## Support Center Client Data Collector

> [!NOTE]
> In version 2010 and earlier, this tool is part of the **Support Center** tool. The **Collect selected data** action is on the **Home** tab of the **Support Center** tool.

### Window menu (Client Data Collector)

In the upper left corner of the Support Center Client Data Collector window, select the arrow in the blue box to open this menu.

- **Local Machine Connection**: Gather data from the client that's running Support Center Client Data Collector.

- **Remote Connection**: Establish a remote connection with another Configuration Manager client. After connecting, gather data from the remote client.

- **About**: Provides information about Support Center Client Data Collector, such as the version.

- **Options**:

  - Reduce the movement of animated user interface elements
  - Change the default save location for data bundle files
  - Change the location of temporary files
  - Reset warnings. Any warning messages that you previously suppressed appear again when triggered.
  - Reset temporary file path to the default, `%UserProfile%\AppData\Local\Microsoft\ConfigMgrSupportCenter`

- **Exit**: Close Support Center Client Data Collector.

### Home tab

#### Collect selected data

Support Center Client Data Collector collects information from the Configuration Manager client. You can then view this information using [Support Center Viewer](#support-center-viewer). By default, it collects the following types:

- Client log files
- Client configuration collector
- Operating system

To collect other types of information, select the checkbox next to the name for that type.

Select the drop-down at the bottom of the **Collect selected data** button in the ribbon, and select **Collect all data**. This action collects the complete set of client state data.

While Support Center Client Data Collector is collecting data, select **Cancel collection** to stop it.

For more information, see [Support Center quickstart guide](support-center-quickstart.md).

#### Data types

When you select the checkbox for an option, Support Center Client Data Collector collects that type of data the next time you select **Collect selected data**. The following types are available:

- **Log files**: Client log files including setup logs.

- **Policy**: Client policy collection.

- **Certificates**: Public key information for client certificates. Support Center Client Data Collector doesn't collect certificate private keys.

- **Client configuration collector**: Configuration Manager client information. You can't disable this data type.

- **Client registry**: Collects client configuration information from the registry. Support Center Client Data Collector only collects Configuration Manager registry information.

- **Client WMI**: Client configuration information from WMI. Support Center Client Data Collector doesn't collect client policy.

- **Troubleshooting**: Real-time troubleshooting data to help diagnose common client problems with Active Directory, management points, networking, policy assignments, and registration.

    > [!NOTE]
    > This data type isn't supported when you make a remote connection to another client.

- **Debug dumps**: Create a debug dump of client and related processes. Debug dumps can be large. Only enable this option when troubleshooting issues with client performance.

    > [!WARNING]
    > Collecting debug dumps will cause data bundles to become very large. In some cases, the size can be several hundred MB.
    >
    > Debug dumps contain may contain sensitive information, including passwords, cryptographic secrets, or user data. Only collect debug dumps on the recommendation of Microsoft Support personnel. Carefully handle data bundles that contain debug dumps to protect them from unauthorized access.
    >
    > This data type isn't supported when you make a remote connection to another client.

- **Operating system**: Collects configuration information about the local machine. This data includes information about the Windows installation, network adapters, and system service configuration. You can't disable this data type.

Select **Process** to view general information and details on the certificate. This information includes its certification path. Select **Export** to export the certificate as a **.cer** file.

## Advanced log file filters

Advanced log file filters allow you to include, exclude, or highlight specific strings. These strings can occur in a log file or log file group when looking at log file entries. Use wildcard searches when creating a filter. When you have a useful combination of filters, save them as a *filter set*.

Advanced log file filters supersede quick filters. Use both together, but quick filters only apply to the displayed log data. Advanced filters determine what data is initially displayed before any it applies any quick filters.

In the Advanced filters window, you can create complex filter sets. These filter sets search for strings across many log file components. These components include messages, threads, logging levels, and components. A filter set contains multiple filter statements that you use to include, exclude, or highlight log file messages. A filter defines a log file column to search within, an operator, and a value. The value can contain regular expressions, such as the *wildcard* character `*`.

### Add a filter

1. In the Log File Viewer tool, or on the Support Center Client Tools **Logs** tab, select **Advanced filters**.

1. In the Advanced filters window, select **Add**. Then select one of the following options to act on log entries that match your filter:

    - **Include**
    - **Exclude**
    - **Highlight**

1. In the **Advanced filter configuration** window, choose a column and an operator:

    - **Column**: Choose where to look for strings that match your filter:

         - **Log text**: Search within the text of a log file

         - **Log severity**: Search for logs with a specific severity level. Set these severity levels in the **Value** field.

         - **Component**: Search for a specific component by name

         - **Thread ID**: Search for log messages with a specific thread ID

         - **Source file**: Search for log messages that occur in a specific log file

    - **Operator**: Choose an operator for your filter

1. Enter a value to filter on in the **Value** field. If your value contains regular expressions, select **Enable regular expression matching**.

### Manage filter sets

- To edit a filter, select the filter, and then select **Edit**.

- To delete a filter, select the filter, and then select **Delete**.

- To clear all filters, select **Clear**.

- To save the current filter set, select **Save filters**. Then save your filter set as a `.filterset` file.
