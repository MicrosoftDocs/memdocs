# Configuration Manager Tools

*Applies to: Configuration Manager (current branch)*

The Configuration Manager tools primarily include [client-based](#client-tools) and [server-based tools](#server-tools). Use these tools to help support and troubleshoot your Configuration Manager infrastructure.

These tools are included in the `CD.Latest\SMSSETUP\Tools` folder on the site server. No further installation is required.<!--1357145--> Use these versions of the tools with supported versions of Configuration Manager current branch.

All Windows operating systems listed as supported clients in [Supported operating systems for clients and devices](../plan-design/configs/supported-operating-systems-for-clients-and-devices.md) are supported for use with these tools.

> [!NOTE]
> For supported versions of Configuration Manager current branch, use the versions of the tools in the CD.Latest folder on the site server. Some tools were formerly in the toolkit but not included current branch. These legacy tools are no longer supported.

## Client tools

These tools are in the `ClientTools` subfolder:

- [Client Spy](clispy.md): Troubleshoot issues related to software distribution, inventory, and metering

- [Deployment Monitoring Tool](deployment-monitoring-tool.md): Troubleshoot applications, updates, and baseline deployments

- [Policy Spy](policy-spy.md): View policy assignments

- [Power Viewer Tool](power-viewer-tool.md): View status of power management feature

- [Send Schedule Tool](send-schedule-tool.md): Trigger schedules and evaluations of configuration baselines

> [!NOTE]
> The `ClientTools` folder also includes the file Microsoft.Diagnostics.Tracing.EventSource.dll. Several client tools require this library. You can't directly use it.

## Server tools

These tools are in the `ServerTools` subfolder:

- [DP Job Queue Manager](dp-job-manager.md): Troubleshoots content distribution jobs to distribution points

- [Collection Evaluation Viewer](ceviewer.md): View collection evaluation details

  > [!IMPORTANT]
  > Starting in Configuration Manager version 2103, this standalone tool isn't supported.<!-- 8509484 --> The tool is no longer included with the Configuration Manager installation source. Starting in version 2010, its functionality is built-in to the console. For more information, see, [How to view collection evaluation](../clients/manage/collections/collection-evaluation-view.md).

  > Starting in version 2107, RBAViewer has moved from `<installdir>\tools\servertools\rbaviewer.exe`. It's now located in the Configuration Manager console directory. After you install the console, RBAViewer.exe will be in the same directory. The default location is `C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Endpoint Manager\AdminConsole\bin\rbaviewer.exe`.<!--9579789-->
