# Configuration Manager Tools

*Applies to: Configuration Manager (current branch)*

The Configuration Manager tools include [client-based](#client-tools) and [server-based tools](#server-tools). Use these tools to help support and troubleshoot your Configuration Manager infrastructure.

These tools are included in the `CD.Latest\SMSSETUP\Tools` folder on the site server. No further installation is required.<!--1357145--> Use these versions of the tools with supported versions of Configuration Manager current branch.

All Windows operating systems listed as supported clients in [Supported operating systems for clients and devices](../plan-design/configs/supported-operating-systems-for-clients-and-devices.md) are supported for use with these tools.

> [!NOTE]
> The [System Center 2012 R2 Configuration Manager Toolkit](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=50012) is still available from the Microsoft Download Center. For supported versions of Configuration Manager current branch, use the versions of the tools in the CD.Latest folder on the site server. Some tools were formerly in the toolkit but not included current branch. These legacy tools are no longer supported.
