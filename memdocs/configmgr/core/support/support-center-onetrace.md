# Support Center OneTrace

<!--3555962-->

OneTrace is a new log viewer with Support Center. It works similarly to CMTrace, with the following improvements:

- A tabbed view
- Dockable windows
- Improved search capabilities
- Ability to enable filters without leaving the log view
- Scrollbar hints to quickly identify clusters of errors
- Fast log opening for large files
- Windows jump lists for recently opened files (version 2103 and later)

OneTrace works with many types of log files, such as:

- Configuration Manager client logs
- Configuration Manager server logs
- Status messages
- Windows Update ETW log file on Windows 10
- Windows Update log file on Windows 7 & Windows 8.1

## Prerequisites

- .NET Framework version 4.6 or later

## Install

OneTrace installs with Support Center. Find the Support Center installer on the site server at the following path: `cd.latest\SMSSETUP\Tools\SupportCenter\SupportCenterInstaller.msi`.

By default, the OneTrace application is installed at `C:\Program Files (x86)\Configuration Manager Support Center\CMPowerLogViewer.exe`.

> [!NOTE]
> Support Center Log File Viewer and OneTrace use Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF). This component isn't available in Windows PE. Continue to use [CMTrace](cmtrace.md) in boot images with task sequence deployments.

## Log groups

<!--5559993-->

Starting in version 2002, OneTrace supports customizable log groups, similar to the feature in Support Center. Log groups allow you to open all log files for a single scenario. OneTrace currently includes groups for the following scenarios:

- Application management
- Compliance settings (also referred to as Desired Configuration Management)
- Software updates

To show log groups, go to the **View** menu, and select **Log groups**.

### Customize log groups

You can customize these groups by modifying the configuration XML, which by default is in the following path: `C:\Program Files (x86)\Configuration Manager Support Center\LogGroups.xml`.

The following example is one portion of the default configuration file:

``` XML
<LogGroups>
  <LogGroup Name="Desired Configuration Management" GroupType="1" GroupFilePath="">
    <LogFile>CIAgent.log</LogFile>
    <LogFile>CIDownloader.log</LogFile>
    <LogFile>CIStateStore.log</LogFile>
    <LogFile>CIStore.log</LogFile>
    <LogFile>CITaskMgr.log</LogFile>
    <LogFile>ccmsdkprovider.log</LogFile>
    <LogFile>DCMAgent.log</LogFile>
    <LogFile>DCMReporting.log</LogFile>
    <LogFile>DcmWmiProvider.log</LogFile>
  </LogGroup>
</LogGroups>
```

The `GroupType` property accepts the following values:

- `0`: Unknown or other
- `1`: Configuration Manager client logs
- `2`: Configuration Manager server logs

The `GroupFilePath` property can include an explicit path for the log files. If it's blank, OneTrace relies upon the registry configuration for the group type. For example, if you set `GroupType=1`, by default OneTrace will automatically look in `C:\Windows\CCM\Logs` for the logs in the group. In this example, you don't need to specify `GroupFilePath`.

## Open recent files

<!--6991505-->

Starting in version 2103, OneTrace supports Windows jump lists for recently opened files. Jump lists let you quickly go to previously opened files, so you can work faster.

There are three methods to open recent files in OneTrace:

- Windows taskbar jump list
- Windows Start menu recently opened list
- In OneTrace from **File** menu or **Recently opened** tab.

### Windows taskbar jump list

When the OneTrace icon is on the Windows taskbar, right-click it, and then select a file from the **Recently opened** list.

### Windows Start menu recently opened list

Go to the **Start** menu, and type `onetrace`. Select a file from the **Recently opened** list.

### OneTrace recently opened list

There are two locations in OneTrace that show the list of recently opened files:

- The **Recently opened** tab in the lower right corner.
- Go to the **File** menu and select a file at the bottom of the menu.
