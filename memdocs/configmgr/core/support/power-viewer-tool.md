# Power Viewer Tool

*Applies to: Configuration Manager (current branch)*

The Power Viewer tool is one of the [Configuration Manager tools](tools.md). Use it to view the status of the power management feature on a Configuration Manager client.

Run **PowerVwr.exe** as an administrator. When the tool launches, it displays the power capabilities and power settings of the local computer on the **Power Config** tab. 

To view the power management data of a remote computer:  

1. Go to the **File** menu, and click **Connect**. 

2. Enter the **Computer** name, and a **Username** and **Password**, if necessary. 

There are three tabs in Power Viewer:  

- **Power Config**: View the power capabilities and power settings of the targeted computer.  

- **Daily Activity**: View the daily activity charts of the client, which includes the following information:  

    - **Computer on**: The power status of the computer in one day. Sleep mode is considered as power off.  

    - **Monitor on**: On or off status of monitor in one day.  

    - **User Active**: User activity information in one day.  

- **Power Events**: View all of the daily power events. The client summarizes these events at 12:00 AM. This summarization generates data for the daily activity chart.
