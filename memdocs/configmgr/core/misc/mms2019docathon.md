# MMS 2019 Docathon

During the Midwest Management Summit (MMS) 2019, the Microsoft content team for Configuration Manager and Microsoft Intune are running a docathon. If you're attending the [Microsoft Docs hands-on lab](https://sched.co/N6fd) session on Monday, 6 May, that time is to work on contributions with support from the Microsoft writers. The docathon runs the entirety of the conference, and any registered MMS 2019 attendee can participate.

Why should you participate? Microsoft Docs is an open-source platform for Microsoft product documentation powered by GitHub. Microsoft encourages everyone to contribute to the docs! When you contribute, the platform recognizes you in the list of contributors on every article. The following contributions are some of the types that the community can provide:

- Typos
- Clarifications
- Examples
- Real-world guidance and tips
- Content review, freshness

## Set up

If you're not already set up to contribute, do these steps in advance.

### GitHub account

Create a [GitHub account](https://github.com/join)

- Identify any affiliations in your profile  

- Enable two-factor authentication  

#### Additional considerations

- Check your company's policy regarding open-source contributions.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Larger contributions will require that you accept the Microsoft open source [Contributor License Agreement (CLA)](https://cla.opensource.microsoft.com/). Review this agreement in advance.  

- Contributions to Microsoft Docs count toward MVP award consideration.

- Microsoft employees have a few more required one-time steps, and a slightly different contribution process.

For more information, see [GitHub account setup](/contribute/get-started-setup-github) in our contributor guide.

## Scope

This event is only covering the following GitHub repositories:

- [IntuneDocs](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/IntuneDocs)
- [SCCMDocs](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/SCCMdocs)
- [sccm-docs-powershell-ref](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/sccm-docs-powershell-ref)

You're also welcome and encouraged to make changes to other published content, but it won't give credit for this event.

## Learn the process

Read info on [how to file issues](../../../use-docs.md#about-feedback) and [how to contribute](../../../use-docs.md#contribute). Most basic changes can be done through the GitHub browser experience.  

> [!Note]  
> If you're interested in the more complex workflow with git and VSCode, see [Install content authoring tools](/contribute/get-started-setup-tools). And/or ask Aaron/Erik for help. The following actions are some of the reasons why to use the more complex workflow:
>
> - Create a new article
> - Add images
> - String search and replace, including regular expressions
> - Larger, more complex changes  

## Determine your goal(s)

Start thinking about and planning your goal for this event. What do you want to accomplish?

- Look through existing issues in the in-scope repositories. Labels such as **good-first-issue** or **help-wanted** can identify good starting points. If you want to tackle one of these issues, comment on it with **#MMS2019Docathon** and tag the @author, asking that they assign the issue to you. In other words, [call dibs](https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/word-origin-dibs) on it. Repeat this process as many times as you want.

  - For example, in SCCMDocs, where Aaron is the article author: `@aczechowski I'm claiming this issue for #MMS2019Docathon`

- You know of an issue with an article, but there's not yet any feedback filed. In other words, there's nothing in the **Feedback** section at the bottom of the article. File a new issue, then use the same instructions as above to claim it.  

  - For example, add a code sample, a real-world example, or a common tip.

  - Avoid grammar or style changes, unless you talk with Aaron/Erik in advance.

  - Your favorite article has a date older than 90 days, before February 6, 2019. You can review it, and then your edit is to the **ms.date** metadata property. That contribution means: "I reviewed this article, and it's still technically accurate, so refresh the date." File an issue to claim it.

  - Check the article feedback first to make sure there isn't an open issue for someone that's already claimed it. This action isn't technically required. If you don't do it, and someone else submits first, we'll only take the first contribution.

- The one hour lunch session on Monday is dedicated time to work towards these goals. Aaron & Erik are available to help with questions or problems.

## Contest summary

The contest runs all week, 6 - 9 May. Any registered MMS 2019 attendee can participate. Submit entries by 3:00 PM Central on Thursday, May 9, 2019. Prizes will be awarded on Thursday, 9 May, after the [ConfigMgr Product Team Q&A session](https://sched.co/N6ge). You need to be at MMS 2019 to win, but don't need to attend that session. If you're not at the session, to collect a prize, contact Aaron before he leaves Friday morning.

> [!Important]  
> You must include the **#MMS2019Docathon** hashtag in all contributions for credit.
