# Security and privacy for the cloud management gateway

*Applies to: Configuration Manager (current branch)*

This article includes security and privacy information for the Configuration Manager cloud management gateway (CMG). For more information, see [Overview of cloud management gateway](overview.md).

## Security details

The CMG accepts and manages connections from CMG connection points. It uses mutual authentication using certificates and connection IDs.

The CMG accepts and forwards client requests using the following methods:

- Pre-authenticates connections using mutual HTTPS with the PKI-based client authentication certificate or Microsoft Entra ID.

  - IIS on the CMG VM instances verifies the certificate path based on the trusted root certificates that you upload to the CMG.

  - If you enable certificate revocation, IIS on the VM instance also verifies client certificate revocation. For more information, see [Publish the certificate revocation list](#publish-the-certificate-revocation-list).

- The certificate trust list (CTL) checks the root of the client authentication certificate. It also does the same validation as the management point for the client. For more information, see [Review entries in the site's certificate trust list](#review-entries-in-the-sites-certificate-trust-list).

- Validates and filters client requests (URLs) to check if any CMG connection point can service the request.  

- Checks content length for each publishing endpoint.

- Uses round-robin behavior to load-balance CMG connection points in the same site.

The CMG connection point uses the following methods:

- Builds consistent HTTPS/TCP connections to all VM instances of the CMG. It checks and maintains these connections every minute.

- Uses mutual authentication with the CMG using certificates.

- Forwards client requests based on URL mappings.

- Reports connection status to show service health status in the console.

- Reports traffic per endpoint every five minutes.

Configuration Manager rotates the storage account key for the CMG. This process happens automatically every 180 days.<!-- 8613077 -->

### Security mechanisms and protections

The CMG resources in Azure are part of the Azure platform as a service (PaaS). They're protected in the same manner and with the same default protections as all other resources in Azure. It's not supported to change any of the configurations of the CMG resources or architecture in Azure. These changes include the use of any sort of firewall in front the CMG to intercept, filter, or otherwise process traffic before it reaches the CMG. All traffic destined for a CMG is processed through an Azure load balancer. CMG deployments as a virtual machine scale set are protected by Microsoft Defender for Cloud.

#### Service principals and authentication

The service principals are authenticated by the server app registration in Microsoft Entra ID. This app is also known as the _web app_. You create this app registration automatically when you create the CMG, or manually by an Azure administrator in advance. For more information, see [Manually register Microsoft Entra apps for the CMG](manually-register-azure-ad-apps.md).

The secret keys for the Azure apps are encrypted and stored in the Configuration Manager site database. As part of the setup process, the server app has **Read Directory Data** permission to the Microsoft Graph API. It also has the contributor role on the resource group that hosts the CMG. Each time the app needs to access resources like Microsoft Graph, it gets an access token from Azure, which it uses to access the cloud resource.

Microsoft Entra ID can automatically rotate the secret key for these apps, or you can do it manually. When the secret key changes, you need to [renew the secret key](../../../servers/deploy/configure/azure-services-wizard.md#bkmk_renew) in Configuration Manager.

For more information, see [Purpose of app registrations](configure-azure-ad.md#purpose-of-app-registrations).

### Configuration Manager client-facing roles

The management point and software update point host endpoints in IIS to service client requests. The CMG doesn't expose all internal endpoints. Every endpoint published to the CMG has a URL mapping.

- The external URL is the one the client uses to communicate with the CMG.

- The internal URL is the CMG connection point used to forward requests to the internal server.

#### URL-mapping example

When you enable CMG traffic on a management point, Configuration Manager creates an internal set of URL mappings for each management point server. For example: ccm_system, ccm_incoming, and sms_mp. The external URL for the management point ccm_system endpoint might look like:  
`https://<CMG service name>/CCM_Proxy_MutualAuth/<MP Role ID>/CCM_System`  
The URL is unique for each management point. The Configuration Manager client then puts the CMG-enabled management point name into its internet management point list. This name looks like:  
`<CMG service name>/CCM_Proxy_MutualAuth/<MP Role ID>`  
The site automatically uploads all published external URLs to the CMG. This behavior allows the CMG to do URL filtering. All URL mappings replicate to the CMG connection point. It then forwards the communication to internal servers according to the external URL from the client request.

## Security guidance

### Publish the certificate revocation list

Publish your PKI's certificate revocation list (CRL) for internet-based clients to access. When deploying a CMG using PKI, configure the service to **Verify client certificate revocation** on the Settings tab. This setting configures the service to use a published CRL. For more information, see [Plan for PKI certificate revocation](../../../plan-design/security/plan-for-certificates.md#pki-certificate-revocation).

This CMG option verifies the client authentication certificate.

- If the client is using Microsoft Entra ID or Configuration Manager token-based authentication, the CRL doesn't matter.

- If you use PKI, and externally publish the CRL, then enable this option (recommended).

- If you use PKI, don't publish the CRL, then disable this option.

- If you misconfigure this option, it can cause more traffic from clients to the CMG. This traffic can increase the Azure egress data, which can increase your Azure costs.<!-- SCCMDocs#1434 -->

### Review entries in the site's certificate trust list

<!--503739-->
Each Configuration Manager site includes a list of trusted root certification authorities, the certificate trust list (CTL). View and modify the list by going to the **Administration** workspace, expand **Site Configuration**, and select **Sites**. Select a site, and then select **Properties** in the ribbon. Switch to the **Communication Security** tab, and then select **Set** under Trusted Root Certification Authorities.

Use a more restrictive CTL for a site with a CMG using PKI client authentication. Otherwise, clients with client authentication certificates issued by any trusted root that already exists on the management point are automatically accepted for client registration.

This subset provides administrators with more control over security. The CTL restricts the server to only accept client certificates that are issued from the certification authorities in the CTL. For example, Windows ships with certificates for many public and globally trusted certificate providers. By default, the computer running IIS trusts certificates that chain to these well-known certificate authorities (CA). Without configuring IIS with a CTL, any computer that has a client certificate issued from these CAs are accepted as a valid Configuration Manager client. If you configure IIS with a CTL that didn't include these CAs, client connections are refused if the certificate chained to these CAs.

### Enforce TLS 1.2

<!-- SCCMDocs-pr#4021 -->

Use the CMG setting to **Enforce TLS 1.2**. It only applies to the Azure cloud service VM. It doesn't apply to any on-premises Configuration Manager site servers or clients.

Starting in version 2107 with the [update rollup](../../../../hotfix/2107/11121541.md), this setting also applies to the CMG storage account.<!--10800237-->

For more information on TLS 1.2, see [How to enable TLS 1.2](../../../plan-design/security/enable-tls-1-2.md).

### Use token-based authentication

<!--5686290-->

If you have devices that have one or more of the following conditions, consider using Configuration Manager token-based authentication:

- An internet-based device that doesn't often connect to the internal network
- The device isn't able to join Microsoft Entra ID
- You don't have a method to install a PKI-issued certificate

With token-based authentication, the site automatically issues tokens for devices that register on the internal network. You can create a bulk registration token for internet-based devices. For more information, see [Token-based authentication for CMG](../../deploy/deploy-clients-cmg-token.md).<!-- SCCMDocs#2331 -->
