# Monitor cloud management gateway

*Applies to: Configuration Manager (current branch)*

After the cloud management gateway (CMG) is running and clients are connecting through it, you can monitor clients and network traffic to make sure you know how the service is performing.


## Monitor clients

Clients connected through the CMG appear in the Configuration Manager console the same way on-premises clients do. For more information, see [how to monitor clients](../monitor-clients.md).


## Monitor traffic in the console

Monitor traffic on the CMG using the Configuration Manager console:

1. Go to the **Administration** workspace, expand **Cloud Services**, and select the **Cloud Management Gateway** node.  

2. Select the CMG in the list pane.  

3. View the traffic information in the details pane for the CMG connection point and the site system roles it connects to. These statistics show the client requests coming into these roles. The requests include policy, location, registration, content, inventory, and client notifications.<!-- SCCMDocs#1208 -->

## Set up outbound traffic alerts

Outbound traffic alerts help you know when network traffic approaches a 14-day threshold level. When you create the CMG, you can set up traffic alerts. If you skipped that part, you can still set up the alerts after the service is running. Adjust the alert settings at any time.

1. Go to the **Administration** workspace, expand **Cloud Services**, and select the **Cloud Management Gateway** node.  

2. Select the CMG in the list pane, and then select **Properties** in the ribbon.  

3. Go to the **Alerts** tab to enable the threshold and alerts. Specify the 14-day data threshold in gigabytes (GB). Also specify the threshold percentage to raise the different alert levels.  

4. When you're done, select **OK**.  


## Monitor logs

The CMG generates entries in a number of log files. For more information, see [Configuration Manager logs](../../../plan-design/hierarchy/log-files.md#cloud-management-gateway).


## Cloud management dashboard

<!--1358461-->
Starting in version 1806, the cloud management dashboard provides a centralized view for CMG usage. When the site is onboarded to [Azure services](../../../servers/deploy/configure/azure-services-wizard.md) for cloud management, it also displays data about cloud users and devices.  

The following screenshot is a portion of the cloud management dashboard showing two of the available tiles:

In the Configuration Manager console, go to the **Monitoring** workspace. Select the **Cloud Management** node, and view the dashboard tiles.  


## Connection analyzer

Starting in version 1806, use the CMG connection analyzer for real-time verification to aid troubleshooting. The in-console utility checks the current status of the service, and the communication channel through the CMG connection point to any management points that allow CMG traffic.

1. In the Configuration Manager console, go to the **Administration** workspace. Expand **Cloud Services** and select the **Cloud management gateway** node.  

2. Select the target CMG instance, and then select **Connection analyzer** in the ribbon.  

3. In the CMG connection analyzer window, select one of the following options to authenticate with the service:  

     1. **Azure AD user**: use this option to simulate communication the same as a cloud-based user identity signed in to an Azure AD-joined Windows 10 device. Click **Sign In** to securely enter the credentials for this Azure AD user account.  

     2. **Client certificate**: use this option to simulate communication the same as a Configuration Manager client with a [client authentication certificate](certificates-for-cloud-management-gateway.md#bkmk_clientauth).  

4. Select **Start** to start the analysis. The analyzer window displays the results. Select an entry to see more details in the Description field.  


## <a name="bkmk_stop"></a> Stop CMG when it exceeds threshold

<!--3735092-->
Starting in version 1902, Configuration Manager can now stop a CMG service when the total data transfer goes over your limit. Use [alerts](#set-up-outbound-traffic-alerts) to trigger notifications when the usage reaches warning or critical levels. To help reduce any unexpected Azure costs because of a spike in usage, this option turns off the cloud service.

> [!Important]  
> Even if the service isn't running, there are still costs associated with the cloud service. Stopping the service doesn't eliminate all associated Azure costs. To remove all cost for the cloud service, [remove the CMG](setup-cloud-management-gateway.md#modify-a-cmg).  
>
> When the CMG service is stopped, internet-based clients can't communicate with Configuration Manager.  

The total data transfer (egress) includes data from the cloud service and storage account. This data comes from the following flows:

- CMG to client  
- CMG to site, including CMG log files  
- If you enable CMG for content, storage account to client  

For more information on these data flows, see [CMG ports and data flow](plan-cloud-management-gateway.md#ports-and-data-flow).

The storage alert threshold is separate. That alert monitors the capacity of your Azure storage instance.

When you select the CMG instance in the **Cloud Management Gateway** node in the console, you can see the total data transfer in the details pane.

Configuration Manager checks the threshold value every six minutes. If there's a sudden spike in usage, Configuration Manager can take up to six minutes to detect that it exceeded the threshold and then stop the service.

### Process to stop the cloud service when it exceeds threshold

1. [Set up outbound traffic alerts](#set-up-outbound-traffic-alerts).  

2. On the **Alerts** tab of the CMG properties window, enable the option to **Stop this service when the critical threshold is exceeded**.  

To test this feature, temporarily reduce one of the following values:  

- **14-day threshold for outbound data transfer (GB)**. The default value is `10000`.  

- **Percentage of threshold for raising Critical alert**. The default value is `90`.
