# Automatically categorize devices into collections

*Applies to: Configuration Manager (current branch)*

You can create device categories, which can be used to automatically place devices in device collections when you are using Configuration Manager with Microsoft Intune. Users then have to choose a device category when they enroll a device in Intune. You can change a device category from the Configuration Manager console.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>  This capability works with the **June 2016** release of Microsoft Intune and later. Ensure that you have been updated to this release before you try out these procedures.

## Create device categories

1.  Go to **Assets and Compliance** > **Overview** > **Device Collections**.
2.  On the **Home** tab, in the **Device Collections** group, choose **Manage Device Categories**.
3.  Create, edit, or remove categories.

## Associate a collection with a device category

When you associate a collection with a device category, all devices in that category will be added to the collection. You cannot add a device category rule to a built-in collection like **All Systems**.

1.  On the **Membership Rules** tab of the **Properties** dialog box for a device collection, choose **Add Rule** > **Device Category Rule**.
2.  In the **Select Device Categories** dialog box, select one or more device categories that will be applied to all devices in the collection.

## Change the category of a device

1.  In **Assets and Compliance** > **Overview** > **Devices**, select a device from the **Devices** list.
2.  On the **Home** tab, in the **Device** group, choose **Change Category**.
3.  Choose a category, then choose **OK**.

## View which category a device belongs to

In **Assets and Compliance** > **Overview** > **Devices**, in the **Devices** list, the category is displayed in the **Device Category** column.

If the **Device Category** column is not displayed, right-click the heading of one of the columns in the **Devices** list (like **Name**), then select **Device Category**.

If you assign a device to a category, and subsequently delete the category, the report **List of Devices enrolled per user in Microsoft Intune** will display a GUID in the **Device Category** column, instead of a category name.
