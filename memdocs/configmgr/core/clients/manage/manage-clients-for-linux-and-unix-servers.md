# How to manage clients for Linux and UNIX servers in Configuration Manager

*Applies to: Configuration Manager (current branch)*

> [!Important]  
> Starting in version 1902, Configuration Manager doesn't support Linux or UNIX clients. 
> 
> Consider Microsoft Azure Management for managing Linux servers. Azure solutions have extensive Linux support that in most cases exceed Configuration Manager functionality, including end-to-end patch management for Linux.

When you manage Linux and UNIX servers with Configuration Manager, you can configure collections, maintenance windows, and client settings to help manage the servers. Also, though the Configuration Manager client for Linux and UNIX doesn't have a user interface, you can force the client to manually poll for client policy.

##  <a name="BKMK_CollectionsforLnU"></a> Collections of Linux and UNIX servers  
 Use collections to manage groups of Linux and UNIX servers in the same way you use collections to manage other client types. Collections can be direct membership collections or query-based collections. Query-based collections identify client operating systems, hardware configurations, or other details about the client that are stored in the site database. For example, you can use collections that include Linux and UNIX servers to manage the following settings:  

- Client settings  

- Software deployments  

- Enforce maintenance windows  

  Before you can identify a Linux or UNIX client by its operating system or distribution, you must collect [hardware inventory](../../../core/clients/manage/inventory/hardware-inventory-for-linux-and-unix.md) from the client.  

  The default client settings for hardware inventory include information about a client computer's operating system. You can use the **Caption** property of the **Operating System** class to identify the operating system of a Linux or UNIX server.  

  You can view details about computers that run the Configuration Manager client for Linux and UNIX in the **Devices** node of the **Assets and Compliance** workspace in the Configuration Manager console. In the **Asset and Compliance** workspace of the Configuration Manager console, you can view the name of each computer's operating system in the **Operating System** column.  

  By default, Linux and UNIX servers are members of the **All Systems** collection. We recommend that you build custom collections that include only Linux and UNIX servers, or a subset of them. Custom collections enable you to manage operations such as deploying software or assigning client settings to groups of like computers, so that you can accurately measure the success of a deployment.   

  When you build a custom collection for Linux and UNIX servers, include membership rule queries that include the Caption attribute for the Operating System attribute. For information about creating collections, see [How to create collections](../../../core/clients/manage/collections/create-collections.md).  

##  <a name="BKMK_MaintenanceWindowsforLnU"></a> Maintenance windows for Linux and UNIX servers  
 The Configuration Manager client for Linux and UNIX servers supports the use of [maintenance windows](../../../core/clients/manage/collections/use-maintenance-windows.md). This support is unchanged from Windows-based clients.  

##  <a name="BKMK_ClientSettingsforLnU"></a> Client settings for Linux and UNIX servers  
 You can [configure client settings](../../../core/clients/deploy/configure-client-settings.md) that apply to Linux and UNIX servers the same way you configure settings for other clients.  

 By default, the **Default Client Agent Settings** apply to Linux and UNIX servers. You can also create custom client settings and deploy them to collections of specific clients.  

 There are no additional client settings that apply only to Linux and UNIX clients. However, there are default client settings that don't apply to Linux and UNIX clients. The client for Linux and UNIX only applies settings for functionality that it supports.  

 For example, a custom client device setting that enables and configures remote control settings would be ignored by the Linux and UNIX servers, because the client for Linux and UNIX doesn't support remote control.  

##  <a name="BKMK_PolicyforLnU"></a> Computer policy for Linux and UNIX servers  
 The client for Linux and UNIX servers periodically polls its site for computer policy to learn about requested configurations and to check for deployments.  

 You can also force the client on a Linux or UNIX server to immediately poll for computer policy. To do so, use **root** credentials on the server to run the following command: **/opt/microsoft/configmgr/bin/ccmexec -rs policy**  

 Details about the computer policy poll are entered into the shared client log file, **scxcm.log**.  

> [!NOTE]  
>  The Configuration Manager client for Linux and UNIX never requests nor processes user policy.  

##  <a name="BKMK_ManageLinuxCerts"></a> How to manage certificates on the client for Linux and UNIX  
 After you install the client for Linux and UNIX, you can use the **certutil** tool to update the client with a new PKI certificate, and to import a new Certificate Revocation list (CRL). When you install the client for Linux and UNIX, this tool is placed in `/opt/microsoft/configmgr/bin/certutil`. 

 To manage certificates, on each client run certutil with one of the following options:  

|Option|More information|  
|------------|----------------------|  
|`importPFX`|Use this option to specify a certificate to replace the certificate that is currently used by a client.<br /><br /> When you use `-importPFX`, you must also use the `-password` command-line parameter to  supply the password associated with the PKCS#12 file.<br /><br /> Use `-rootcerts` to specify any additional root certificate requirements.<br /><br /> Example: `certutil -importPFX <path to the PKCS#12 certificate> -password <certificate password> [-rootcerts <comma-separated list of certificates>]`|  
|`importsitecert`|Use this option to update the site server signing certificate that is on the management server.<br /><br /> Example: `certutil -importsitecert <path to the DER certificate>`|  
|`importcrl`|Use this option to update the CRL on the client with one or more CRL file paths.<br /><br /> Example: `certutil -importcrl <comma separated CRL file paths>`|
