# Introduction to remote control in Configuration Manager

*Applies to: Configuration Manager (current branch)*

Use remote control to remotely administer, provide assistance, or view any client computer in the hierarchy. You can use remote control to troubleshoot hardware and software configuration problems on client computers and to provide support. Configuration Manager supports the remote control of all workgroup computers and domain-joined computers that run supported operating systems for the Configuration Manager client. For more information, see [Supported operating systems for clients and devices for Configuration Manager](../../../../core/plan-design/configs/supported-operating-systems-for-clients-and-devices.md)

Configuration Manager also lets you configure client settings to run Windows Remote Desktop and Remote Assistance from the Configuration Manager console.  

> [!NOTE]  
>  You cannot establish a Remote Assistance session from the Configuration Manager console to a client computer that is in a workgroup. 

 You can start a remote control session in the Configuration Manager console from **Assets and Compliance** > **Devices**, from any device collection, from the Windows Command Prompt window, or from the Windows **Start** menu.
