 The following two reports are available with the category **Status Messages - Audit**:  

-   **Remote Control - All computers remote controlled by a specific user** - Displays a summary of remote control activity that a specific user initiated.  

-   **Remote Control - All remote control information** - Displays a summary of status messages about remote control of client computers.  

### To run the report Remote Control - All computers remote controlled by a specific user

2.  In the **Monitoring** workspace, expand **Reporting**, and then click **Reports**.  

3.  In the **Reports** node, click the **Category** column to sort the reports so that you can more easily find the reports in the category **Status Messages - Audit**.

5.  In the **User Name** list of the **Remote Control - All computers remote controlled by a specific user**, specify the user that you want to report audit information for, and then click **View Report**.
