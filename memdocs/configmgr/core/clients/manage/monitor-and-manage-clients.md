# Monitor and manage clients in Configuration Manager

*Applies to: Configuration Manager (current branch)*

After you install the client on devices in your organization, Configuration Manager provides several ways to monitor and manage it. You can monitor clients to check their status, and Configuration Manager can automatically fix some problems it detects. Use the Configuration Manager console to manage clients for individual devices or device collections.

- [How to monitor clients](monitor-clients.md)

- [How to manage clients](manage-clients.md)

- [Configure the content cache](configure-client-cache.md)

- [Manage clients on the internet](manage-clients-internet.md)

- [Use collections](collections/introduction-to-collections.md)

Co-management enables you to concurrently manage Windows devices by using both Configuration Manager and Microsoft Intune. It lets you cloud-attach your existing investment in Configuration Manager by adding new functionality. When you enable co-management, you can use Intune for additional client management actions. For more information, see [What is co-management?](../../../comanage/overview.md).
