## Software update health dashboard

You deploy software updates to help secure your environment, but these deployments only reach healthy error free clients. Configuration Manager update errors adversely affect overall compliance. Determining software update errors can be challenging depending upon the error details.

Configuration Manager provides a dashboard with information about the software update deployment status health and common top errors, which most of the devices have in their environment. View your overall software update errors, common errors. 

In the Configuration Manager console, go to the **Monitoring** workspace. Expand **Troubleshooting dashboard**, and select the **software update health** node.
