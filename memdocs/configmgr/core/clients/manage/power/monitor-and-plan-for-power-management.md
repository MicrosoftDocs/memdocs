# How to monitor and plan for power management in Configuration Manager

*Applies to: Configuration Manager (current branch)*

Use the following information to help you monitor and plan for power management in Configuration Manager.  

##  <a name="BKMK_How_to_use_reports"></a> How to use reports for power management  
 Power management in Configuration Manager includes several reports to help you analyze power consumption and computer power settings in your organization. The reports can also be used to help you troubleshoot problems.  

 Before you can use the power management reports, you must configure reporting for your hierarchy. For more information about reporting in Configuration Manager, see [Introduction to reporting](../../../servers/manage/introduction-to-reporting.md).  

> [!NOTE]  
>  Power management information used by daily reports is retained in the Configuration Manager site database for 31 days.  
>           Power management information used by monthly reports is retained in the Configuration Manager site database for 13 months.  
>   
>  When you run reports during the monitoring and planning and compliance phases of power management, save or export the results from any reports for which you want to retain the data for later comparison in case they are later removed by Configuration Manager.  

## List of power management reports  
 The following lists details the power management reports that are available in Configuration Manager.  

> [!NOTE]  
>  Power management reports display the number of physical computers and the number of virtual computers in a selected collection. However, only power management information from physical computers is displayed in power management reports.  

###  <a name="BKMK_Activity"></a> Computer Activity report  
 The **Computer Activity** report displays a graph showing the following activity for a specified collection over a specified period:  

- **Computer On** – The computer has been turned on.  

- **Monitor On** – The monitor has been turned on.  

- **User Active** – Activity has been detected from the computer mouse, computer keyboard, or from a Remote Desktop connection to the computer  

  This report is used during the monitoring and planning and enforcement stages to help you understand the alignment between computer activity, monitor activity and user activity over a 24 hour period. If you run the report over a number of days then the data is aggregated over this period. This report can help you to determine typical business (peak) and nonbusiness (non-peak) hours for a selected collection to help you decide when to apply configured power management plans.  

  The graph shows time periods where a computer might be turned on, but there is no user activity. Consider applying more restrictive power settings during these times to save on the power costs of computers that are turned on, but are not being used. A computer is counted as being active if there has been computer, user or monitor activity for one minute or more for a displayed hour on the graph. If a computer is not reporting power management data, it will not be included in the **Computer Activity** report.  

  Use the following parameters to configure this report.

###  <a name="BKMK_Insomnia"></a> Insomnia report  
 The **Insomnia Report** displays a list of common causes that prevented computers from entering sleep or hibernate and the number of computers affected by each cause for a specified time period. There are a number of causes that might prevent a computer from entering sleep or hibernate such as a process running on the computer, an open Remote Desktop session, or that the computer is incapable of sleep or hibernate. From this report, you can open the **Insomnia Computer Details** report which displays a list of computers affected by each cause of computers not sleeping or hibernating.  

 The Power Insomnia report displays computers as **Not sleep capable** when they are not capable of sleep and have been turned on during the entire specified report interval. The report displays computers as **Not hibernate capable** when they are not capable of hibernate and have been turned on during the entire specified report interval.  

> [!NOTE]

###  <a name="BKMK_Capabilites"></a> Power Capabilities report  
 The **Power Capabilities** report displays the power management hardware capabilities of computers in the specified collection. This report is typically used in the monitoring phase of power management to determine the power management capabilities of computers in your organization. The information displayed in the report can then be used to create collections of computers to apply power plans to, or to exclude from power management. The power management capabilities displayed by this report are:  

- **Sleep Capable** - Indicates whether the computer has the capability to enter sleep if it is configured to do so.  

- **Hibernate Capable** – Indicates whether the computer can enter hibernate if it is configured to do so.  

- **Wake from Sleep** – Indicates whether the computer can wake from sleep if it is configured to do so.  

- **Wake from Hibernate** – Indicates whether the computer can wake from hibernate if it is configured to do so.  

  The values reported by the **Power Capabilities** report indicate the sleep and hibernate capabilities of computers as reported by Windows. However, the reported values do not reflect cases where Windows or BIOS settings prevent these functions from working.  

  Use the following parameters to configure this report.

###  <a name="BKMK_Settings"></a> Power Settings report  
 The **Power Settings** report displays an aggregated list of power settings used by computers in the specified collection. For each power setting, the possible power modes, values, and units are displayed, together with a count of the number of computers that use those values. This report can be used during the monitoring phase of power management to help the administrator understand the existing power settings used by computers in the site and to help plan optimal power settings to be applied by using a power management plan. The report is also useful when troubleshooting to validate that power settings were correctly applied.  

> [!NOTE]
