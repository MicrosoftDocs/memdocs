# Client notification in Configuration Manager

*Applies to: Configuration Manager (current branch)*

To take immediate action on remote clients, send a client notification action from the Configuration Manager console. Start these actions on an individual device or on a collection of devices.

## Actions

The following actions are on the ribbon in the Device or Collection group of the Home tab.

### Install client

Opens the **Install Client Wizard**. This wizard uses client push installation to install a Configuration Manager client. For more information, see [Client push installation](../deploy/deploy-clients-to-windows-computers.md#BKMK_ClientPush).

#### Permissions - Install client

This action requires the **Modify Resource** and **Read** permissions on the **Collection** object.

The following built-in roles have these permissions by default:

- Application Administrator
- Full Administrator
- Infrastructure Administrator
- Operations Administrator
- OS Deployment Manager

Add these permissions to any custom roles that need to push the client.

### Run script

Opens the **Run Script** wizard to run a PowerShell script on all of the clients in the collection. For more information, see [Create and run PowerShell scripts](../../../apps/deploy-use/create-deploy-scripts.md).

#### Permissions - Run script

This action requires the **Run Script** permission on the **Collection** object.

The following built-in roles have this permission by default:

- Full Administrator
- Infrastructure Administrator
- Operations Administrator

Add this permission to any custom roles that need to run scripts.

### Start CMPivot

Starts **CMPivot**, which runs real-time queries against the targeted devices. For more information, see [CMPivot](../../servers/manage/cmpivot.md).

#### Permissions - Start CMPivot

This action requires the **Run CMPivot** permission on the **Collection** object.

## Client notification

These actions are under the **Client notification** menu, on the ribbon in the Device or Collection group of the Home tab. You can start a **Client Notification** from the **Devices** node or within a collection membership view.

> [!Note]
> Starting in version 2203, you can perform client notification actions, including **Run Scripts**, from the **Deployment Status** view. Use the right-click menu on either a group of clients in a **Category** or a single client in the **Asset details** pane to display the client notification actions.<!--7079837-->

#### Permissions - Client notification

<!--SCCMDocs-pr issue #2972-->
Client notification actions require the **Notify Resource** permission on the Collection object. This permission applies to all actions under the **Client notification** menu.

The following built-in roles have this permission by default:

- Full Administrator
- Operations Administrator

Add this permission to any custom roles that need to use client notification actions.

### Download computer policy

Refresh the device policy. For more information, see [Initiate policy retrieval for a Configuration Manager client](manage-clients.md#start-policy-retrieval).

### Download user policy

Refresh the user policy.

### Collect discovery data

Trigger clients to send a discovery data record (DDR). For more information, see [Heartbeat discovery](../../servers/deploy/configure/about-discovery-methods.md#bkmk_aboutHeartbeat).

### Collect software inventory

Trigger clients to run a software inventory cycle. For more information, see [Introduction to software inventory](inventory/introduction-to-software-inventory.md).

### Collect hardware inventory

Trigger clients to run a hardware inventory cycle. For more information, see [Introduction to hardware inventory](inventory/introduction-to-hardware-inventory.md).

### Evaluate application deployments

Trigger clients to run an application deployment evaluation cycle. For more information, see [Schedule re-evaluation for deployments](../deploy/about-client-settings.md#schedule-re-evaluation-for-deployments).

### Evaluate software update deployments

Trigger clients to run a software updates deployment evaluation cycle. For more information, see [Introduction to software updates](../../../sum/understand/software-updates-introduction.md).

### Switch to the next software update point

Trigger clients to switch to the next available software update point. For more information, see [Software update point switching](../../../sum/plan-design/plan-for-software-updates.md#BKMK_SUPSwitching).

### Evaluate device health attestation

Trigger Windows 10 or later clients to check and send their latest device health state. For more information, see [Health attestation](../../servers/manage/health-attestation.md).

### Check Conditional Access compliance

Trigger clients to check compliance for Conditional Access policies. For more information, see [Conditional Access](../../../comanage/quickstart-conditional-access.md).

### Wake Up

Trigger devices configured to support Wake-on-LAN to wake up using other devices on the same subnet to send the Wake-on-LAN package. For more information, see [How to configure Wake on LAN](../deploy/configure-wake-on-lan.md).

### Restart

Trigger the selected devices to restart. For more information, see [Restart clients](manage-clients.md#restart-clients).

## Client diagnostics
<!--4433455-->

Use the following actions to help troubleshoot clients:

- **Enable verbose logging**: Change the global log level for the CCM component to verbose, and enable debug logging.

- **Disable verbose logging**: Change the global log level to default, and disable debug logging.

- **Collect Client Logs**: The site sends a client notification message to the selected clients to gather the CCM logs. The client sends the logs to the management point using the same channel as software inventory file collection. <!--4226618--> You don't need to enable software inventory in client settings.<!-- MEMDocs#305 -->

  - The size limit for the compressed client logs is 100 MB. <!--6366098-->
  - Use [Resource Explorer](inventory/use-resource-explorer-to-view-software-inventory.md#bkmk_diag) manage and view these files.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> - These actions only change the log verbosity, not the size or history. More verbose logging can generate more log content.
> - The management point role also uses the CCM component. If the targeted device is also a management point, this action also applies to that role.

For more information about these settings, see [About log files](../../plan-design/hierarchy/about-log-files.md#client-and-management-point-logging-options).

Track the status of the task in the **diagnostics.log** on the client. When client logs are collected, additional information is logged in **MP_SinvCollFile.log** on the management point and **sinvproc.log** on the site server.

> [!NOTE]
> Starting in version 2107, you can inventory client log file settings such as log levels and size. Enable the hardware inventory class, **Client Diagnostics (CCM_ClientDiagnostics)**. For more information, see [Enable or disable existing hardware inventory classes](inventory/extend-hardware-inventory.md#enable-or-disable-existing-classes).<!--5602449-->

### Prerequisites - Client diagnostics

- Update the target client to the latest version.

- Your Configuration Manager administrative user needs the **Notify resource** permission.

  The following built-in roles have this permission by default:

  - Full Administrator
  - Infrastructure Administrator

  Add this permission to any custom roles that need to use client notification actions.

### Cleanup aged client diagnostic files

<!--6503308-->

Collected client logs are stored according to the software inventory file collection settings. The files are stored on the site server in the **Inboxes\sinv.box\FileCol** directory. There's no defined limit to the number of versions.

The maintenance task to delete aged diagnostic files varies depending on your Configuration Manager version:

- Version 2010 and later uses the **Delete Aged Collected Diagnostic Files** site maintenance task to delete diagnostic files.
- Version 2006 and earlier uses the **Delete Aged Collected Files** site maintenance task to delete diagnostic files.

For more information, see [Reference for maintenance tasks in Configuration Manager](../../servers/manage/reference-for-maintenance-tasks.md#delete-aged-collected-files).

## Endpoint Protection

The following actions are under the **Endpoint Protection** menu. This menu is on the ribbon in the Collection group of the Home tab. When you select one or more devices, these actions are on the **Selected Object** tab of the ribbon.

For more information, see [Endpoint Protection in Configuration Manager](../../../protect/deploy-use/endpoint-protection.md).

### Permissions - Endpoint Protection

This action requires the **Enforce Security** permission on the **Collection** object.

The following built-in roles have this permission by default:

- Full Administrator
- Endpoint Protection Manager
- Operations Administrator

Add this permission to any custom roles that need to trigger Endpoint Protection actions.

### Full Scan

Trigger Endpoint Protection or Windows Defender to run a *full* antimalware scan.

### Quick Scan

Trigger Endpoint Protection or Windows Defender to run a *quick* antimalware scan.

### Download Definition

Trigger Endpoint Protection or Windows Defender to download the latest antimalware definitions.

## Monitor client operations

Monitor the operations sent to clients by using the **Client Operations** node under the **Monitoring** workspace. For some instances, you can cancel the operation by using the **Cancel** option in the ribbon. Use the **Delete** option to remove the operation from the console's view.
