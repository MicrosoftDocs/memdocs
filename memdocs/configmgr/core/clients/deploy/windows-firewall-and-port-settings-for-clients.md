# Windows Firewall and port settings for clients in Configuration Manager

*Applies to: Configuration Manager (current branch)*

Client computers in Configuration Manager that run Windows Firewall often require you to configure exceptions to allow communication with their site. The exceptions that you must configure depend on the management features that you use with the Configuration Manager client.  

 Use the following sections to identify these management features and for more information about how to configure Windows Firewall for these exceptions.  

##  <a name="BKMK_ModifyingWindowsFirewall"></a> Modifying the Ports and Programs Permitted by Windows Firewall  
 Use the following procedure to modify the ports and programs on Windows Firewall for the Configuration Manager client.  

#### To modify the ports and programs permitted by Windows Firewall  

1.  On the computer that runs Windows Firewall, open Control Panel.  

2.  Right-click **Windows Firewall**, and then click **Open**.  

3.  Configure any required exceptions and any custom programs and ports that you require.  

## Programs and Ports that Configuration Manager Requires  
 The following Configuration Manager features require exceptions on the Windows Firewall:  

### Queries  
 If you run the Configuration Manager console on a computer that runs Windows Firewall, queries fail the first time that they are run and the operating system displays a dialog box asking if you want to unblock statview.exe. If you unblock statview.exe, future queries will run without errors. You can also manually add Statview.exe to the list of programs and services on the **Exceptions** tab of the Windows Firewall before you run a query.  

### Client Push Installation  
 To use client push to install the Configuration Manager client, add the following as exceptions to the Windows Firewall:  

-   Outbound and inbound: **File and Printer Sharing**  

-   Inbound: **Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI)**  

### Client Installation by Using Group Policy  
 To use Group Policy to install the Configuration Manager client, add **File and Printer Sharing** as an exception to the Windows Firewall.  

### Client Requests  
 For client computers to communicate with Configuration Manager site systems, add the following as exceptions to the Windows Firewall:  

 Outbound: TCP Port **80** (for HTTP communication)  

 Outbound: TCP Port **443** (for HTTPS communication)  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  These are default port numbers that can be changed in Configuration Manager. For more information, see How to [How to configure client communication ports](../../../core/clients/deploy/configure-client-communication-ports.md). If these ports have been changed from the default values, you must also configure matching exceptions on the Windows Firewall.  

### Client Notification  
 For the management point to notify client computers about an action that it must take when an administrative user selects a client action in the Configuration Manager console, such as download computer policy or initiate a malware scan, add the following as an exception to the Windows Firewall:  

 Outbound: TCP Port **10123**  

 If this communication does not succeed, Configuration Manager automatically falls back to using the existing client-to-management point communication port of HTTP, or HTTPS:  

 Outbound: TCP Port **80** (for HTTP communication)  

 Outbound: TCP Port **443** (for HTTPS communication)  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  These are default port numbers that can be changed in Configuration Manager. For more information, see [How to configure client communication ports](../../../core/clients/deploy/configure-client-communication-ports.md). If these ports have been changed from the default values, you must also configure matching exceptions on the Windows Firewall.  

### Remote Control  
 To use Configuration Manager remote control, allow the following port:  

-   Inbound: TCP Port **2701**  

### Remote Assistance and Remote Desktop  
 To initiate Remote Assistance from the Configuration Manager console, add the custom program **Helpsvc.exe** and the inbound custom port TCP **135** to the list of permitted programs and services in Windows Firewall on the client computer. You must also permit **Remote Assistance** and **Remote Desktop**. If you initiate Remote Assistance from the client computer, Windows Firewall automatically configures and permits **Remote Assistance** and **Remote Desktop**.  

### Wake-Up Proxy  
 If you enable the wake-up proxy client setting, a new service named ConfigMgr Wake-up Proxy uses a peer-to-peer protocol to check whether other computers are awake on the subnet and to wake them up if necessary. This communication uses the following ports:  

 Outbound: UDP Port **25536**  

 Outbound: UDP Port **9**  

 These are the default port numbers that can be changed in Configuration Manager by using the **Power Management** clients settings of **Wake-up proxy port number (UDP)** and **Wake On LAN port number (UDP)**. If you specify the **Power Management**: **Windows Firewall exception for wake-up proxy** client setting, these ports are automatically configured in Windows Firewall for clients. However, if clients run a different firewall, you must manually configure the exceptions for these port numbers.  

 In addition to these ports, wake-up proxy also uses Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) echo request messages from one client computer to another client computer. This communication is used to confirm whether the other client computer is awake on the network. ICMP is sometimes referred to as TCP/IP ping commands.  

 For more information about wake-up proxy, see [Plan how to wake up clients](../../../core/clients/deploy/plan/plan-wake-up-clients.md).  

### Windows Event Viewer, Windows Performance Monitor, and Windows Diagnostics  
 To access Windows Event Viewer, Windows Performance Monitor, and Windows Diagnostics from the Configuration Manager console, enable **File and Printer Sharing** as an exception on the Windows Firewall.  

## Ports Used During Configuration Manager Client Deployment  
 The following tables list the ports that are used during the client installation process.  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  If there is a firewall between the site system servers and the client computer, confirm whether the firewall permits traffic for the ports that are required for the client installation method that you choose. For example, firewalls often prevent client push installation from succeeding because they block Server Message Block (SMB) and Remote Procedure Calls (RPC). In this scenario, use a different client installation method, such as manual installation (running CCMSetup.exe) or Group Policy-based client installation. These alternative client installation methods do not require SMB or RPC.  

 For information about how to configure Windows Firewall on the client computer, see [Modifying the Ports and Programs Permitted by Windows Firewall](#BKMK_ModifyingWindowsFirewall).  

### Ports that are used for all installation methods  

|Description|UDP|TCP|  
|-----------------|---------|---------|  
|Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) from the client computer to a fallback status point, when a fallback status point is assigned to the client.|--|80 (See note 1, **Alternate Port Available**)|  

### Ports that are used with client push installation  
 In addition to the ports listed in the following table, client push installation also uses Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) echo request messages from the site server to the client computer to confirm whether the client computer is available on the network. ICMP is sometimes referred to as TCP/IP ping commands. ICMP does not have a UDP or TCP protocol number, and so it is not listed in the following table. However, any intervening network devices, such as firewalls, must permit ICMP traffic for client push installation to succeed.  

|Description|UDP|TCP|  
|-----------------|---------|---------|  
|Server Message Block (SMB) between the site server and client computer.|--|445|  
|RPC endpoint mapper between the site server and the client computer.|135|135|  
|RPC dynamic ports between the site server and the client computer.|--|DYNAMIC|  
|Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) from the client computer to a management point when the connection is over HTTP.|--|80 (See note 1, **Alternate Port Available**)|  
|Secure Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTPS) from the client computer to a management point when the connection is over HTTPS.|--|443 (See note 1, **Alternate Port Available**)|  

### Ports that are used with software update point-based installation  

|Description|UDP|TCP|  
|-----------------|---------|---------|  
|Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) from the client computer to the software update point.|--|80 or 8530 (See note 2, **Windows Server Update Services**)|  
|Secure Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTPS) from the client computer to the software update point.|--|443 or 8531 (See note 2, **Windows Server Update Services**)|  
|Server Message Block (SMB) between the source server and the client computer when you specify the CCMSetup command-line property **/source:&lt;Path\>**.|--|445|  

### Ports that are used with Group Policy-based installation  

|Description|UDP|TCP|  
|-----------------|---------|---------|  
|Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) from the client computer to a management point when the connection is over HTTP.|--|80 (See note 1, **Alternate Port Available**)|  
|Secure Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTPS) from the client computer to a management point when the connection is over HTTPS.|--|443 (See note 1, **Alternate Port Available**)|  
|Server Message Block (SMB) between the source server and the client computer when you specify the CCMSetup command-line property **/source:&lt;Path\>**.|--|445|  

### Ports that are used with manual installation and logon script-based installation  

|Description|UDP|TCP|  
|-----------------|---------|---------|  
|Server Message Block (SMB) between the client computer and a network share from which you run CCMSetup.exe.<br /><br /> When you install Configuration Manager, the client installation source files are copied and automatically shared from the *&lt;InstallationPath\>*\Client folder on management points. However, you can copy these files and create a new share on any computer on the network. Alternatively, you can eliminate this network traffic by running CCMSetup.exe locally, for example, by using removable media.|--|445|  
|Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) from the client computer to a management point when the connection is over HTTP, and you do not specify the CCMSetup command-line property **/source:&lt;Path\>**.|--|80 (See note 1, **Alternate Port Available**)|  
|Secure Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTPS) from the client computer to a management point when the connection is over HTTPS, and you do not specify the CCMSetup command-line property **/source:&lt;Path\>**.|--|443 (See note 1, **Alternate Port Available**)|  
|Server Message Block (SMB) between the source server and the client computer when you specify the CCMSetup command-line property **/source:&lt;Path\>**.|--|445|  

### Ports that are used with software distribution-based installation  

|Description|UDP|TCP|  
|-----------------|---------|---------|  
|Server Message Block (SMB) between the distribution point and the client computer.|--|445|  
|Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) from the client to a  distribution point when the connection is over HTTP.|--|80 (See note 1, **Alternate Port Available**)|  
|Secure Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTPS) from the client to a distribution point when the connection is over HTTPS.|--|443 (See note 1, **Alternate Port Available**)|  

## Notes  
 **1 Alternate Port Available** In Configuration Manager, you can define an alternate port for this value. If a custom port has been defined, substitute that custom port when you define the IP filter information for IPsec policies or for configuring firewalls.  

 **2 Windows Server Update Services** You can install Windows Server Update Service (WSUS) either on the default Web site (port 80) or a custom Web site (port 8530).  

 After installation, you can change the port. You do not have to use the same port number throughout the site hierarchy.  

 If the HTTP port is 80, the HTTPS port must be 443.  

 If the HTTP port is anything else, the HTTPS port must be 1 higher. For example, 8530 and 8531.
