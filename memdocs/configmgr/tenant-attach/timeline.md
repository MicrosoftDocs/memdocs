# <a name="bkmk_timeline"></a> Tenant attach: Device timeline in the admin center (preview)
<!--CM7141381, IN7552762 pubpreview Sept 8, 2020-->
*Applies to: Configuration Manager (current branch)*

Microsoft Endpoint Manager is an integrated solution for managing all of your devices. Microsoft brings together Configuration Manager and Intune into a single console called **Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center**. When Configuration Manager synchronizes a device to Microsoft Endpoint Manager through tenant attach, you can see a timeline of events. This timeline shows past activity on the device that can help you troubleshoot problems.

## Prerequisites

The following items are needed to use the timeline from the admin center:

- All of the prerequisites for [Tenant attach: ConfigMgr client details](client-details.md#prerequisites).
- A minimum of Configuration Manager version 2002 with the [Update Rollup](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4560496/) and the corresponding version of the console installed.
- Enable Endpoint analytics data collection in Configuration Manager:
   1. In the Configuration Manager console, go to **Administration** > **Client Settings** > **Default Client Settings**.
   1. Right-click and select **Properties** then select the **Computer Agent** settings.
   1. Set **Enable Endpoint analytics data collection** to **Yes**.
      - Only events collected after the client receives this policy will be visible in the admin center. Events prior to receiving the policy won't be accessible.

## Permissions

The user account needs the following permissions:

- The **Read** permission for the device's **Collection** in Configuration Manager.
- The **Read Resource** permission under **Collection** in Configuration Manager.
- The **Notify Resource** permission under **Collection** in Configuration Manager. <!--7984188-->
- An [Intune role](../../intune/fundamentals/role-based-access-control.md) assigned to the user <!--7980141-->

## Generate events

Devices send events once a day to the admin center. Only events collected after the client receives the **Enable Endpoint analytics data collection** policy are visible in the admin center. Generate test events easily by installing an application or an update from Configuration Manager, or restart the device. Events are kept for 30 days. Use the [chart](#collected-events) to view events that are collected.
