# <a name="bkmk_mem"></a> Tenant attach: ConfigMgr client details in the admin center (preview)
<!--6024387, 6374854, 6521921, intune 7552762 pubpreview July 7, 2020-->
*Applies to: Configuration Manager (current branch)*

Microsoft Endpoint Manager is an integrated solution for managing all of your devices. Microsoft brings together Configuration Manager and Intune into a single console called **Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center**. You can see ConfigMgr client details including collections, boundary group membership, and real-time client information for a specific device in the admin center.

> [!Important]
> - This information relates to a preview feature which may be substantially modified before it's commercially released. Microsoft makes no warranties, express or implied, with respect to the information provided here.
> - The boundary groups tab functions only for stand alone sites. The tab will be empty in the admin center for anything other than a standalone primary site.

## Prerequisites

- All of the prerequisites for [Microsoft Endpoint Manager tenant attach](device-sync-actions.md) and a tenant attached environment.
- One of the following browsers:
  - Microsoft Edge, version 77 and later
  - Google Chrome
- The user accounts triggering device actions have the following prerequisites:
   - The user account needs to be a synced user object in Azure AD (hybrid identity). This means that the user is synced to Azure Active Directory from Active Directory.
     - For Configuration Manager version 2103, and later: </br>
   Has been discovered with either [Azure Active Directory user discovery](../core/servers/deploy/configure/about-discovery-methods.md#azureaddisc) or [Active Directory user discovery](../core/servers/deploy/configure/about-discovery-methods.md#bkmk_aboutUser). <!--9089764-->

## Permissions

The user account accessing tenant attach features within the Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center needs the following permissions:

- The **Read** permission for the device's **Collection** in Configuration Manager.
- An [Intune role](../../intune/fundamentals/role-based-access-control.md) assigned to the user <!--7980141-->

## <a name="bkmk_list"></a> List a userâ€™s devices based on usage in the troubleshooting portal
<!--6974300-->
*(Introduced in version 2010)*

The troubleshooting portal in [Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center](https://endpoint.microsoft.com/) allows you to search for a user and view their associated devices. Starting in Configuration Manager version 2010, tenant attached devices that are assigned [user device affinity automatically based on usage](../apps/deploy-use/link-users-and-devices-with-user-device-affinity.md#set-up-the-site-to-automatically-create-user-device-affinities) will now be returned when searching for a user.
### Prerequisites for listing a user's device in the troubleshooting portal

- An environment that's tenant attached with uploaded devices
- Install the latest version of the Configuration Manager client
- Target clients with **User and Device Affinity** [client settings](../core/clients/deploy/about-client-settings.md#user-and-device-affinity) to automatically create the affinities
   - For more information, see [Create user device affinity automatically based on usage](../apps/deploy-use/link-users-and-devices-with-user-device-affinity.md#set-up-the-site-to-automatically-create-user-device-affinities).
### View a user's devices

1. Go to the  [Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center](https://endpoint.microsoft.com/).
1. Select **Troubleshooting + support**.
1. On the **Troubleshoot** page, select **Change user** then search for a user.
1. The **Devices** chart lists the ConfigMgr devices associated with the user.  
   - Devices that previously reported affinity will resend their affinity to reflect in the admin center.
   - Devices that aren't already associated with a user will be updated once the affinity threshold has been met and reported.
