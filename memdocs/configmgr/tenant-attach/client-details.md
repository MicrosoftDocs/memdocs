# <a name="bkmk_mem"></a> Tenant attach: ConfigMgr client details in the admin center (preview)
<!--6024387, 6374854, 6521921, intune 7552762 pubpreview July 7, 2020-->
*Applies to: Configuration Manager (current branch)*

Microsoft Endpoint Manager is an integrated solution for managing all of your devices. Microsoft brings together Configuration Manager and Intune into a single console called **Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center**. You can see ConfigMgr client details including collections, boundary group membership, and real-time client information for a specific device in the admin center.

> [!Important]
> - This information relates to a preview feature which may be substantially modified before it's commercially released. Microsoft makes no warranties, express or implied, with respect to the information provided here.
> - The boundary groups tab functions only for stand alone sites. The tab will be empty in the admin center for anything other than a standalone primary site.

## Prerequisites

- An environment that's [tenant attached with uploaded devices](device-sync-actions.md).
- One of the following browsers:
  - Microsoft Edge, version 77 and later
  - Google Chrome
- The user account has been discovered with both [Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) user discovery](https://docs.microsoft.com/mem/configmgr/core/servers/deploy/configure/about-discovery-methods#azureaddisc) and [Active Directory user discovery](https://docs.microsoft.com/mem/configmgr/core/servers/deploy/configure/about-discovery-methods#bkmk_aboutUser).
  - Meaning the user account needs to be a synced user object in Azure.

## Permissions

The user account needs the following permissions:

- The **Read** permission for the device's **Collection** in Configuration Manager.
- The **Admin User** role for the Configuration Manager Microservice application in Azure AD.
  - Add the role in Azure AD from **Enterprise applications** > **Configuration Manager Microservice** > **Users and groups** > **Add user**. Groups are supported if you have Azure AD premium.
   > [!TIP]
   > The [Application Administrator role in Azure AD](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/users-groups-roles/directory-assign-admin-roles) has sufficient permissions to add a user to the application's **Admin User** role.
