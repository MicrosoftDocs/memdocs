# Tenant attach data collection

*Applies to: Configuration Manager (current branch)*
f
<!-- 6505626 -->
When you attach your Configuration Manager site with a Microsoft Intune tenant, the site sends more data to Microsoft. This article summarizes the data that's sent.

Tenant attach makes the Microsoft Intune admin center your console in the cloud. The architecture allows the Configuration Manager site to synchronize data about the device and the user to your Intune tenant. You can then query and present data from your on-premises environment in the cloud console in real time without active synchronization. It can fetch large volatile data from your on-premises site. Tenant attach uses a mixture of these methods to provide efficient up-to-date information in the cloud console.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Microsoft data handling policies are described in the [Microsoft Intune Privacy Statement](/legal/intune/microsoft-intune-privacy-statement). We only use your customer data to provide you the services you signed up for.
>
> We don't sell any data collected by our service to any third parties for any reason.
>
> The data is all required service data that's needed for the tenant attach connected experience. Required service data includes the following information:
>
> - **Customer content**, which is content you create. For example, the name of your LOB application.
> - **Functional data**, which includes information needed by a connected experience to perform its task. For example, configuration information about the app.
> - **Service diagnostic data**, which is the data necessary to keep the service secure, up to date, and performing as expected. Because this data is strictly related to the connected experience, it's separate from required or optional diagnostic data levels.

The Microsoft Intune family of products collects information that falls into three categories:

- **Identified data**: Most data that Microsoft Intune and Configuration Manager collect is identified data. This data is tied to a user, device, or application and is essential to the nature of management. Identified data is used to manage a user's device and applications.

- **Pseudonymized data**: This data is associated with a unique identifier. It's typically a number generated by the system that on its own can't identify an individual person. The Microsoft Intune family of products use this data to deliver the enterprise service.

- **Aggregated data**: This data is usage statistics such as the number of devices or which controls you use in the Microsoft Intune admin center.

The following sections provide examples of the types of data that tenant attach synchronizes to the cloud. They're grouped by functional entity, so you can review for specific features that you're using.

## Azure Application Insights
<!-- 7544688 -->

The site uploads data to the Azure Application Insights service. Application Insights detects issues for problem solving and continuous application improvement. The following data is sent to this service:

- OS version information for the service connector point
- Site version information
- Site support ID, also known as the hierarchy ID
- Language information
- Azure tenant ID
- Microsoft Entra client ID
- Exceptions and errors that the service connector point generates
- Status events for the service operation

For more information on this service, see [Application Insights API for custom events and metrics](/azure/azure-monitor/app/api-custom-events-metrics). Configuration Manager currently uses the following API methods: `TrackEvent`, `TrackException`, `TrackRequest`, and `TrackTrace`.
