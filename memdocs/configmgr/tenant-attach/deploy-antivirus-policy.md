Microsoft Endpoint Manager is an integrated solution for managing all of your devices. Microsoft brings together Configuration Manager and Intune into a single console called **Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center**. Create Microsoft Defender antivirus policies in the Microsoft Endpoint Manager console and deploy them to Configuration Manager collections.

## Prerequisites

- Access to the [Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center](https://endpoint.microsoft.com/).
- An E5 license for [Microsoft Defender ATP](/windows/security/threat-protection/microsoft-defender-atp/minimum-requirements#licensing-requirements).
- An environment that's [tenant attached with uploaded devices](device-sync-actions.md).
- A minimum of Configuration Manager version 2006 and the corresponding version of the console installed.
   - Upgrade the target devices to the latest version of the Configuration Manager client.
- At least one Configuration Manager collection that's [available for assigning Endpoint security policies](atp-onboard.md#bkmk_collections)

To support managing tamper protection your environment must additionally meet the [prerequisites for managing tamper protection with Intune](/windows/security/threat-protection/microsoft-defender-antivirus/prevent-changes-to-security-settings-with-tamper-protection#turn-tamper-protection-on-or-off-for-your-organization-using-intune) as detailed in the Windows documentation.

To support [firewall](#bkmk_firewall) policies, install [KB4578605](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4578605/) for Configuration Manager version 2006. The update is available in the Configuration Manager console.

## Supported endpoint security profiles for tenant attached devices

## <a name="bkmk_exclusion"></a> Antivirus policy exclusions merge
<!--9089764 -->
*(Introduced in 2103)*

Starting in Configuration Manager 2103, When a tenant attached device is targeted with two or more antivirus policies, the settings for antivirus exclusions will merge before being applied to the client. This change results in the client receiving the exclusions defined in each policy, allowing for more granular control of antivirus exclusions.

For example, an antivirus policy is created from the [Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center](https://endpoint.microsoft.com/) that includes some [antivirus exclusions](../../intune/protect/antivirus-microsoft-defender-settings-windows-tenant-attach.md?toc=/mem/configmgr/tenant-attach/toc.json&bc=/mem/configmgr/tenant-attach/breadcrumb/toc.json#microsoft-defender-antivirus-exclusions). A second antivirus policy is created including only antivirus exclusions that are different from the first policy. Both antivirus policies are then assigned to the same collection. Antivirus exclusions from both policies are applied on clients in the targeted collection.
