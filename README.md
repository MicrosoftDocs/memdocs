# GitHub repository for Microsoft technical documentation

You've found one of the GitHub repositories that houses the source for content published to [Microsoft Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/), home of all technical content for Microsoft's Cloud and Enterprise Division.

## Contribute to your documentation

We **want and encourage contributions** from our community (users, customers, partners, friends on other planets) and Microsoft employees to improve your documentation. Here are some tips:

* **Create a GitHub account**: Sign up for free at [GitHub](https://www.github.com).

* **Use your browser**: There are two options:

    **Option 1: Edit directly from Microsoft Docs**

    1. Browse to the [InTune](/mem/intune) article you want to edit.
    2. Select **Edit** (top right). This shows the markdown file in the GitHub repository.
    3. Select the pencil icon. When you hover over the pencil icon, you'll see the **Edit this file** tooltip.
    4. Make your changes, and then **commit** your changes.
    5. Create the pull request.

    **Option 2: Find the article in this repository, and update**

    1. Most topics are in `https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/memdocs/tree/master/memdocs/intune`. In this folder, search for the topic name, such as `troubleshoot-policies-in-microsoft-intune`.
    2. Select the link, and click the pencil icon. When you hover over the pencil icon, you'll see the **Edit this file** tooltip.
    3. Make your changes, and then **commit** your changes.
    4. Create the pull request.

  When you make an update, you may be prompted to sign a license agreement. This is a one-time task. So any future updates by your GitHub username won't need to sign again. 
  
  The value in the `author` metadata (at the top of every topic) lists the GitHub author. In the `troubleshoot-policies-in-microsoft-intune` example, you'll see `MandiOhlinger`. In your pull request, you can also mention (@*authorValue*) the author if you like.
  
* **MSFT Employees**: After you create a GitHub account, link it to your Microsoft email address. When your account is linked, you don't have to sign a license agreement to make an update. Follow these steps:

  1. On a device with access to corpnet, go to [GitHub account setup](https://review.docs.microsoft.com/en-us/help/contribute/contribute-get-started-setup-github?branch=master). If you're not on corpnet, this link returns a 404.
  
     Creating a GitHub account, and linking to your Microsoft account is a one-time thing. When your account is linked, you don't have to sign a license agreement to make an update.

  2. In your browser, go to the article, and select **Edit**. Switch to the private repo (`IntuneDocs-pr`):

     **From**: `https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/memdocs/...`

     **To**: `https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/memdocs-pr/...`
  
  3. Select the pencil icon, and make your changes.
