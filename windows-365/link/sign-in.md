# Sign in to, sign out, or lock your Windows 365 Link

When you want to use the Windows 365 Link, complete the following steps to sign in:

1. Power on the Windows 365 Link.
2. On the **Sign in** screen, provide your sign in credentials. The device automatically presents you with the sign-in process configured by your organization (FIDO2 security key, Passkey (FIDO2), Microsoft Authenticator app, and so on).
3. Authenticate your account as requested.
4. You're connected to your Cloud PC with all of your context and apps just where you left off

## Sign out

To sign out of your Windows 365 Link:

1. Press control-alt-delete.
1. Select **Sign out**.

## Lock or disconnect your Windows 365 Link

Lock the device by either of these methods:

- Press the **Windows key + L** on your keyboard.
- Select **Start** > **Power** > **Lock**.
- In your Cloud PC, select start > **Power** > **Disconnect**.

The Cloud PC connection persists for 15 minutes (default) after sign-out. Your data and account information aren't stored on the Windows 365 Link. If someone else signs into their account on the Windows 365 Link, the previous user's Cloud PC connection is automatically disconnected.
