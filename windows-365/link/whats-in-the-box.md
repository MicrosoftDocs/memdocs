## Next steps

[First time set up for your Windows 365 Link](setup.md): After unboxing, your Windows 365 Link is brand-new and no users are logged into the device. The device must go through first-time setup, also known as the Out-of-Box Experience (OOBE). Through this setup process, the device is automatically joined to Microsoft Entra and enrolled in Microsoft Intune.
