# What is Windows 365?

Windows 365 is a cloud-based service that automatically creates a new type of Windows virtual machine (Cloud PCs) for your end users. Each Cloud PC is assigned to an individual user and is their dedicated Windows device. Windows 365 provides the productivity, security, and collaboration benefits of Microsoft 365.

Windows 365 is available in multiple editions:

- **Windows 365 Business** is made specifically for use in smaller companies (up to 300 seats) who want ready-to-use Cloud PCs with simple management options. For more information, see [Getting started with Windows 365 Business and Cloud PCs](./business/get-started-windows-365-business.md).
- **Windows 365 Enterprise** is for larger companies who want unlimited seats for creating Cloud PCs. It includes options to create custom Cloud PCs based on device images that you create, more management options, and full integration with Microsoft Intune. For more information, see [What is Windows 365 Enterprise?](./enterprise/overview.md).
- **Windows 365 Government** is a service that spans across a regulated US Government Community Cloud (GCC) and a public facing cloud. For more information, see [What is Windows 365 Government?](./enterprise/introduction-windows-365-government.md)
- **Windows 365 Frontline** helps organizations save costs by providing a single license to provision up to three Cloud PCs for non-concurrent use. These are meant for cases where the user needs Cloud PC access for a limited time per day. For more information, see [What is Windows 365 Frontline?](./enterprise/introduction-windows-365-frontline.md)

To learn about the differences between the Business and Enterprise versions, see [Compare Windows 365 Business and Enterprise](business-enterprise-comparison.md).

## Windows 365 Link

Available now in preview in select markets, Microsoft also offers Windows 365 Link, the first Cloud PC device purpose-built to connect users directly to Windows 365. For more information, see [What is Windows 365 Link?](./link/overview.md).

## Licensing and how to buy

Before your users can gain access to a Cloud PC, you must purchase Windows 365 licenses. Customers can purchase Windows 365 as a separate license per user for a fixed monthly fee to access and use Cloud PCs. Additional costs may apply based on network usage. After licenses are purchased, you can create provisioning policies to automatically create Cloud PCs for users.

For more information, see  [Windows 365 Licensing]( https://www.microsoft.com/licensing/product-licensing/windows-365) and [Windows 365 plans and pricing](https://www.microsoft.com/windows-365/all-pricing?rtc=1).

## Billing

Cloud PCs are billed in a per-user per-month cost model. This model means your organization doesnâ€™t have to manage the variability of compute and storage costs of a traditional hosted desktop model.

## Microsoft 365 Lighthouse

Managed Server Providers (MSPs) can manage Cloud PCs in Microsoft 365 Lighthouse for their customer tenants. For more information, see [Windows 365 (Cloud PCs) page overview](/microsoft-365/lighthouse/m365-lighthouse-win365-page-overview).
