# What is Windows 365?

Windows 365 is a cloud-based service that automatically creates a new type of Windows virtual machine (Cloud PCs) for your end users. Each Cloud PC is assigned to an individual user and is their dedicated Windows device. Windows 365 provides the productivity, security, and collaboration benefits of Microsoft 365.

Windows 365 is available in two editions:

- **Windows 365 Business** is made specifically for use in smaller companies (up to 300 seats) who want ready-to-use Cloud PCs with simple management options. For more information, see [Getting started with Windows 365 Business and Cloud PCs](./business/get-started-windows-365-business.md).
- **Windows 365 Enterprise** is for larger companies who want unlimited seats for creating Cloud PCs. It includes options to create custom Cloud PCs based on device images that you create, more management options, and full integration with Microsoft Endpoint Manager. For more information, see [What is Windows 365 Enterprise?](./enterprise/overview.md).

To learn about the differences between the two versions, see [Compare Windows 365 Business and Enterprise](business-enterprise-comparison.md).

## Billing

Cloud PCs are billed in a per-user per-month cost model. This model means your organization doesn’t have to manage the variability of compute and storage costs of a traditional hosted desktop model.

## Microsoft 365 Lighthouse

Managed Server Providers (MSPs) can manage Cloud PCs in Microsoft 365 Lighthouse for their customer tenants. For more information, see [Windows 365 (Cloud PCs) page overview](/microsoft-365/lighthouse/m365-lighthouse-win365-page-overview).
