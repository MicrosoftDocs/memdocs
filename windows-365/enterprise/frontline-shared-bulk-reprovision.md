# Bulk reprovision Windows 365 Frontline Cloud PCs in shared mode

Windows 365 Frontline Cloud PCs created in shared mode can be reprovisioned in bulk. Any data saved to individual Cloud PCs is removed.

Using bulk actions to reprovision multiple Cloud PCs at a time can help you:

- Apply new configurations. For example, apply a new image.
- Revert all Frontline Cloud PCs in shared mode to a known configuration. This action can help minimize configuration discrepancies that might across your pool of available shared Cloud PCs. Such discrepancies might arise over time when different policies or updates are applied to individual systems.

## Bulk reprovision Frontline Cloud PCs in shared mode

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431), select **Devices** > **Windows 365** (under **Device onboarding**) > **Provisioning policies**.
2. Select a provisioning policy for Frontline Cloud PCs.
3. Select **Reprovision**.
4. In the **Would you like to continue** > **Keep a percentage of devices available** box, type the percentage of the devices you want to keep available during the reprovisioning action. If you set a value more than 0%, reprovisioning rolls out over all the Cloud PCs and always keeps that percentage of Cloud PCs available for use.

    When choosing the percentage, consider the following information:
      - The percentage you set is the number of Cloud PCs that remain available while the rest of the Cloud PCs are reprovisioned. After a number of Cloud PCs equal to the percentage are reprovisioned (and available for use), the previously set aside Cloud PCs start reprovisinoing.
      - The Cloud PCs don't reprovision while users are still signed in. To force disconnection of users, start the reprovision, type 0%, then use the **Restart** remote action on each Cloud PC.
      - The minimum number of devices that will be reprovisioned is one. For example, if you have one Cloud PC and you specify 99%, that one device will still be reprovisioned, even though the closest whole number is one Cloud PC to be available.
      - The system rounds down to the nearest whole number. For example, if the total number of Cloud PCs is 150 and you keep 27% available, the result is 40.5 Cloud PCs. This number is rounded down to keep 40 Cloud PCs available at a time.
