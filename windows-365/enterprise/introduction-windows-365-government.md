# What is Windows 365 Government?

Windows 365 Government is a cloud-based service that automatically creates virtual machines (Cloud PCs) for US government users. This service spans across a regulated US Government Community Cloud (GCC) and a public facing cloud. It meets federal, state, and local US government needs to securely stream Windows apps, data, content, and settings on Cloud PCs from regulated clouds to any device at any time.

Windows 365 Government customers are government agencies or public entities that qualify to use services hosted in GCC and GCC High. The services in the GCC and GCC High clouds must meet specific requirements and pass rigorous audit reviews before customers are allowed to use them.

For GCC environments, users that access Windows 365 Government Cloud PCs have an identity in the public cloud while the underlying resources and content are secured in a regulated US government cloud. GCC customers that don't require underlying resources and content to be secured in a regulated US government cloud can purchase use Windows 365 Enterprise.

Windows 365 Government supports this scenario in a secure, scalable, and transparent manner. It provides flexibility to administrators to manage users in the public cloud, resources in the government cloud, and the dynamic relationship between the two.

Windows 365 Government is available for GCC and GCC High customers in the US, and contractors (in US entities) holding or processing data on behalf of US government agencies.
