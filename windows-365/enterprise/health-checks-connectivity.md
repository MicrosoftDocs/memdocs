# Connectivity health checks

Connectivity health checks are run on individual Cloud PCs and give information on the state of the Cloud PC's connection. These checks run constantly by the Windows 365 service in the backend. When any of these checks fail, the end user wonâ€™t be able to connect to their Cloud PC.

You can review any failed connectivity checks and use the **Troubleshoot this connection** button to troubleshoot.

## View Cloud PC connectivity status

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431) > **Devices** > **Windows 365** > **All Cloud PCs**.
2. Select a Cloud PC in the list > **Overview** > **Performance**.

If the Cloud PC is connected, the status shows as **Available**.

If there's a problem with the Cloud PC's connection due to malfunctioning components, the status shows as **Unavailable**. Select **Troubleshoot this connection** to troubleshoot the issue.

## Connectivity errors

When a connectivity check fails, one of the following messages is shown. To see more details, review the status pane. You can use the **Troubleshoot this connection** button to troubleshoot.

- **DomainJoin**: This Cloud PC isn't joined to a domain.
- **DomainReachable**: This Cloud PC can't connect to the domain. Review your Azure Virtual Network checks.
- **DomainTrust**: The domain doesn't trust this Cloud PC. Make sure the local device password matches the device password in the domain.
- **SxSStackListener**: The side-by-side stack installed on the Cloud PC is malfunctioning or blocked.
- **Unknown**: This Cloud PC might not be running or the network isn't connected to the public Internet.
- **UrlsAccesibleCheck**: This Cloud PC is blocking traffic to [these URLs](requirements.md).

| Check | Failure description | Troubleshooting |
| --- | --- | --- |
| DomainJoin | This Cloud PC isn't joined to a domain. | Try reprovisioning the Cloud PC or join it to a domain. |
| DomainReachable | This Cloud PC can't connect to the domain. | Check for an issue with your virtual network configuration by reviewing your [Azure network connection checks](troubleshoot-azure-network-connection.md). |
| DomainTrust | The domain doesn't trust this Cloud PC. | Make sure that the local device password matches the device password in the domain. |
| SxSStackListener | The side-by-side stack installed on the Cloud PC is malfunctioning or blocked. | Run the troubleshooting tool to fix this issue. |
| Unknown | This Cloud PC might not be running or the network isn't connected to the public Internet. | Run the troubleshooting tool to get more information. |
| UrlsAccesible | This Cloud PC is blocking traffic to [these URLs](requirements.md). | Unblock the URLs this Cloud PC uses to connect to Windows 365. |

If any of these issues persist, contact Microsoft support.

Connectivity errors can occur even when all connectivity health checks successfully passed.

## User connectivity history report

The user connectivity history report shows when a user started a connection and when the connection finished. There are different ways a connection can start/finish and these connections are logged as activities in the report.

### View Connectivity history report

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431) > **Devices** > **Windows 365** > **All Cloud PCs**.
2. Select a Cloud PC in the list > **Overview** > **Performance** > **View report** under **Connectivity status**.

### Activities

The report shows of the following activities:

| Activity | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Connection started | The user successfully connected to their Cloud PC. |
| Connection finished | The user signs out of their Cloud PC or finishes their work session. If the connection fails because of an unexpected network connectivity error, it's listed as a **Connection finished** with a **Failure** status.|
| Connectivity check | If the connection fails because of a failed connectivity check, the failed check is listed. |

Select any activity to get more information about the event.

The connectivity history report provides visibility to other activities within a one hour period of a connectivity error or failed check. As an example, if a user attempts to connect to their Cloud PC, and isn't able to, the health checks and successful sign-in activity within 1 hour prior/after of the error shows as well. This information allows an admin to evaluate an error, possible cause, and if/when the system became healthy again.
