# Delete Azure network connection

Only an unused Azure network connection (ANC) can be deleted.

To delete an unused ANC:

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431) > **Devices** > **Windows 365** (under **Provisioning**) > **Azure network connection**. You must have [Intune Administrator](/azure/active-directory/roles/permissions-reference#intune-administrator) or [Windows 365 Administrator](/azure/active-directory/roles/permissions-reference) permissions.

2. Select the ellipses (**â€¦**) next to the connection you want to delete > **Delete**.
3. Select **Confirm** when asked to delete the connection.

## In use ANCs

ANCs that are in use can't be deleted. In use ANCs include ANCs that are:

- Referenced by a provisioning policy, including as an alternate ANC.
- Used by a Cloud PC.
- Configured as backup ANCs for [cross region disaster recovery](cross-region-disaster-recovery.md).

If an ANC is in use, then you must take one of the following steps before you can delete it:

- Remove the ANC from all provisioning policies.
- Move Cloud PCs to another ANC or deprovision the Cloud PCs.
- Remove the ANC from all cross region disaster recovery user settings.
