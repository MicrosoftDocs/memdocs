# Delete Azure network connection

Only an unassigned Azure network connection (ANC) can be deleted. If an ANC is in use by a provisioning policy, then you must take one of the following steps:

- Remove the ANC from all provisioning policies.
- Delete the ANC.

To delete an Azure network connection:

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431) > **Devices** > **Windows 365** (under **Provisioning**) > **Azure network connection**. You must have [Intune Administrator](/azure/active-directory/roles/permissions-reference#intune-administrator) or [Windows 365 Administrator](/azure/active-directory/roles/permissions-reference) permissions.

2. Select the ellipses (**â€¦**) next to the connection you want to delete > **Delete**.
3. Select **Confirm** when asked to delete the connection.
