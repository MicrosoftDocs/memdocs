# Cloud PC actions report (preview)

This report shows you what actions admins have taken on which Cloud PCs, and the status of those actions.

The Cloud PC actions report is in [public preview](..\public-preview.md).

## Use the Cloud PC actions report

To get to the **Cloud PC actions** report, sign in to [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431), select **Devices** > **Monitor** > **Cloud PC actions (preview)**.

## Report data

- **Primary user UPN**
- **Action**: The following actions are included in the report:
  - Create Snapshot
  - Move Region
  - Place Under Review
  - Power On/Off (W365 Frontline only)
