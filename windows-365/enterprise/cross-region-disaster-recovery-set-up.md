# Set up cross region disaster recovery

[Cross region disaster recovery](cross-region-disaster-recovery.md) is set up as explained in the following steps. For more information about user settings, see [User settings](assign-users-as-local-admin.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> When using cross region disaster recovery, it's critical to configure and test the entire cross region flow as part of your repeating [business continuity adn disaster recovery planning](../business-continuity-disaster-recovery.md). Before releasing widely across your whole environment, you should activate and deactivate multiple test devices to make sure that it's working as expected. You should also periodically your environment is healthy and configured correctly by using the [**Cloud PCs cross region disaster recovery status** report](cross-region-disaster-recovery-report.md).


1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431) > **Devices** > **Windows 365**(under **Device Onboarding**)> **User Settings**.
2. Select **Add** (alternately, you can make the following changes to an existing user setting).
3. On the **Settings** page, type a name in the **Name** box.
4. Set the values under **Point-in-time restore service** per your requirements. These values also apply to cross region disaster recovery.
5. Select **Cross region disaster recovery configuration (Optional)** and then:

    - For **Enable cross region disaster recovery**, select *Yes*.
    - For **Network type**, select an option:
      - **Microsoft-hosted network**: Select the **Geography** and **Region** where your Cloud PC backups are created for cross region disaster recovery.
      - **Azure network connection** (ANC): Your selected ANC determines where the Cloud PC backups are created for cross region disaster recovery. You must configure your ANC for your backup region to support the restored Cloud PCs.

    When configuring a backup location, consider things like data sovereignty and geographic distance between the user and the Cloud PC backup location. The greater the distance between your backup Cloud PC and your userâ€™s connect location increases network latency and impacts performance. Full copies of your Cloud PCs are kept in the backup location, including all data stored on the Cloud PC disk.

6. Select **Next**.
7. On the **Assignments** page, add the groups that you want this user setting applied to. All Cloud PCs associated with a user share the same cross region disaster recovery settings.
8. On the **Review + create** page, select **Create**.

After you finish this configuration, the first backup of the Cloud PC may take several days. To see the current state of backups, check the [Cross region disaster recovery report](cross-region-disaster-recovery-report.md). After the first backup, the recovery point objective (RPO) will be the same as for point-in-time restore plus a few minutes to replicate across regions.
