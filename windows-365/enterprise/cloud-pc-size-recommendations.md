# Cloud PC size recommendations

Windows 365 offers fixed-price licensing (through Microsoft 365) for different Cloud PC sizes. You should assess your business requirements to determine which sizes make sense for your users.  

If extra resources are needed for the Cloud PC, an admin or end user can easily upgrade the size of their Cloud PC. For more information, see [Resize a Cloud PC](resize-cloud-pc.md).  

For information about end-user hardware requirements, see [End-user hardware requirements](..\end-user-hardware-requirements.md).

This table shows examples of the different sizes available for a Cloud PC:

\* The 1vCPU option is being retired. Instead, we recommend the 2vCPU as the minimum configuration for new purchases.

The recommended gallery image is available in the Provisioning Policy marketplace. For more information, see [Device images overview](device-images.md).

## Test performance  

To ensure experience expectations are met, you should test your deployment with simulation tools. You can track the user experience and resource consumption with services like Endpoint Analytics.
