# Cloud PC size recommendations

Windows 365 offers fixed-price licensing (through Microsoft 365) for different Cloud PC sizes. You should assess your business requirements to determine which sizes make sense for your users.  

If extra resources are needed for the Cloud PC, an admin or end user can easily upgrade the size of their Cloud PC. For more information, see [Resize a Cloud PC](resize-cloud-pc.md).  

For information about end-user hardware requirements, see [End-user hardware requirements](..\end-user-hardware-requirements.md).

This table shows examples of the different sizes available for a Cloud PC:
