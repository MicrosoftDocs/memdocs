# Share Cloud PC restore points to an Azure Storage Account

Cloud PC [restore points](restore-overview.md) can be shared to a storage account both singly and in bulk.

You might want to share (move or copy) a Cloud PC and its contents to:

- Create a geographically distributed copy of a Cloud PC.
- Make a copy of a cloud PC during the off-boarding process.
- Get a historical view of a Cloud PC (vs current) for eDiscovery.
- Create a VHD that can be mounted on a physical device.

## Share a single restore point

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431) > **Devices** > **Windows 365** > **All Cloud PCs** > select a device > **Restore points** > select the ellipses (**...**) > **Share**.
1. In the **Share restore point** area, select a **Subscription** and **Storage account**.
1. Select **Share**.

A folder is created in the storage account. The folder name is identical to the Cloud PC name. The folder contains a VHD copy of the Cloud PC device disk.

## Share multiple restore points in bulk

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431) > **Devices** > **All devices** > **Bulk Device Actions**.
