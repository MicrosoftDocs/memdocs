# Windows 365 identity and authentication

A Cloud PC user's identity defines which access management services manage that user and Cloud PC. This identity defines:

- The types of Cloud PCs the user has access to.
- The types of non-Cloud PC resources the user has access to.

A device can also have an identity determined by its join type to Microsoft Entra ID. For a device, the join type defines:

- If the device requires line of sight to a domain controller.
- How the device is managed.
- How users authenticate to the device.

## Identity types

There are four identity types:

- **[Hybrid identity](/entra/identity/hybrid/whatis-hybrid-identity)**: Users or devices that are created in on-premises Active Directory Domain Services, then synchronized to Microsoft Entra ID.
- **Cloud-only identity**: Users or devices that are created and only exist in Microsoft Entra ID.
- **[Federated identity](/entra/identity/devices/device-join-plan#federated-environment)**: Users that are created in a third-party identity provider, other that Microsoft Entra ID or Active Directory Domain Services, then federated with Microsoft Entra ID.
- **[External identity](/entra/external-id/identity-providers)**: Users who are created and managed outside of your Microsoft Entra tenant but are invited in to your Microsoft Entra tenant to access your organization's resources.

>[!NOTE]
>
>- Windows 365 supports federated identities when [single sign-on](#single-sign-on-sso) is enabled.
>- Windows 365 does not support external identities.

## Device join types

There are two join types that you can select from when [provisioning a Cloud PC](provisioning.md):

- **[Microsoft Entra Hybrid Join](/entra/identity/devices/concept-hybrid-join)**: If you choose this join type, Windows 365 joins your Cloud PC to the Windows Server Active Directory domain you provide. Then, if your organization is properly [configured for Microsoft Entra hybrid join](/entra/identity/devices/how-to-hybrid-join), the device is synchronized to Microsoft Entra ID.
- **[Microsoft Entra Join](/entra/identity/devices/concept-directory-join)**: If you choose this join type, Windows 365 joins your Cloud PC directly to Microsoft Entra ID.

The following table shows key capabilities or requirements based on the selected join type:

|Capability or requirement|Microsoft Entra hybrid join|Microsoft Entra join|
|-|-|-|
|Azure subscription|Required|Optional|
|Azure virtual network with line of sight to the domain controller|Required|Optional|
|User identity type supported for login|Hybrid users only|Hybrid users or cloud-only users|
|Policy management|Group Policy Objects (GPO) or Intune MDM|Intune MDM only|
|Windows Hello for Business sign-in supported|Yes, and the connecting device must have line of sight to the domain controller through the direct network or a VPN|Yes|

## Authentication

When a user accesses a Cloud PC, there are three separate authentication phases:

- **Cloud service authentication**: Authenticating to the Windows 365 service, which includes subscribing to resources and authenticating to the Gateway, is with Microsoft Entra ID.
- **Remote session authentication**: Authenticating to the Cloud PC. There are multiple ways to authenticate to the remote session, including the recommended single sign-on (SSO).
- **In-session authentication**: Authenticating to applications and web sites within the Cloud PC.

For the list of credential available on the different clients for each of the authentication phase, [compare the clients across platforms](/azure/virtual-desktop/compare-remote-desktop-clients?pivots=windows-365#authentication).

>[!IMPORTANT]
>In order for authentication to work properly, the user's local machine must also be able to access the URLs in the [Remote Desktop clients](/azure/virtual-desktop/safe-url-list#remote-desktop-clients) section of the [Azure Virtual Desktop required URL list](/azure/virtual-desktop/safe-url-list).

Windows 365 offers single sign-on (defined as a single authentication prompt that can satisfy both the Windows 365 service authentication and Cloud PC authentication) as part of the service. For more information, see [single sign-on](#single-sign-on-sso).

The following sections provide more information on these authentication phases.

### Cloud service authentication

Users must authenticate with the Windows 365 service when:

- They access [windows365.microsoft.com](https://windows365.microsoft.com).
- They navigate to the URL that maps directly to their Cloud PC.
- They use a [supported client](../end-user-access-cloud-pc.md) to list their Cloud PCs.

To access the Windows 365 service, users must first authenticate to the service by signing in with a Microsoft Entra ID account.

#### Multifactor authentication

Follow the instructions in [Set conditional access policies](set-conditional-access-policies.md) to learn how to enforce Microsoft Entra multifactor authentication for your Cloud PCs. That article also tells you how to configure how often your users are prompted to enter their credentials.

#### Passwordless authentication

Users can use any authentication type supported by Microsoft Entra ID, such as [Windows Hello for Business](/windows/security/identity-protection/hello-for-business/hello-overview) and other [passwordless authentication options](/entra/identity/authentication/concept-authentication-passwordless) (for example, FIDO keys), to authenticate to the service.

#### Smart card authentication

To use a smart card to authenticate to Microsoft Entra ID, you must first [configure Microsoft Entra certificate-based authentication](/entra/identity/authentication/concept-certificate-based-authentication) or [configure AD FS for user certificate authentication](/windows-server/identity/ad-fs/operations/configure-user-certificate-authentication).

#### Third-party identity providers

You can use third-party identity providers as long as they [federate with Microsoft Entra ID](/entra/identity/devices/device-join-plan#federated-environment).

### Remote session authentication

If you haven't already enabled [single sign-on](#single-sign-on-sso) and users haven't saved their credentials locally, they also need to authenticate to the Cloud PC when launching a connection.

#### Single sign-on (SSO)

Single sign-on (SSO) allows the connection to skip the Cloud PC credential prompt and automatically sign the user in to Windows through Microsoft Entra authentication. Microsoft Entra authentication provides other benefits including passwordless authentication and support for third-party identity providers. To get started, review the steps to [configure single sign-on](configure-single-sign-on.md).

Without SSO, the client prompts users for their Cloud PC credentials for every connection. The only way to avoid being prompted is to save the credentials in the client. We recommend you only save credentials on secure devices to prevent other users from accessing your resources.

### In-session authentication

After you connect to your Cloud PC, you may be prompted for authentication inside the session. This section explains how to use credentials other than username and password in this scenario.

#### In-session passwordless authentication

Windows 365 supports in-session passwordless authentication using [Windows Hello for Business](/windows/security/identity-protection/hello-for-business/hello-overview) or security devices like FIDO keys when using the [Windows Desktop client](../end-user-access-cloud-pc.md#remote-desktop). Passwordless authentication is enabled automatically when the Cloud PC and local PC are using the following operating systems:

- Windows 11 Enterprise with the [2022-10 Cumulative Updates for Windows 11 (KB5018418)](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/KB5018418) or later installed.
- Windows 10 Enterprise, versions 20H2 or later with the [2022-10 Cumulative Updates for Windows 10 (KB5018410)](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/KB5018410) or later installed.
  
When enabled, all WebAuthn requests in the session are redirected to the local PC. You can use Windows Hello for Business or locally attached security devices to complete the authentication process.

To access Microsoft Entra resources with Windows Hello for Business or security devices, you must enable the FIDO2 Security Key as an authentication method for your users. To enable this method, follow the steps in [Enable FIDO2 security key method](/azure/active-directory/authentication/howto-authentication-passwordless-security-key#enable-fido2-security-key-method).

#### In-session smart card authentication

To use a smart card in your session, make sure you install the smart card drivers on the Cloud PC and allow smart card redirection as part of [managing RDP device redirections for Cloud PCs](manage-rdp-device-redirections.md). Review the [client comparison chart](/azure/virtual-desktop/compare-remote-desktop-clients?pivots=windows-365#in-session-authentication) to make sure your client supports smart card redirection.
