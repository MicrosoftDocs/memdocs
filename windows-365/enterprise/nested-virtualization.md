# Set up virtualization-based workloads support

Virtualization-based workloads let customers use the following systems on their Windows 365 Enterprise Cloud PCs:

- Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)
- Windows Subsystem for Android
- Sandbox
- Hyper-V  

## Requirements

To use virtualization-based workloads, the Cloud PC must meet these requirements:

- 4vCPU or higher Cloud PC (Downsizing to 2vCPU Cloud PCs will disable nested virtualization).
- Be provisioned in one of the [supported regions](requirements.md?tabs=enterprise%2Cent#supported-azure-regions-for-cloud-pc-provisioning) for Windows 365. (Nested virtualization isn't currently supported in South Africa North).
- Some users might experience a decline in their 4vCPU Cloud PC performance when using nested virtualization. For more information on addressing such performance issues, see [Troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md#performance-decreases-with-nested-virtualization).

GPU Cloud PCs don't support nested virtualization.

## Set up virtualization-based workloads

To set up a specific virtualization-based workloads system, see the following articles:

- [Set up a WSL development environment](/windows/wsl/setup/environment).
- [Windows Subsystem for Android™️](/windows/android/wsa/).
- [Install Hyper-V on Windows 10](/virtualization/hyper-v-on-windows/quick-start/enable-hyper-v).

## Next steps

For more information about virtualization-based workloads, see [Run Hyper-V in a Virtual Machine with Nested Virtualization](/virtualization/hyper-v-on-windows/user-guide/nested-virtualization).

If you experience any performance issues with nested virtualization, see [Troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md).
