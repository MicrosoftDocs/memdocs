# Connected Frontline Cloud PCs report (preview)

This report helps you:

- Understand the number of concurrent connections for each Cloud PC size.
- Make sure you have purchased the right number of licenses for your peak usage.

By reviewing the maximum concurrent connections, you can decide if you need to purchase more licenses to ensure your end users aren't blocked from using their Frontline Cloud PCs.

The Connected Frontline Cloud PCs report is in [public preview](..\public-preview.md).
