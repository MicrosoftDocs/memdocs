# Make a user a local admin

The **User settings** page lets IT administrators manage various settings for the user. 

When managing settings, keep the following points in mind:

- The privileges can be applied before or after a Cloud PC is assigned.
- Local administrator permissions apply at the user level.
- The user will have local administrator permissions on all Cloud PCs assigned to them.  
- Changes to the settings take effect when the user logs on. If the user is currently logged on, they must sign out and then sign in again to see the change.

## Add a new setting

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431), select **Devices** > **Windows 365** (under **Provisioning**) > **...** > **User Settings** > **Add**.

## Conflict Resolution for Local Admin

Because user setting policies are assigned to user groups, there’s a possibility of overlap for groups/users. If a user is assigned to more than one user setting policy, user settings will honor the most-recently created policy and ignore all others. The last time a policy was updated doesn't affect this priority. To make sure user settings are consistent and clear, avoid any policy targeting overlaps.
