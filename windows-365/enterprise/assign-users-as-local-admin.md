# User settings

The **User settings** page lets IT administrators manage the following settings for the user:

- **Enable local admin**: If enabled, each user in the assigned groups is elevated to a local administrator of each of their own Cloud PCs. These permissions apply at the user level.
- **Enable users to reset their Cloud PCs**: If enabled, a **Reset** option is shown in the Windows App and portal for users in the assigned groups. Resetting wipes and reprovisions the Cloud PC, deleting all user data and apps.
- **Allow user to initiate restore service**: If enabled, each user in the assigned groups can restore their own Cloud PCs to any available backup version.
- **Cross region disaster recovery configuration (optional)**: Lets you protect Cloud PCs during regional outages. For more information, see [Cross region disaster recovery](cross-region-disaster-recovery.md).

When managing settings, keep the following points in mind:

- The settings can be applied before or after a Cloud PC is assigned.
- Changes to the settings take effect when the user logs on. If the user is currently logged on, they must sign out and then sign in again to see the change.
- User settings don't apply to Windows 365 Frontline Cloud PCs in shared mode.

## Conflict Resolution for Local Admin

Because user setting policies are assigned to user groups, there’s a possibility of overlap for groups/users. If a user is assigned to more than one user setting policy, user settings from the most-recently created policy will be used and ignore all others. The last time a policy was updated doesn't affect this priority. To make sure user settings are consistent and clear, avoid any policy targeting overlaps.
