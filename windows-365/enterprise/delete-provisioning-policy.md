# Delete provisioning policies from Cloud PCs

Only a provisioning policy that has no assignments can be deleted. You can remove assignments by following the steps in [Edit provisioning policy](edit-provisioning-policy.md). After completing those steps, follow the steps below to delete a provisioning policy.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431) > **Devices** > **Windows 365** (under **Provisioning**) > **Provisioning policies**.
