# Cloud PC utilization report (preview)

The Cloud PC utilization report helps you make sure that your licenses are assigned to active users. By reviewing Cloud PCs with low usage, you can decide if a Windows 365 license would better serve other users who might use these resources more often.

## Use the Cloud PC utilization report

To get to the **Cloud PC utilization** report, sign in to [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431), select **Devices** > **Cloud PC performance (preview)** > **View report** (under **Cloud PCs with low utilization**).

## All Cloud PCs tab

On the **All Cloud PCs** tab, the report shows the following data aggregated for the last 28 days:

- This histogram shows user connection time in three sections:
  - **High time connected**: More than 80 hours.
  - **Average time connected**: 40-80 hours.
  - **Low time connected**: Less than 40 hours.
  - **No active time connected**: Zero hours.
- List of individual Cloud PCs with the following columns:
  - **Device name**
  - **Primary user UPN**
  - **PC type**
  - **Total time connected**: The total hours that the user has been connected to the Cloud PC over the last 28 days.
  - **Days since last sign in**

You can use the filter options to see only data for a specific usage group.
