# Windows 365 security

Windows 365 provides an end-to-end connection flow for users to do their work effectively and securely. Windows 365 is built with [Zero Trust](/security/zero-trust/zero-trust-overview) in mind, providing the foundation for you to implement controls to better secure your environment across the 6 pillars of Zero Trust. You can implement Zero Trust controls for the following categories:

- Securing the access to the Cloud PC
    - This aligns with securing the **Identity**, where you can place additional measures on who can access the Cloud PC and under which conditions.
- Securing the Cloud PC device itself
    - This aligns with securing the **Endpoint**, where you can place additional measures on the Cloud PC devices since that is the device being used to access organizational data.
- Securing the Cloud PC data and other data available while using the Cloud PC
    - This aligns with securing the **Data**, where you can place additional measures on the data itself or on how the Cloud PC user access the data.

Take a look at the sections below to better understand the components and features available to you to secure your Cloud PC environment.

## Secure Cloud PC access

The first consideration for securing your environment is to secure access to the Cloud PC.

As described in [identity and authentication](./identity-authentication.md#authentication), there are two authentication challenges to access the Cloud PC:

- The Windows 365 service.
- The Cloud PC.

The primary control for securing access is by using Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) Conditional Access to conditionally grant access to the Windows 365 service. To secure access to the Cloud PC, see [set conditional access policies](./set-conditional-access-policies.md).

## Secure Cloud PC devices

The second consideration for securing your environment is to secure the Cloud PC device itself.

### Security features enabled by default

All new Cloud PCs have the following security components enabled by default:

- **vTPM**: Short for virtual Trusted Platform Module, a vTPM provides Cloud PCs their own dedicate TPM instance that acts as a secure vault for keys and measurements. For more information, see [vTPM](/azure/virtual-machines/trusted-launch#vtpm).
- **Secure Boot**: Secure Boot is a feature that will prevent the Windows operating system from booting if untrusted rootkits or boot kits are installed on the machine. For more information, see [secure boot](/azure/virtual-machines/trusted-launch#secure-boot).

With both security components enabled, Windows 365 supports enabling the following Windows security features:

- [Hypervisor Code Integrity (HVCI)](/windows-hardware/design/device-experiences/oem-hvci-enablement)
- [Microsoft Defender Credential Guard](/windows/security/identity-protection/credential-guard/credential-guard-manage)

### Security features requiring specific Cloud PC SKUs or configuration

The following security components are enabled by default on specific Cloud PC SKUs or configurations:

- **Virtualization-based workloads**
    - **Description**: Virtualization-based workloads typically require the Windows device to enable the Hyper-V feature and run the workloads in an isolated space, to protect the Windows OS from any security threats.
    - **Security features supported**:
        - [Microsoft Defender Application Guard](/windows/security/threat-protection/microsoft-defender-application-guard/md-app-guard-overview)
        - [Windows Sandbox](/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-sandbox/windows-sandbox-overview)
    - **Required configuration**: Cloud PC must have 8 vCPU and 32 GB RAM. See [set up virtualization-based workloads support](nested-virtualization.md#requirements) for more information.

## Secure Cloud PC data

The third consideration for securing your environment is to secure the Cloud PC data and other data that is made available by using the Cloud PC.

### Security of Cloud PC data

The data of the Cloud PC data itself is secured through encryption. For more details, see [data encryption in Windows 365](./encryption.md).

### Security of data available on the Cloud PC

Securing the data available to users on their Cloud PCs should be no different than securing the data available to users on work-assigned Windows PCs, with the caveat that the Cloud PC is being accessed through Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP).

To manage RDP features available to the user during their Cloud PC connection, see [manage RDP device redirections for Cloud PCs](./manage-rdp-device-redirections.md).
