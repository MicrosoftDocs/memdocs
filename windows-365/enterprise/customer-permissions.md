# Customer permissions

For some operations, Windows 365 needs permissions to other services. These operations include:

- Create an Azure network connection (ANC)
- Add a custom image

Windows 365 uses the Azure role-based access control (RBAC) permissions required for the corresponding operations.

## Create Azure network connections

You create ANCs to define the connection between your network and the Windows 365 system so that Cloud PCs can be successfully provisioned. When you create an ANC, the Windows 365 [service principal](/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/service-accounts-introduction-azure#service-principals) requires the following permissions:

- **Reader permission on the Azure subscription**: This permission is used to simplify the flow when adding a custom image.
- **Windows365 Network Interface Contributor role on the specified resource group**: This permission is used to create network interface cards in the selected resource group.
- **Windows365 Network User role on the virtual network**: This permission is used to attach the created network interface cards to the selected virtual network. 

When you create an ANC, you must be signed in with an account that is an Owner of the subscription. 

> [!TIP]
> When you use [Microsoft hosted network option](architecture.md#virtual-network-connectivity) with a gallery image, you do not need to grant the Windows 365 service principal these permissions.

For more information, see [Create Azure network connection](create-azure-network-connection.md).

## Add a custom image

If youâ€™ve already created an ANC for the image's associated Azure subscription, no new permissions are needed.

When you use Windows 365 with a Microsoft hosted network and a custom image, the Windows 365 service principal requires the following permission to upload a custom image:

- Reader of the subscription

When you upload a custom image, you must be signed in with an account that is an Owner or admin of the subscription.

For more information, see [Add or delete custom device images](add-device-images.md).
