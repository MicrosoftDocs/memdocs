# Role-based access control

Role-based access control (RBAC) helps you manage who has access to your organization's resources and what they can do with those resources. You can assign roles for your Cloud PCs by using the [Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431).

For more information, see [Role-based access control (RBAC) with Microsoft Intune](/mem/intune/fundamentals/role-based-access-control).

## Windows 365 Admin role

Windows 365 now supports the Windows 365 Admin role available for role assignment through Microsoft Admin Center and Azure Active Directory. With this role, admins can manage Windows 365 Cloud PCs for both Enterprise and Business editions in the most comprehensive way possible while providing more scoped permissions than other more powerful AAD roles like Global Administrator. For more information, go to [Azure AD built-in roles](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/roles/permissions-reference).

## Cloud PC built-in roles

Two new built-in roles are available for Cloud PC:

**Cloud PC Administrator**: Manages all aspects of Cloud PCs, like:

- OS image management
- On-premises network connection configuration
- Provisioning

**Cloud PC Reader**: Views Cloud PC data available in the Cloud PC node in Microsoft Endpoint Manager, but canâ€™t make changes.

## Custom roles

Custom roles aren't supported for Cloud PCs.
