# Role-based access control

Role-based access control (RBAC) helps you manage who has access to your organization's resources and what they can do with those resources. You can assign roles for your Cloud PCs by using the [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431).

When a user with the Subscription Owner or User Access Administrator role creates, edits, or retries an ANC, Windows 365 transparently assigns the required built-in roles the following resources (if tehy're not already assigned):

- Azure Subscription
- Resource group
- Virtual network associated with the ANC

If you only have the Subscription Reader role, these assignments aren't automatic. Instead, you must manually configure the required built-in roles to the Windows First Party App in Azure.

For more information, see [Role-based access control (RBAC) with Microsoft Intune](/mem/intune/fundamentals/role-based-access-control).

## Windows 365 Administrator role

Windows 365 supports the Windows 365 Administrator role available for role assignment through the Microsoft Admin Center and Microsoft Entra ID. With this role, you can manage Windows 365 Cloud PCs for both Enterprise and Business editions. The Windows 365 Administrator role can grant more scoped permissions than other Microsoft Entra roles like Global Administrator. For more information, see [Microsoft Entra built-in roles](/azure/active-directory/roles/permissions-reference).

## Cloud PC built-in roles

The following built-in roles are available for Cloud PC:

### Cloud PC Administrator

Manages all aspects of Cloud PCs, like:

- OS image management
- Azure network connection configuration
- Provisioning

### Cloud PC Reader

Views Cloud PC data available in the Windows 365 node in Microsoft Intune, but canâ€™t make changes.

### Windows 365 Network Interface Contributor

The Windows 365 Network Interface Contributor role is assigned to the resource group associated with the Azure network connection (ANC). This role allows the Windows 365 service to create and join the NIC and manage deployment in the resource group. This role is a collection of the minimum permissions required to operate Windows 365 when using an ANC.

| Action type | Permissions |
| --- | --- |
| actions | Microsoft.Resources/subscriptions/resourcegroups/read</br>Microsoft.Resources/deployments/read</br>Microsoft.Resources/deployments/write</br>Microsoft.Resources/deployments/delete</br>Microsoft.Resources/deployments/operations/read</br>Microsoft.Resources/deployments/operationstatuses/read</br>Microsoft.Network/locations/operations/read</br>Microsoft.Network/locations/operationResults/read</br>Microsoft.Network/locations/usages/read</br>Microsoft.Network/networkInterfaces/write</br>Microsoft.Network/networkInterfaces/read</br>Microsoft.Network/networkInterfaces/delete</br>Microsoft.Network/networkInterfaces/join/action</br>Microsoft.Network/networkInterfaces/effectiveNetworkSecurityGroups/action</br>Microsoft.Network/networkInterfaces/effectiveRouteTable/action</br> |
| notActions | None |
| dataActions | None |
| notDataActions | None |

### Windows 365 Network User

The Windows 365 Network User role is assigned to the virtual network associated with the ANC. This role allows the Windows 365 service to join the NIC to the virtual network. This role is a collection of the minimum permissions required to operate Windows 365 when using an ANC.

| Action type | Permissions |
| --- | --- |
| actions | Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/read<br>Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/subnets/read<br>Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/usages/read<br>Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/subnets/join/action |
| notActions | None |
| dataActions | None |
| notDataActions | None |

## Custom roles

You can create custom roles for Windows 365 in [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431). For more information, see [Create a custom role]( /mem/intune/fundamentals/create-custom-role).

To create a provisioning policy, an admin needs the following permissions:

- Azure Network Connections/Read
- Supported Region/Read
- Device Images/Read

## Migrating existing permissions

For ANCs created before November 26, 2023, the Network Contributor role is used to apply permissions on both the Resource Group and Virtual Network. To apply to the new RBAC roles, you can retry the ANC health check. The existing roles must be manually removed.

To manually remove the existing roles and add the new roles, refer to the following table for the existing roles used on each Azure resource. Before removing the existing roles make sure that the updated roles are assigned.

| Azure resource | Existing role (before November 26, 2023) | Updated role (after November 26, 2023) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Resource group | Network Contributor | Windows 365 Network Interface Contributor |
| Virtual network | Network Contributor | Windows 365 Network User |
| Subscription | Reader | Reader |

For more details about removing a role assignment from an Azure resource, see [Remove Azure role assignments](/azure/role-based-access-control/role-assignments-remove).

## Scope tags

Windows 365 support for scope tags is in [public preview](../public-preview.md).

For RBAC, roles are only part of the equation. While roles work well to define a set of permissions, scope tags help define visibility of your organizationâ€™s resources. Scope tags are most helpful when organizing your tenant to have users scoped to certain hierarchies, geographical regions, business units, and so on.

Use Intune to create and manage scope tags. For more information on how scope tags are created and managed, see [Use role-based access control (RBAC) and scope tags for distributed IT](/mem/intune/fundamentals/scope-tags).  

In Windows 365, scope tags can be applied to the following resources:

- Provisioning policies
- Azure network connections (ANC)
- Cloud PCs
- Custom images
- Windows 365 RBAC role assignments

To make sure that both the Intune-owned **All devices** list and Windows 365-owned **All Cloud PCs** list show the same Cloud PCs based on scope, follow these steps after creating your scope tags and provisioning policy:

1. Create a Microsoft Entra ID dynamic device group with rule that enrollmentProfileName equals the exact name of the provisioning policy created.  
2. Assign the created scope tag  to the dynamic device group.
3. After the Cloud PC is provisioned and enrolled into Intune, both the All Devices list and All Cloud PCs list should display the same Cloud PCs.  

To let scoped administrators view which scope tags are assigned to them and the objects within their scope, they must be assigned one of the following roles:

- Intune read only
- Cloud PC reader/administrator
- A custom role with similar permissions.

### Graph API bulk actions and scope tags during the public preview

For the duration of the scope tags public preview, the following bulk actions don't honor scope tags when called directly from the Graph API:

- Restore
- Reprovision
- Place Cloud PC under review
- Remove Cloud PC under review
- Share Cloud PC restore point to storage
- Create Cloud PC manual restore point
