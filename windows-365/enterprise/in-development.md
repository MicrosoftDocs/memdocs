### Support for symmetric NAT with RDP Shortpath<!--43602619-->

TURN is a popular standard for device-to-device networking for low latency, high-throughput data transmission with Azure Communication Services. For more information about TURN and Azure Communication Services, see [Network Traversal Concepts](/azure/communication-services/concepts/network-traversal). For more information about RDP Shortpath, see [Use RDP Shortpath for public networks with Windows 365](rdp-shortpath-public-networks.md).
