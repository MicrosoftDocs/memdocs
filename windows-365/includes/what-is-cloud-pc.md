## What is a Cloud PC?

A Cloud PC is a highly available, optimized, and scalable virtual machine providing end users with a rich Windows desktop experience. It’s hosted in the Windows 365 service and is accessible from anywhere, on any device.

End users have a 1:1 relationship with their Cloud PC. It’s their own personal PC in the cloud. Users can connect to their Cloud PC by using [windows365.microsoft.com](https://windows365.microsoft.com/). [Browser and app-based access](/windows-365/end-user-access-cloud-pc) is available for Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android devices. Desk-based users can also use Microsoft's NXT to connect securely to your Windows 365 Cloud PC in seconds.

### Creating a Cloud PC

Cloud PCs are created automatically by the Windows 365 service when an end user in an appropriate Microsoft Entra user group is assigned a Windows 365 license.

Admins don't manually create Cloud PCs.
