# Resize a Windows 365 Business Cloud PC

[!INCLUDE [Resize a Cloud PC intro](../includes/resize-introduction.md)]

## Requirements

### Role requirements

To resize a Cloud PC, the admin must have certain built-in Microsoft Entra roles.

For a Cloud PC provisioned with a direct assigned license, at least one of the following roles:

- Windows 365 Administrator

Alternatively, you can assign a custom role that includes the permissions of this built-in role.

## Resize a Windows 365 Cloud PC

When resizing Windows 365 Cloud PCs, the Windows 365 service automatically takes care of: 

- Unassigning the original license.
- Assigning the new license on behalf of the admin.

1. Sign in to the windows365.microsoft.com, select **Your organization's Cloud PCs** > choose a device > **Devices** > **Resize**.

2. Under **Resize**, there's a list of the sizes that you can upgrade or downsize to based on the licenses available in your inventory. You can upgrade a Cloud PC’s **Processor** and **RAM**. **Storage** can only be upgraded. Select one of the available options.

3. Select **Resize**.

If there are available licenses, the resizing starts.

If there are no licenses available, then you can purchase a new license at the Windows 365 Market place. The newly purchased license will be available for upgrade soon.
