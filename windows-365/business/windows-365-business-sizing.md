# Windows 365 Business sizing options

Windows 365 Businessâ€¯offers fixed-price licensing (through Microsoft 365) for different Cloud PC sizes. When you assign a license to a user, you need to select one of several size options. Each has a different number of CPUs, RAM, and storage, and is intended to support different usage scenarios. Assess your business requirements to determine which sizes make sense for your users.

This table shows examples of the different sizes available for a Cloud PC.

> [!NOTE]
> If Microsoft 365 Apps and Microsoft Teams are included in the **Supported apps** column, they are pre-installed for those Cloud PC options.  Additional licensing is required for these apps.
