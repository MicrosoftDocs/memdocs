# Add a user and assign a license

You can add a user and assign them licenses by following these steps:

1. Sign in to [windows365.microsoft.com](https://windows365.microsoft.com) with a Microsoft Entra Global Administrator account.
2. Select **Your organization’s Cloud PCs** > **Add a user**.
3. Choose **Select products** to see all available licenses that can be assigned to the user.
4. Select the licenses that you want to assign to the user > **Update**.
5. Under **User information**, enter a first and last name, username, and select a domain name.
6. If you want to specify a password, de-select the **Automatically create a password** box. Then, enter a password.
7. If you don’t want to require the user to change their password when they first sign into the new Cloud PC, de-select the **This user must change their password when they first sign in** box.
8. If you don't want to automatically email the sign-in info to the user, de-select **Email the sign-in info** box.
9. Select **Add user**. A new Cloud PC will be created and the user can use the sign-in information to access it.
