# End-user hardware requirements to access a Cloud PC

To access their Cloud PC, an end-user's hardware must meet certain requirements. These requirements vary depending on which Microsoft Remote Desktop client the end-user installs.

## Windows App

For more information about the requirements of running and using Windows App, see [Get started with Windows App](/windows-app/get-started-connect-devices-desktops-apps).

## Windows 365 app

For information about the requirements for running the Windows 365 app, see the [Windows 365 end user documentation](https://support.microsoft.com/topic/cbb0d4d5-69d4-4f00-b050-6dc7a02d02d0 ).

## Microsoft Remote Desktop client for Windows

Downloads available for:

- [Windows 64-bit](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2068602)

- **Hard drive**: 100 MB or more
- **.NET Framework version**: 4.6.1 or later
- **Video**: DirectX 9 or later with WDDM 1.0 driver

If you'll be using Microsoft Teams on the Cloud PCs, the Windows device requirements increase to:

- **CPU**: At least 2vCPU with Minimum 1.6 GHz or faster processor. For higher video/screen share resolution and frame rate, a four-core processor or better is recommended.
- **RAM**: 4096 MB
- **Hard drive**: 3 GB or more
- **.NET Framework version**: 4.6.1 or later
- **Video**: DirectX 9 or later with WDDM 1.0 driver. Background video effects require Windows 10/11 or a processor with AVX2 instruction set. Also, Teams audio and video offloading on a Cloud PC benefits from a dedicated Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) within the device.

You can access Windows 365 Cloud PCs from your Linux OS devices by using:

- The web client available at windows365.microsoft.com.
- Third-party clients to connect to Azure Virtual Desktop, including:
  - [Dell](https://www.delltechnologies.com/asset/en-us/products/thin-clients/technical-support/dell-thinos-9-for-microsoft-wvd.pdf)
  - [HP](https://h20195.www2.hp.com/v2/GetDocument.aspx?docname=c07051097)
  - [IGEL](https://www.igel.com/igel-solution-family/)

  Third-party Linux client solutions can't be managed by using Microsoft Intune. The partner provides a separate management tool for Linux devices.
