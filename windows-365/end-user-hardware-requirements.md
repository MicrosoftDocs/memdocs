# End-user hardware requirements to access a Cloud PC

To access their Cloud PC, an end-user's hardware must meet certain requirements. These requirements vary depending on which Microsoft Remote Desktop client the end-user installs.

## Microsoft Remote Desktop client for Windows

Downloads available for:

- [Windows 64-bit](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2068602)
- [Windows 32-bit](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2098960)

Hardware requirements:

- **Operating systems**: Windows 10, Windows 8.1, Windows Server 2019, Windows Server 2016, Windows Server 2012 R2
- **CPU**: 1vCPU with 1 GHz or faster processor
- **RAM**: 1024 MB
- **Hard drive**: 100 MB or more
- **.NET Framework version**: 4.6.1 or later
- **Video**: DirectX 9 or later with WDDM 1.0 driver

If you'll be using Microsoft Teams on the Cloud PCs, the Windows device requirements increase to:

- **CPU**: At least 2vCPU with Minimum 1.6 GHz or faster processor. For higher video/screen share resolution and frame rate, a four-core processor or better is recommended.
- **RAM**: 1024 MB
- **Hard drive**: 3 GB or more
- **.NET Framework version**: 4.6.1 or later
- **Video**: DirectX 9 or later with WDDM 1.0 driver. Background video effects require Windows 10 or a processor with AVX2 instruction set. Also, Teams audio and video offloading on a Cloud PC benefits from a dedicated Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) within the device.

## Microsoft Remote Desktop client for Windows from the Microsoft Store

Download from the [Microsoft Store](https://www.microsoft.com/store/p/microsoft-remote-desktop/9wzdncrfj3ps).
