For information on hardware requirements, see [End user hardware requirements](end-user-hardware-requirements.md).

## Windows App

For more information about the requirements of running and using Windows App, see [What is Windows App?](/windows-app/overview).

## Windows 365 web site

Users can navigate to [windows365.microsoft.com](https://windows365.microsoft.com) to access their Cloud PCs.  

### Software requirements

To access their Cloud PC from this website, the user's device must meet the following requirements:

- Supported operating systems: Windows, macOS, ChromeOS, Linux
- A modern browser like Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome, Safari, Mozilla Firefox (v55.0 and later), or LG webOS 23.

### Home page

![Windows 365 home.](business/media/get-started-windows-365-business/cloud-pc-home.png)

From this page, users have two options to connect to your Cloud PC:

- Select **Open in browser** to open their Cloud PC in the web client (not available for mobile devices). For more information, see [Windows 365 web client](#windows-365-web-client).
- Select **Open in Remote Desktop app** to open their Cloud PC in Remote Desktop. For more information, see [Remote Desktop](#remote-desktop).

### User actions

While on windows365.microsoft.com, users can take actions on their Cloud PCs by selecting the gear icon on a Cloud PC card.

![Card menu.](business/media/get-started-windows-365-business/cloud-pc-gear.png)

     ![Screenshot of connection details.](media/end-user-access-cloud-pc/connection-details.png)

### Transfer files to and from a Cloud PC

To transfer files from the local device to the Cloud PC, select the upload icon to launch File Explorer. Select the files to transfer them to the \This PC\Windows365 virtual drive\Uploads folder on the Cloud PC.

To transfer files from the Cloud PC to the local device, copy the files to the Downloads folder on the Cloud PC. The files will be copied to the \This PC\Windows365 virtual drive\Downloads folder of the local device.

#### Restrict users from transferring files to and from Cloud PCs

You can restrict users from transferring files by using RDP drive redirection. For more information, see [Manage RDP device redirections for Cloud PCs](./enterprise/manage-rdp-device-redirections.md).

### Collect user logs

Users can collect logs of their Cloud PC sessions. The logs are collected from the browser and the user can choose the save location.

To turn on log collection, in the client, select the information icon > **Capture logs**.

   ![Capture logs.](media/get-users-started/settings-logs.png)

### Hardware acceleration

You can turn on hardware acceleration when using the web client to access your Cloud PC. This option decreases network latency, improving the web client Cloud PC experience. This option is turned on by default.

To turn hardware acceleration on or off, in the client, select the gear icon > **Use hardware acceleration**.

### High DPI

You can use the **High DPI** toggle to render the web client using the native resolution of the physical device. This is a good option to turn on if you're using a high resolution screen, like 4K or UHD monitors.

The High Dots Per Inch (DPI) setting adjusts the display resolution to match the physical size of the screen and the distance between the user and the screen.

To choose this option, select the gear icon > **High DPI**.

### Alternative keyboard layout

Use this option if you're using a nonstandard keyboard that includes special characters (like Chinese (Traditional) or Spanish (Mexico)).

1. In the Windows 365 web client **In Session Settings** window, choose **Show advanced settings** > **Alternative keyboard layout** > **On**.

   ![Screencap of In Sessions Settings window Alternative Keyboard Layout.](media/end-user-access-cloud-pc/alternative-keyboard-layout.png)
2. In the drop-down list, select the language that matches the keyboard.

By default, **Alternative keyboard layout** is turned off. If using a standard keyboard that doesn't require special layouts, the user can deselect this option. Deselecting the option in the middle of a session requires reconnecting.

### Location (preview)

Location redirection lets Cloud PCs access your approximate location safely without privacy concerns. By turning on the location service, you let your Cloud PC use the location of your physical device for most apps (the Weather widget isn't currently supported).

For more information about location services, see [Windows location service and privacy](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-location-service-and-privacy-3a8eee0a-5b0b-dc07-eede-2a5ca1c49088).

Location redirection requires local admin privileges on the Cloud PC. For more information, see [Assign user as a local admin](enterprise/assign-users-as-local-admin.md).

To turn on location redirection, follow these steps:

1. On your physical device, go to **Settings** > **Privacy & Security** > **Location**.
2. For **Location services**, set the toggle to **On**.
3. For **Let apps access your location**, set the toggle to **On**.
4. For each app that you want your Cloud PC to have location information, set the toggle to **On**.
5. Go to windows365.microsoft.com.
6. Under **Your Cloud PCs**, select **Open in a browser** for your Cloud PC.
7. Under **In Session Settings**, select **Location (Preview)** > **Connect**.

     ![Screenshot of Location redirection option.](media/end-user-access-cloud-pc/location.png)
8. In the **windows365.microsoft.com wants to Know your location** confirmation box, select **Allow**.

Organizational settings might override the location settings for your device. For example, your organization might disable location redirection for all Cloud PCs they manage.

### Keyboard shortcuts (preview)

While accessing your Cloud PC using the web client, you can set your Cloud PCs to use special keyboard shortcuts (combination keys with the Windows key, ESC, and so on). For a full list of shortcuts, see [Keyboard shortcuts in Windows](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/keyboard-shortcuts-in-windows-dcc61a57-8ff0-cffe-9796-cb9706c75eec).

Keyboard shortcuts are  in [public preview](public-preview.md).

To turn on keyboard shortcuts for your Cloud PC:

1. Go to windows365.microsoft.com.
2. Under **Your Cloud PCs**, select **Open in a browser** for your Cloud PC.
3. Under **In Session Settings**, select **Keyboard shortcuts (Preview)** > **Connect**.
   :::image type="content" source="media/end-user-access-cloud-pc/keyboard-shortcuts.png" alt-text="Screencap of In Sessions Settings Keyboard shortcuts." lightbox="media/end-user-access-cloud-pc/keyboard-shortcuts.png":::

When **Keyboard shortcuts** is turned on, the web client opens in full-screen mode. Keyboard shortcuts only work in full-screen mode. Full screen using F11 isn't supported. You must use the full screen mode from the toolbar.

To turn off keyboard shortcuts, in your web client, select **Settings** > deselect **Keyboard shortcuts** > **Update**.

### LG webOS 23

The Windows 365 web client can be accessed through LG TV with the latest webOS 23.

- Keyboard shortcuts

## Remote Desktop

The Microsoft Remote Desktop app lets users access and control a remote PC, including a Cloud PC.

For a list of clients by operating system, see [Remote Desktop clients](/windows-server/remote/remote-desktop-services/clients/remote-desktop-clients). For a comparison of features by client, see [Compare the clients: features](/azure/virtual-desktop/compare-remote-desktop-clients).

### Install the Microsoft Remote Desktop app

To set up their Remote Desktop client, users follow these steps:

1. Download the Remote Desktop app from the [Remote Desktop clients page](/windows-server/remote/remote-desktop-services/clients/remote-desktop-clients).
