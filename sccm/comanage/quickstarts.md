# Cloud-attach with co-management

![Blastoff series banner](media/blastoff-banner.png)

Co-management adds new functionality to your existing Configuration Manager deployment, without changing how you already work. When you enable co-management, you immediately begin benefitting from the cloud. You can apply that value to your existing management infrastructure and processes.

In this co-management quickstart series, see how you can quickly drive new management value. Co-management is built to create features and tools you can use right now.


In the following video, Microsoft corporate vice president Brad Anderson introduces this co-management series:

## Immediate value

| | | |
|-|-|-|
| <a name="bkmk_ca"></a>**Conditional access with device compliance** | Control user access to corporate resources based on compliance rules from Intune | [![Thumbnail of conditional access video](media/thumbnail-conditional-access.png)](/sccm/comanage/quickstart-conditional-access) |
| <a name="bkmk_remote"></a>**Remote actions from Intune** | Run remote actions from Intune for co-managed devices. For example, wipe and reset a device and maintain enrollment and account | [![Thumbnail of remote actions video](media/thumbnail-remote-action.png)](/sccm/comanage/quickstart-remote-actions) |
| <a name="bkmk_client-health"></a>**Configuration Manager client health** | Maintain visibility of Configuration Manager client health from the Intune on Azure portal | [![Thumbnail of client health video](media/thumbnail-client-health.png)](/sccm/comanage/quickstart-client-health) |
| <a name="bkmk_hybrid-aad"></a>**Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)** | With Azure AD you can take advantage of improved productivity for your users and security for your resources, across both cloud and on-prem environments | [![Thumbnail of hybrid Azure AD video](media/thumbnail-azure-ad.png)](/sccm/comanage/quickstart-hybrid-aad) |
| <a name="bkmk_autopilot"></a>**Windows Autopilot** | Reduce time, resources, and complexity associated with deploying, managing, and retiring or recycling devices. Autopilot also creates a better experience for end users. | [![Thumbnail of Windows Autopilot video](media/thumbnail-autopilot.png)](/sccm/comanage/quickstart-autopilot) |



## Getting started

If you want to enable co-management, start here to unblock the technical concerns you may have.

| | | |
|-|-|-|
| <a name="bkmk_paths"></a>**Paths to co-management** | There are two primary ways for you to set up co-management, and it’s important to understand the prerequisites for each path.  Each path requires some combination of Azure AD, ConfigMgr, Intune, and Windows client. | [![Thumbnail of co-management paths slide](media/thumbnail-paths.png)](/sccm/comanage/quickstart-paths) |
| <a name="bkmk_setup-hybrid-aad"></a>**Set up hybrid Azure AD** | If your environment currently has domain-joined Windows 10 devices, set up hybrid Azure AD before you can enable co-management | [![Thumbnail of hybrid Azure AD set up video](media/thumbnail-setup-azure-ad.png)](/sccm/comanage/quickstart-setup-hybrid-aad) |
| <a name="bkmk_upgrade-win10"></a>**Upgrade to Windows 10** | Windows 10 version 1709 or later is required for co-management | [![Thumbnail of upgrade Windows 10 video](media/thumbnail-upgrade-win10.png)](/sccm/comanage/quickstart-upgrade-win10) |
| <a name="bkmk_migrate-hybrid-mdm"></a>**Migrate from hybrid MDM** | Hybrid MDM (Intune integrated with Configuration Manager) is deprecated. Intune standalone is required for co-management. | [![Thumbnail of migrate hybrid MDM video](media/thumbnail-migrate-hybrid-mdm.png)](/sccm/comanage/quickstart-migrate-hybrid-mdm) |
| <a name="bkmk_fasttrack"></a>**Get help from FastTrack** | The FastTrack organization is a large group of Microsoft engineers who specialize in helping all types of organizations deploy Microsoft 365 apps, including setting up co-management. | [![Thumbnail of FastTrack video](media/thumbnail-fasttrack.png)](/sccm/comanage/quickstart-fasttrack) |
