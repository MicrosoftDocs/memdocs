# How to enable co-management in Configuration Manager

When you enable co-management, you can gain immediate value. Then once you're ready, you can start transitioning workloads as needed in your environment.

Make sure the co-management prerequisites are set up before you start this process. For more information, see [Prerequisites](/sccm/comanage/overview#prerequisites).

## Enable co-management starting in version 1906

To enable co-management starting in Configuration Manager version 1906, follow the instructions below:

[!INCLUDE [Enable Co-management in version 1906 and later](includes/enable-co-management-1906-and-higher.md)]

## Enable co-management in version 1902 and earlier

To enable co-management for Configuration Manager version 1902 and earlier, follow the instructions below:

[!INCLUDE [Enable Co-management in version 1902 and earlier](includes/enable-co-management-1902-and-earlier.md)]

## Next steps

Now that you've enabled co-management, look at the following articles for immediate value you can gain in your environment:
