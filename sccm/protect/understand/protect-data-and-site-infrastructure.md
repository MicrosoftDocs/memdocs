# Protect data and site infrastructure with System Center Configuration Manager
You want your users to be able to securely access your organization's resources, so that both your infrastructure and your data are protected from exposure or malicious attack. The information in these topics describes how to enable that access and how to help protect your organization's resources.  
  
-   You can minimize your users' efforts to connect to corporate resources by enabling VPN connectivity using VPN profiles. Learn more in [VPN profiles in System Center Configuration Manager](../../protect/deploy-use/vpn-profiles.md).  
  
-   Wi-Fi profiles in provide a set of tools and resources to help you create, deploy, and monitor wireless network settings to devices in your organization. By deploying these settings, you minimize the effort that end users require to connect to corporate wireless networks. Learn more in [Wi-Fi Profiles in System Center Configuration Manager](../Topic/Wi-Fi%20Profiles%20in%20System%20Center%20Configuration%20Manager.md).  
  
-   [Certificate profiles in System Center Configuration Manager](../Topic/Certificate%20profiles%20in%20System%20Center%20Configuration%20Manager.md) describes how to provision your users' devices with the certificates they need to connect to company resources.  
  
-   [System Center Endpoint Protection](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/mt634331.aspx) lets you  manage antimalware policies and Windows Firewall security for client computers.  
  
-   You can use conditional access to help secure email and other services on devices that are enrolled with Microsoft Intune, as described in [Manage access to services in System Center Configuration Manager](../../protect/deploy-use/manage-access-to-services.md).  
  
-   Email profiles provide a set of tools and resources to help you create, deploy and monitor email settings on devices. This enables users to access corporate email on their personal devices without any required setup on their part. Learn more in [Email profiles in System Center Configuration Manager](../Topic/Email%20profiles%20in%20System%20Center%20Configuration%20Manager.md).  
  
-   Configuration Manager lets you integrate with Windows Hello for Business (formerly Microsoft Passport for Work) which is an alternative sign-in method that uses Active Directory, or an Azure Active Directory account to replace a password, smart card, or virtual smart card. Learn more in [Windows Hello for Business settings in System Center Configuration Manager](../../protect/deploy-use/windows-hello-for-business-settings.md).
