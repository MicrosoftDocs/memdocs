# Creating the UI Extension
This section provides task-based topics that show you how to create the UI extension for application management in Configuration Manager.  

> [!TIP]
>  A complete sample project implementing a custom deployment type for Remote Desktop Protocol (*.rdp) files is provided separately for reference. The discussion throughout the Extending Application Management section leverages the Remote Desktop Protocol sample project for examples and illustration.
