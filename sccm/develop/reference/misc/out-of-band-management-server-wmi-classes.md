# Configuration Manager Out of Band Management Server WMI Classes
Out of Band Management server Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) classes in System Center Configuration Manager assist in managing the complex task of provisioning unknown systems in the enterprise.The System Center Configuration Manager server class schema is a set of WMI classes that represent the objects on a server running Configuration Manager. Each Configuration Manager class is a template for a managed object, and all instances of the object use the template. Classes can contain properties and methods. The properties describe the class data, and the methods typically perform data management. For more information about developing applications by using these classes, see [About Configuration Manager SDK Requirements](../../../develop/core/reqs/about-configuration-manager-sdk-requirements.md).
