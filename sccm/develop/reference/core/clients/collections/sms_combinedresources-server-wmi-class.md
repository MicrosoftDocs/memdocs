# SMS_CombinedResources Server WMI Class
The `SMS_CombinedResources` Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) class is an SMS Provider server class, in System Center Configuration Manager, represents all the device and user resources in the system.  

 The following syntax is simplified from Managed Object Format (MOF) code and includes all inherited properties.  

## Syntax  

```  
Class SMS_ CombinedResources: SMS_BaseClass  
{  
      String Domain;  
      String Name;  
      UInt32 ResourceID;  
      UInt32 ResourceType;  
      String SMSID;  
};  
```  

## Methods  
 The `SMS_ CombinedResources` class does not define any methods.  

## Properties  
 `Domain`  
 Data type: `String`  

 Access type: Read/Write  

 Qualifiers: None  

 Domain to which the resource belongs.  

 `Name`  
 Data type: `String`  

 Access type: Read/Write  

 Qualifiers: None  

 Name of the resource.  

 `ResourceID`  
 Data type: `UInt32`  

 Access type: Read/Write  

 Qualifiers: [key]  

 Unique System Center Configuration Manager supplied ID for the resource. This ID is not unique across sites.  

 `ResourceType`  
 Data type: `UInt32`  

 Access type: Read/Write  

 Qualifiers: None  

 Type of resource, for example, system or user. For more information, see SMS_ResourceMap Server WMI Class.  

 `SMSID`  
 Data type: `String`  

 Access type: Read Only  

 Qualifiers: None  

 GUID generated by the client. This property is only set if the `IsClient` property is set to `true`.  

## Remarks  
 Similar to the members class that is generated for querying "All Systems," this class is designed for summarizing the major properties across different feature areas and is not bound by the same RBAC rules as the "All Systems" resource class.  

 Class qualifiers for this class include:  

-   Abstract  

 For more information about both the class qualifiers and the property qualifiers included in the Properties section, see [Configuration Manager Class and Property Qualifiers](../../../../../develop/reference/misc/class-and-property-qualifiers.md).
