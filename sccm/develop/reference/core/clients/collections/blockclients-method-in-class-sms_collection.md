# BlockClients Method in Class SMS_Collection
The `BlockClients` Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) class method, in System Center Configuration Manager, blocks specified client computers from communicating with the site.  

 The following syntax is simplified from Managed Object Format (MOF) code and defines the method.  

## Syntax  

```  
SInt32 BlockClients(  
     UInt32 ResourceIDs[],  
     Boolean Blocked  
);  
```  

#### Parameters  
 `ResourceIDs`  
 Data type: `UInt32` Array  

 Qualifiers: [in]  

 IDs of member resources.  

 `Blocked`  
 Data type: `Boolean`  

 Qualifiers: [in, optional]  

 `true` if resources are blocked from communicating with the site. The default value is true.  

## Return Values  
 An  `SInt32` data type that is 0 to indicate success or non-zero to indicate failure.
