# Application Management Client Interfaces
In System Center Configuration Manager, the application management interfaces are used by client applications to manage application management functionality on the client.  

## In This Section  

|Term|Definition|  
|----------|----------------|  
|[AppDetectState Enumeration](../../../../../develop/reference/core/clients/client-classes/appdetectstate-enumeration.md)|The `AppDetectState` enumeration defines application installation states.  This enumeration is used by the [IAppManagementHandler Interface](../../../../../develop/reference/core/clients/client-classes/iappmanagementhandler-interface.md).|  
|[AppContentInfo Structure](../../../../../develop/reference/core/clients/client-classes/appcontentinfo-structure.md)|The `AppContentInfo` structure contains information about the application content.|  
|[AppDeploymentTypeData Structure](../../../../../develop/reference/core/clients/client-classes/appdeploymenttypedata-structure.md)|The `AppDeploymentTypeData` structure contains detection results for a set of deployment types.|  
|[AppDeploymentTypeItem Structure](../../../../../develop/reference/core/clients/client-classes/appdeploymenttypeitem-structure.md)|The `AppDeploymentTypeItem` structure contains detection results for an individual deployment type.|  
|[IAppContentExt Interface](../../../../../develop/reference/core/clients/client-classes/iappcontentext-interface.md)|The `IAppContentExt` interface defines functions to retrieve the application content information.|  
|[IAppManagementHandler Interface](../../../../../develop/reference/core/clients/client-classes/iappmanagementhandler-interface.md)|The `IAppManagementHandler` interface defines functions to interact with the handler.|  
|[IAppManagementTypes Interface](../../../../../develop/reference/core/clients/client-classes/iappmanagementtypes-interface.md)|The `IAppManagementTypes` interface is a container for Application Management related type definitions.|
