# SMS_AntimalwareSpynetConfig Server WMI Class
The `SMS_AntimalwareSpynetConfig` Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) class is an SMS Provider server class, in Configuration Manager, that represents the configuration of SpyNet on a client computer.  

 The following syntax is simplified from Managed Object Format (MOF) code and includes all inherited properties.  

## Syntax  

```  
Class SMS_AntimalwareSpynetConfig : SMS_ClientAgentConfig_BaseClass  
{  
    UInt32 AgentID;  
    Boolean AllowUserChangeSpyNetSettings;  
    UInt32 CloudBlockLevel;
    UInt32 JoinSpyNet;  
};  
```  

## Methods  
 The `SMS_AntimalwareSpynetConfig` class does not define any methods.  

## Properties  
 `AgentID`  
 Data type: `UInt32`  

 Access type: Read-only  

 Qualifiers: [key, read]  

 A unique identifier for the agent.  

 `AllowUserChangeSpyNetSettings`  
 Data type: `Boolean`  

 Access type: Read/Write  

 Qualifiers: None  

 This policy setting configures a local override for the configuration to join Microsoft SpyNet. This setting can only be set by Group Policy.  

 If you enable this setting, the local preference setting will take priority over Group Policy.  

 If you disable or do not configure this setting, Group Policy will take priority over the local preference setting.

 `CloudBlockLevel`  
 Data type: `UInt32`  

 Access type: Read/Write

 Qualifiers: None  

  Level for blocking suspicious files. Possible values are:

  |Value|Description|
  |---|---|
  |(0x0)|Normal|
  |(0x2)|High|

 `JoinSpyNet`  
 Data type: `UInt32`  

 Access type: Read/Write  

 Qualifiers: None  

 This policy setting allows you to join Microsoft SpyNet. Microsoft SpyNet is the online community that helps you choose how to respond to potential threats. The community also helps stop the spread of new malicious software infections.  

You can choose to send basic or additional information about detected software. Additional information helps Microsoft create new definitions and help it to protect your computer. This information can include things like location of detected items on your computer if harmful software was removed. The information will be automatically collected and sent. In some instances, personal information might unintentionally be sent to Microsoft. However, Microsoft will not use this information to identify you or contact you.

Possible values are:

|Value|Description|
|---|---|
|(0x0)|Disabled (default)|
|(0x1)|Basic membership|
|(0x2)|Advanced membership|

Basic membership will send basic information to Microsoft about software that has been detected, including where the software came from, the actions that you apply or that are applied automatically, and whether the actions were successful.  

Advanced membership, in addition to basic information, will send more information to Microsoft about malicious software, spyware, and potentially unwanted software, including the location of the software, file names, how the software operates, and how it has impacted your computer.  

If you enable this setting, you will join Microsoft SpyNet with the membership specified.  

If you disable or do not configure this setting, you will not join Microsoft SpyNet.
