# Removed and deprecated items for System Center Configuration Manager

*Applies to: System Center Configuration Manager (Current Branch)*

This article describes how to use the information about features, products, and operating systems that are removed from support for System Center Configuration Manager, or will be removed in a future update (deprecated). This article provides early notice about future changes that might affect your use of Configuration Manager.  

This information is subject to change with future releases, and might not include each deprecated feature, product, or operating system.  

## How to use this information  
When a feature, product, or operating system is first listed as deprecated, support for using it with Configuration Manager is scheduled to be removed in a future version of Configuration Manager. This information is provided to help you plan for alternatives to using that feature, product, or operating system. When the first version of Configuration Manager releases in which that support is removed, this article is updated to indicate that specific version.  

When support is removed for a feature or operating system, the feature or operating system remains supported when you use a previous version of Configuration Manager, as long as that version of Configuration Manager remains in support. However, when you use a version of Configuration Manager released after the date or version indicated, that version of Configuration Manager does not provide support.

For example, if a feature was scheduled to have its support removed with the first update released after September 2016, support for that feature would no longer be included in update 1610, which released in October of 2016.
-  With Update 1610, the feature would no longer be supported.
-  The article would be updated to indicate support was removed with version 1610.
However, if you continue to use an earlier version that supports the feature, like version 1602 or 1606, you can continue to use that feature until the version you use drops out of support.
