## **Customer Experience Improvement Program**  

### What This Feature Does:  
 The Customer Experience Improvement Program ("CEIP") collects basic information from the administration console about your hardware configuration and how you use our software and services in order to identify trends and usage patterns. CEIP also collects the type and number of errors you encounter, software and hardware performance, and the speed of services. We will not collect your name, address, or other contact information. No CEIP data is collected from client computers.  

### Information Collected, Processed, or Transmitted:  
 For more information about the information collected, processed, or transmitted by CEIP, see the [CEIP privacy statement](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=52097).  

### Use of Information:  
 We use this information to improve the quality, reliability, and performance of Microsoft software and services.  

### Choice/Control:  
 You are offered the opportunity to participate in CEIP during setup. If you choose to participate and later change your mind, you can turn off CEIP at any time by:  

1.  Open the Configuration Manager console.  

2.  Click the Application menu, click **Customer Experience Improvement Program**, click **I don't want to join the program at this time** and then click **OK**.  

> [!NOTE]  
>  Unless specifically set, all administrative console users inherit the CEIP choice made during initial installation. Changes to the CEIP setting from the Configuration Manager console are specific to the user and computer where they are made.  

## **Setup Updates**  

### What This Feature Does:  
 At the conclusion of the site server setup, a Windows Update agent scan is automatically initiated. If you have opted in to Windows Update and/or Microsoft Update the agent will scan for any applicable updates for your site server and install them or notify you based on your pre-existing Update Services preferences.  

### Information Collected, Processed, or Transmitted:  
 For details about what information is collected and how it is used, see the [Update Services Privacy Statement](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=212775).  

### Use of Information:  
 For details about what information is collected and how it is used, see the [Update Services Privacy Statement](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=212775).  

### Choice/Control:  
 For details about what information is collected and how it is used, see the [Update Services Privacy Statement](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=212775).  

## **Microsoft Update**  

### What This Feature Does:  
 Microsoft Update is a service that provides Windows updates as well as updates for other Microsoft software.  

### Information Collected, Processed, or Transmitted:  
 For details about what information is collected and how it is used, see the [Update Services Privacy Statement](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=212775).  

### Use of Information:  
 For details about what information is collected and how it is used, see the [Update Services Privacy Statement](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=212775).  

### Choice/Control:  
 The Software Updates feature is not configured by default. When administrators install and configure a software update point on a Windows Update Services (WSUS) server, this action automatically configures WSUS on that server and other WSUS servers in the Configuration Manager hierarchy. Administrators can disable the synchronization of software updates with Microsoft Update.  

##### To disable the synchronization of software updates with Microsoft Update  

1.  In the Configuration Manager console, click **Administration**.  

2.  In the **Administration** workspace, expand **Site Configuration**, and then click **Sites**.  

3.  In the results pane, click the central administration site or stand-alone primary site.  

4.  On the **Home** tab, in the **Settings** group, expand **Configure Site Components**, and then click **Software Update Point**.  

5.  In the **Software Update Point Component Properties** dialog box, on the **Sync Settings** tab, click **Do not synchronize from Microsoft Update or the upstream software update point**, and then click **OK**.  

 When you have a software update point that is configured to accept connections from the Internet, Configuration Manager Internet-based clients on the Internet always scan against this software update point, to determine which software updates are required. When these clients are on the Internet, they first try to download the software updates from Microsoft Update, rather than from an Internet-based distribution point. Only if this fails, will they try to download the required software updates from an Internet-based distribution point.  

 The administrator can configure software deployments so that clients on the intranet can download update content from Microsoft Update if they cannot download the content from a distribution point.  

## **Silverlight**  

### What This Feature Does:  
 Silverlight is a prerequisite for the Configuration Manager client and the Application Catalog. Silverlight updates automatically and has additional data processing and transmitting practices. Configuration Manager does not control this functionality.  

 The [Microsoft Silverlight 5.0 Privacy Statement](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=251808) should be read in conjunction with this privacy statement.  

### Information Collected, Processed, or Transmitted:  
 For details about what information is collected and how it is used, see the Silverlight Privacy Statement:  

-   [Microsoft Silverlight 5.0 Privacy Statement](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=251808).  

### Use of Information:  
 For details about what information is collected and how it is used, see the Silverlight Privacy Statement:  

-   [Microsoft Silverlight 5.0 Privacy Statement](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=251808).  

### Choice/Control:  
 For details about choice and control for Silverlight, see the Silverlight Privacy Statement:  

-   [Microsoft Silverlight 5.0 Privacy Statement](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=251808).  

## **Asset Intelligence**  

### What This Feature Does:  
 Asset Intelligence lets IT administrators define, track, and proactively manage conformity with configuration standards. Metering and reporting on the deployment and use of both physical and virtual applications helps organizations make better business decisions about software licensing and maintain compliance with licensing agreements.  

 After collecting usage data from Configuration Manager clients, administrators can use different features to view the data, including collections, queries, and reporting. This data, combined with data from software inventory, can assist in determining:  

-   How many copies of a particular software program have been deployed across the organization, and among those computers, how many users actually run the program.  

-   How many licenses of a particular software program are needed for purchase when renewing license agreements with a software vendor.  

-   Whether any users are still running a particular software program. If the program is not being used, an organization might consider retiring the program.  

-   Which times of the day a software program is most frequently used.  

### Information Collected, Processed, or Transmitted:  
 During each synchronization, a catalog of known software will be downloaded from Microsoft. The IT administrator can choose to send Microsoft information about uncategorized software titles discovered within their organization to be researched and added to the catalog. Prior to uploading this information, a dialog box shows exactly what data is going to be uploaded. Uploaded data cannot be recalled. Asset Intelligence does not send information about users and computers or license usage to Microsoft.  

### Use of Information:  
 After a software title is uploaded, Microsoft researchers identify, categorize, and then make that knowledge available to all other customers that use this feature and other consumers of the catalog. Any software title uploaded becomes public, in the sense that the knowledge of that given application and its categorization become part of the catalog, and then can be downloaded to other consumers of the catalog. Before you configure Asset Intelligence data collection and decide whether to submit information to Microsoft, consider the privacy requirements of your organization.  

### Choice/Control:  
 Asset Intelligence is not enabled in Configuration Manager by default. If the Configuration Manager administrator wants to send and receive data related to the Asset Intelligence feature then the administrator must create an Asset Intelligence synchronization point role. Without this role, no data related to this feature will be sent to or received from Microsoft. Even after creating the role, the administrator can enable or disable synchronization as well as set schedules to allow synchronization of data from the online catalog into the Configuration Manager database. Synchronization can be configured in the Asset Intelligence synchronization point role properties. Uploading of uncategorized titles never occurs automatically, and the system is not designed for this task to be automated. You must manually select and approve the upload of each software title.  

## **Endpoint Protection**  

### What This Feature Does:  
 Endpoint Protection provides one familiar experience for desktop management and protection that helps protect and remediate endpoints from viruses and malware.  

### Information Collected, Processed, or Transmitted:  
 For details about what information is collected and how it is used, see the [Microsoft System Center 2012 Endpoint Protection Privacy Statement](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh508835.aspx).  

### Use of Information:  
 For details about what information is collected and how it is used, see the [Microsoft System Center 2012 Endpoint Protection Privacy Statement](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh508835.aspx).  

### Choice/Control:  
 Endpoint Protection is not enabled in Configuration Manager by default. If the Configuration Manager administrator wants to enable the Endpoint Protection feature then the administrator must create an Endpoint Protection point role and deploy the Endpoint Protection agent to computers.  

##### To remove the Endpoint Protection point  

1.  In the Configuration Manager console, click **Administration**.  

2.  In the **Administration** workspace, click **Servers and Site System Roles**.  

3.  In the results pane, click the server that hosts the **Endpoint Protection point**.  

4.  In the **Site System Roles** details pane, select **Endpoint Protection point** and then, on the **Site Role** tab, in the **Site Role** settings group, click **Remove Role**, and click **Yes** to confirm.  

##### To remove the Endpoint Protection client  

1.  Set the **Manage Endpoint Protection client on client computers** client setting to **No**.  

2.  Deploy a package and program to uninstall the Endpoint Protection client.  

## **Automatic Download of Prerequisites and Language Packs**  

### What This Feature Does:  
 The Configuration Manager Setup, or separately through the Configuration Manager Setup Downloader utility, can contact Microsoft websites to download required prerequisite redistributables, language packs, and the latest updates to setup.  

 These files are copied to the site server during installation. Required files for remote role, secondary site, and client installations will be copied to the respective systems as part of those setups. They will be automatically installed only if an identical or a newer version of the component is not already installed on the target system. These files are persisted on the target system to support future repair operations.  

### Information Collected, Processed, or Transmitted:  
 Only standard computer information as described above is used during this process.  

### Use of Information:  
 The data is used to complete the necessary downloads.  

### Choice/Control:  
 Setup cannot complete without these downloads but they can be downloaded separately and a path to them provided to Setup.  

## **Site Hierarchy - Geographical View with Bing Maps**  

### What This Feature Does:  
 Site Hierarchy - geographical view allows you to view your Configuration Manager physical server topology using maps provided by Microsoft Bing Maps.  

### Information Collected, Processed, or Transmitted:  
 To enable this feature, location information you provide is sent from your server to the Bing Maps Web service.  

### Use of Information:  
 Microsoft uses the information to operate and improve Microsoft Bing Maps and other Microsoft sites and services. For more information, see the [Microsoft Online Privacy Statement](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=224911).  

### Choice/Control:  
 You can choose not to use the Geographical View for the Site Hierarchy. The Hierarchy Diagram view allows you to see the hierarchy and does not use the Bing Maps service.  

## **Cloud-Based Distribution Point**  

### What This Feature Does:  
 The cloud-based distribution point provisions a Configuration Manager distribution point designed to run in Windows Azure. Content assigned to a cloud-based distribution point is managed just like any other Configuration Manager distribution point.  

### Information Collected, Processed, or Transmitted:  
 The Windows Azure subscription ID, management certificate, and service certificate are stored in the Configuration Manager database when an administrator configures the feature. During configuration, a list of available geographic regions for hosting the cloud-based distribution point will be automatically retrieved from Windows Azure. All communications with cloud-based distribution points use HTTPS. Configuration Manager automatically encrypts and uploads packages assigned to a cloud-based distribution point. No information about the content assigned to the distribution point is collected by Microsoft.  

 The Windows Azure subscription ID and management certificate are sent to Windows Azure to authenticate each communication from the site server.  

 Client communications with a cloud-based distribution point use a Configuration Manager access token and do not contain Windows Azure subscription information. Clients use the service certificate to authenticate the cloud-based distribution point.  

 For details about what information is collected and how it is used by Windows Azure, see the [Windows Azure Trust Center](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=270141) and the [Windows Azure Privacy Statement](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=263680).  

### Use of Information:  
 The Windows Azure subscription ID and management certificate are sent to Windows Azure to authenticate each communication from the site server. Client communications with a cloud-based distribution point use a separate authentication method internal to Configuration Manager and do not contain Windows Azure subscription information.  

 For details about what information is collected and how it is used by Windows Azure, see the [Windows Azure Trust Center](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=270141) and the [Windows Azure Privacy Statement](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=263680).  

### Location and Security of Distribution Point Content  
 As part of the configuration step for each cloud-based distribution point, you must specify the geographic region of the Microsoft data centers in which the distribution point content will be stored. The location you chose will apply only to the cloud-based distribution point that is being configured. It will not change your geographic location selection for other Windows Azure services that you have in your account. You can configure multiple cloud-based distribution points in different geographies. Content uploaded to cloud-based distribution points is encrypted with a key unique to your organization's installation of Configuration Manager. Some content may be particularly sensitive to your organization or be subject to specific regulatory requirements.  

 For details about the location and security of data stored in Windows Azure, see the [Windows Azure Trust Center](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=270141) and the [Windows Azure Privacy Statement](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=263680).  

### Choice/Control:  
 This role is not installed by default. Configuration Manager administrators have control over what content is transferred to each cloud-based distribution point by using package assignment. Additionally, there is a client setting that must be enabled by the administrator for clients to use cloud-based distribution points. The service can be stopped from the Configuration Manager console and the role can be removed at any time.  

 To uninstall a cloud-based distribution point, administrators can select the distribution point in the Configuration Manager console, and select **Delete**.  

 When administrators delete a cloud-based distribution point from a hierarchy, Configuration Manager will attempt to remove the content from the cloud service in Windows Azure.  

## **Links to the Windows Store**  

### What This Feature Does:  
 The Configuration Manager administrator can create a link to a specific application available from the Windows Store. When end users click the link to install an application, the online store is automatically launched directly to the specified application. To access the Windows Store, users must sign in with a Microsoft account. Links to applications in the Windows Store are not supported on operating systems that are earlier than Windows 8.  

### Information Collected, Processed, or Transmitted:  
 A request with the application ID is sent to the Windows Store. For details about what information is sent and collected and how it is used by the Windows Store, see the Windows Store topic in the [Features Supplement of the Windows 8 Privacy Statement](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=263752).  

### Use of Information:  
 For details about what information is sent and collected and how it is used by the Windows Store, see the Windows Store topic in the [Windows 8 Features Privacy Statement features supplement](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=263752).

4.  In the **Email Notification Component Properties** dialog box, clear the **Enable email notification for alerts** check box, and click **OK**.  

## **Microsoft Intune Subscription**  

### What This Feature Does:  
 Customers who have purchased a subscription to Microsoft Intune can use Configuration Manager to manage their mobile devices that connected through Microsoft Intune.The [Microsoft Intune Privacy Statement](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=262214) should be read in conjunction with this privacy statement.  

### Information Collected, Processed, or Transmitted:  
 All communications with Microsoft Intune use HTTPS. To configure the Microsoft Intune subscription and to download the Certificate Signing Request (CSR) needed for configuration of iOS support, an administrator must sign in to Microsoft Intune by using their work or school account and password. These credentials are not stored within Configuration Manager. All other communications with Microsoft Intune are authenticated by using PKI certificates that are automatically generated by Microsoft Intune.  

 In order to manage devices that are connected to Microsoft Intune, some information is sent to and received from Microsoft Intune. This information includes the User Principal Name (UPN) of all users that are assigned to the service and device inventory information for those devices that are managed by Microsoft Intune. Metadata, such as application name, publisher, and version, for content that is assigned to Manage.Microsoft.com distribution points is sent to Microsoft Intune. The actual binary content assigned to a Manage.Microsoft.com distribution point is encrypted before it is uploaded to Microsoft Intune.  

### Use of Information:  
 The information sent to Microsoft Intune is used only to provide and improve the Microsoft Intune services. No information about the content assigned to the distribution point is collected by Microsoft.  

### Security of Subscription-Related Data:  
 Content selected to be uploaded to the Manage.Microsoft.com distribution point is encrypted with a key that is unique to your organization's installation of Configuration Manager. Some content may be particularly sensitive to your organization or be subject to specific regulatory requirements. For more information, see the [Microsoft Intune Privacy Statement](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=262214).  

### Choice/Control:
