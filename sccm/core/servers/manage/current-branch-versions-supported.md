# Support for System Center Configuration Manager current branch versions
Microsoft plans to release updates for System Center Configuration Manager current branch a few times per year with each update version  supported for twelve (12) months from its general availability (GA) release date. Technical support will be provided for the entire twelve (12) months. However, our support structure is now dynamic, evolving into two distinct servicing phases that depend on the availability of the latest current branch version.  

-   Security and Critical Updates servicing phase - When running the latest current branch version of Configuration Manager, you will receive both Security and Critical updates.  

-   Security Updates (Only) servicing phase - After a new current branch version is released, support for older branches will reduce to Security updates only for the remainder of the twelve (12) month support lifecycle (shown in figure 1).

> [!NOTE]  
>  The latest current branch version is always in the Security and Critical Updates servicing phase. This means that in the event that you encounter a code defect that warrants a critical update, you must have the latest current branch version installed in order to receive a fix. All other supported current branch versions will only be eligible to receive security updates. All support ends after the twelve (12) month lifecycle for a current branch version has expired. At that time, customers must update to a supported current branch version.
