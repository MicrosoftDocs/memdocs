## Use delivery optimization for all Windows updates

Previously, Delivery Optimization could be leveraged only for express updates. With this technical preview, it’s now possible to use Delivery Optimization for the distribution of all Windows Update content for clients running Windows 10 version 1709 or later.

### Prerequisites

Enable the following [software updates client settings](/sccm/core/clients/deploy/about-client-settings#software-updates):

- **Allow clients to download delta content when available** set to **Yes**
- **Port that clients use to receive requests for delta content** set to 8005 (default) or a custom port number

Delivery Optimization must be enabled (default) and not bypassed. For more information, see [Windows Delivery Optimization](/sccm/sum/deploy-use/optimize-windows-10-update-delivery#windows-delivery-optimization).

### Log files

For clients running Windows 10 version 1709 or later, use the following log files to monitor delta downloads:

- WUAHandler.log
- DeltaDownload.log
