## Improvements to Office 365 ProPlus upgrade readiness dashboard
<!--4021125-->


We've made improvements to the **Office 365 ProPlus upgrade readiness** dashboard that released in [Technical Preview version 1904](/sccm/core/get-started/2019/technical-preview-1904#bkmk_o365). The following new tiles on this dashboard help you evaluate readiness:

- Deployment
- Macro advisories
- Top add-ins by count of version

In the Configuration Manager console, go to the **Software Library** workspace, expand **Office 365 Client Management**, and select the **Office 365 ProPlus Upgrade Readiness** node.
