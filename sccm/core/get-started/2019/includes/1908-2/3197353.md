## Optimizations to the CMPivot engine
<!--3197353-->
We've added some significant optimizations to the CMPivot engine that allows us to push more of the processing to the ConfigMgr client. The optimizations drastically reduce the network and server CPU load needed to run CMPivot queries. With these optimizations, we can now sift through gigabytes of client data in real time.

### Examples

You can search all event logs on all clients in your enterprise for authentication failures with the following query:

```
EventLog('Security')
| where  EventID == 4673
| summarize count() by Device
| order by count_ desc
```

Search for a file by hash:

```
Device 
| join kind=leftouter ( File('%windir%\\system32\\*.exe') 
| where Hash == 'A92056D772260B39A876D01552496B2F8B4610A0B1E084952FE1176784E2CE77') 
| project Device, MalwareFound = iif( isnull(FileName), 'No', 'Yes')
```
