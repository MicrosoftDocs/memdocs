## <a name="bkmk_osd"></a> Improvements to OS deployment
<!--3633146,3641475,3654172-->

This technical preview version includes the following improvements to OS deployment:

- Based on your [UserVoice feedback](https://configurationmanager.uservoice.com/forums/300492-ideas/suggestions/20361052-task-sequence-view-only-option), there's a new **View** action on task sequences. <!--3633146-->  

- Based on your [UserVoice feedback](https://configurationmanager.uservoice.com/forums/300492-ideas/suggestions/13880781-task-sequence-error-dialog-box-needs-to-show-step), the task sequence error dialog window now displays more information. It shows the name of the task sequence step that failed. <!--3641475-->  

- When you set the **OSDDoNotLogCommand** task sequence variable to true, now it also hides the command line from the Run Command Line step in the log file. It previously only masked the program name from the Install Package step in smsts.log.<!--3654172-->
