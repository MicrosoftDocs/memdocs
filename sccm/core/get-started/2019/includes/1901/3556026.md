## <a name="bkmk_lifecycle"></a> Office products on lifecycle dashboard
<!--3556026-->

The product lifecycle dashboard now includes information for installed versions of Office 2003 through Office 2016. Data shows up after the site runs the lifecycle summarization task, which is every 24 hours.

For more information on this dashboard, see [Use the Product Lifecycle dashboard](/sccm/core/clients/manage/asset-intelligence/product-lifecycle-dashboard).
