## <a name="bkmk_pod"></a> Dedicated monitoring for phased deployments
<!--3555949-->

Phased deployments now have their own dedicated monitoring node. This node makes it easier to identify phased deployments that you created and then navigate to the [phased deployment monitoring view](/sccm/osd/deploy-use/manage-monitor-phased-deployments#bkmk_monitor).


### Try it out!

Try to complete the tasks. Then send [Feedback](/sccm/core/understand/find-help#product-feedback) with your thoughts on the feature.

1. [Create a phased deployment](/sccm/osd/deploy-use/create-phased-deployment-for-task-sequence).  

2. In the Configuration Manager console, go to the **Monitoring** workspace.  

3. Select the **Phased Deployments** node. It shows the list of phased deployments.  

4. Select one of the phased deployments, and then choose **View phased deployment status** in the ribbon.
