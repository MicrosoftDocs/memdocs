## <a name="bkmk_mac"></a> Device view filtering by MAC address
<!--3600878-->

Based on your [UserVoice feedback](https://configurationmanager.uservoice.com/forums/300492-ideas/suggestions/14765880-console-device-view-should-allow-search-filter-by), you can now search for a MAC address in a device view of the Configuration Manager console. This property is useful for OS deployment administrators while troubleshooting PXE-based deployments.

Go to the **Assets and Compliance** workspace, and select the **Devices** node. You can also view the membership of a **Device Collection**. When you view a list of devices, add the **MAC Address** column to the view.
