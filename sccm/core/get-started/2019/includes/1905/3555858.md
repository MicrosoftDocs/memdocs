## <a name="bkmk_wdag"></a> Windows Defender Application Guard file trust criteria
<!--3555858-->
There is a new policy setting that enables users to trust files that normally open in Windows Defender Application Guard (WDAG). Upon successful completion, the files will open on the host device instead of in WDAG.
