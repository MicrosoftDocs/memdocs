## <a name="bkmk_winsku"></a> Support for Windows Virtual Desktop

<!--3556025-->

[Windows Virtual Desktop](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-desktop/) is a preview feature of Microsoft Azure and Microsoft 365. You can now use Configuration Manager technical preview to manage these virtual devices running Windows in Azure.

Similar to a terminal server, these virtual devices allow multiple concurrent active user sessions. To help with client performance, Configuration Manager now disables user policies on any device that allows these multiple user sessions. Even if you enable user policies, the client disables them by default on these devices, which include Windows Virtual Desktop and terminal servers.

The client only disables user policy when it detects this type of device during a new installation. For an existing client of this type that you update to this version, the previous behavior persists. On an existing device, it configures the user policy setting even if it detects that the device allows multiple user sessions.

If you require user policy in this scenario, and accept any potential performance impact, use the Configuration Manager SDK with the [SMS_PolicyAgentConfig server WMI class](/sccm/develop/reference/core/clients/config/sms_policyagentconfig-server-wmi-class). Set the new `PolicyEnableUserPolicyOnTS` property to `true`.
