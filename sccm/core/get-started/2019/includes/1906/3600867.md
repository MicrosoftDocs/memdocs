## RBAC on Folders

Based on your [UserVoice feedback](https://configurationmanager.uservoice.com/forums/300492-ideas/suggestions/8390346-rba-on-the-folder-level) you can now set security scopes on folders.  

### Try it out!

Try to complete the tasks. Then send [Feedback](/sccm/core/understand/find-help#product-feedback) with your thoughts on the feature.

1. In the Configuration Manager console, right-click on a folder. For example, right-click a folder under the **Task Sequences** node.
1. Select **Folder** then **Set Security Scopes**.
1. Choose the security scopes you want to apply then click **OK**.

If you're already in the folder, you can also click on **Set Security Scopes** in the ribbon.
