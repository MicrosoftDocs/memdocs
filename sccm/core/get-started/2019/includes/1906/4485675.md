## <a name="bkmk_tscache"></a> Clear app content from client cache during task sequence

<!--4485675-->

In the **Install Application** task sequence step, you can now delete the app content from the client cache after the step runs. This behavior is beneficial on devices with small hard drives or when installing lots of large apps in succession.

### Prerequisite

Update the target client to the latest version to support this new feature.

### Try it out!

Try to complete the tasks. Then send [Feedback](/sccm/core/understand/find-help#product-feedback) with your thoughts on the feature.

1. Edit an existing task sequence or [create a new custom task sequence](/sccm/osd/deploy-use/create-a-custom-task-sequence).

1. Add and configure the [Install Application](/sccm/osd/understand/task-sequence-steps#BKMK_InstallApplication) step.

1. On the step, enable the option to **Clear application content from cache after installing**.

1. [Deploy the task sequence](/sccm/osd/deploy-use/deploy-a-task-sequence) to the target client.
