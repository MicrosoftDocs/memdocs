## <a name="bkmk_posh"></a> Improvement to Run PowerShell Script task sequence step
<!--1359389-->
You can now directly enter Windows PowerShell code in the **Run PowerShell Script** step. This change lets you run PowerShell commands during a task sequence without first creating and distributing a package with the script.
