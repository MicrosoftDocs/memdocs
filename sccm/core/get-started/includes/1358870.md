## <a name="bkmk_dataw"></a> Improvement to data warehouse
<!--1358870-->

Based on your UserVoice feedback, you can now synchronize more tables from the site database to the [data warehouse](/sccm/core/servers/manage/data-warehouse). This change allows you to create more reports based on your business requirements.

### Try it out!

Try to complete the tasks. Then send [Feedback](/sccm/core/understand/find-help#product-feedback) with your thoughts on the feature.

1. In the Configuration Manager console, go to the **Administration** workspace. Expand **Site Configuration**, and select the **Servers and Site System Roles** node.  

2. Select the site system with the data warehouse service point role. In the Site System Roles pane at the bottom, select the **Data Warehouse service point** role. In the ribbon on the Site Role tab, select **Properties**.  

3. Switch to the **Synchronization Settings** tab. Select the option to **Select tables**.  

4. In the Database tables window, select the table names to synchronize to the data warehouse database. Use the filter to search by name, or select the drop-down list to choose specific groups.  

    > [!Note]  
    > You can't remove tables that the role selects by default.
