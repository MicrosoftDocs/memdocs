## <a name="bkmk_drivers"></a> Improvements to driver maintenance
<!--1358270-->

Driver packages now have additional metadata fields for **Manufacturer** and **Model**. Use these fields to tag driver packages with information to assist in general housekeeping, or to identify old and duplicate drivers that you can delete.

In the **Software Library** workspace, expand **Operating Systems**, and select the **Driver Packages** node. Select a driver package, and select **Properties** in the ribbon. On the **General** tab, select an existing value from the drop-down lists, or enter a string to create a new entry. 

In the **Driver Packages** node, these fields display in the list as the **Driver Manufacturer** and **Driver Model** columns. They can also be used as search criteria.
