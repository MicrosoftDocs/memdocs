## <a name="bkmk_cluster"></a> Site system on Windows cluster node
<!--1359132-->

The Configuration Manager setup process no longer blocks installation of the site server role on a computer with the Windows role for Failover Clustering. SQL Always On requires this role, so you couldn't colocate the site database on the site server. With this change, you can create a highly available site with fewer servers by using SQL Always On and a site server in passive mode. 

For more information, see [High availability options](/sccm/core/servers/deploy/configure/high-availability-options).
