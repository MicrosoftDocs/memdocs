## <a name="bkmk_bgoptions"></a> New boundary group options
<!--1358749-->

Boundary groups now include additional settings to give you more control over content distribution in your environment. This release adds the following options:

- **Prefer distribution points over peers with the same subnet**: By default, the management point prioritizes peer cache sources at the top of the list of content locations. This setting reverses that priority.  

- **Prefer cloud distribution points over distribution points**: If you have a branch office with a faster internet link, you can now prioritize cloud content.
