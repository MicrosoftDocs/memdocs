## <a name="bkmk_cmpivot"></a> Improvements to CMPivot
<!--1359068-->

CMPivot includes the following improvements:  
- [Scalar functions](#bkmk_cmpivot-functions)  
- [Rendering visualizations](#bkmk_cmpivot-charts)  
- [Hardware inventory](#bkmk_cmpivot-hinv)  
- [Scalar operators](#bkmk_cmpivot-operators)  
- [Query summary](#bkmk_cmpivot-summary)  

For more general information, see [CMPivot](/sccm/core/servers/manage/cmpivot).


### <a name="bkmk_cmpivot-functions"></a> Scalar functions
CMPivot supports the following scalar functions:
- **ago()**: Subtracts the given timespan from the current UTC clock time  
- **datetime_diff()**: Calculates the calendar difference between two datetime values  
- **now()**: Returns the current UTC clock time  
- **bin()**: Rounds values down to an integer multiple of a given bin size  

> [!Note]  
> The datetime data type represents an instant in time, typically expressed as a date and time of day. Time values are measured in 1-second units. A datetime value is always in the UTC time zone. Always express date time literals in ISO 8601 format, for example, `yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM:ss`  

#### Examples
- `datetime(2015-12-31 23:59:59.9)`: A specific date time literal   
- `now()`: The current time  
- `ago(1d)`: The current time minus one day  


### <a name="bkmk_cmpivot-charts"></a> Rendering visualizations

CMPivot now includes basic support for the Log Analytics [render operator](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/kusto/query/renderoperator). This support includes the following types:  
- **barchart**: First column is x-axis, and can be text, datetime or numeric. The second columns must be numeric and is displayed as a horizontal strip.  
- **columnchart**: Like barchart, with vertical strips instead of horizontal strips.  
- **piechart**: First column is color-axis, second column is numeric.  
- **timechart**: Line graph. First column is x-axis, and should be datetime. Second column is y-axis.  

#### Example: bar chart
The following query renders the most recently used applications as a bar chart:

```
CCMRecentlyUsedApplications
| summarize dcount( Device ) by ProductName
| top 10 by dcount_
| render barchart
```

#### Example: time chart
To render time charts, use the new **bin()** operator to group events in time. The following query shows when devices have started in the last seven days:

``` 
OperatingSystem 
| where LastBootUpTime <= ago(7d)
| summarize count() by bin(LastBootUpTime,1d)
| render timechart
```

#### Example: pie chart
The following query displays all OS versions in a pie chart:

```
OperatingSystem 
| summarize count() by Caption
| render piechart
```

### <a name="bkmk_cmpivot-hinv"></a> Hardware inventory
Use CMPivot to query any hardware inventory class. These classes include any custom extensions you make to hardware inventory. CMPivot immediately returns cached results from the last hardware inventory scan stored in the site database. At the same time, it updates the results if necessary with live data from any online clients.

The color saturation of the data in the results table or chart indicates if the data is live or cached. For example, dark blue is real-time data from an online client. Light blue is cached data.

#### Example
```
LogicalDisk
| summarize sum( FreeSpace ) by Device
| order by sum_ desc
| render columnchart
```

#### Limitations
- The following hardware inventory entities aren't supported:  
    - Array properties, for example IP address  
    - Real32/Real64 <!--example?-->  
    - Embedded object properties <!--example?-->  
- Inventory entity names must begin with a character
- You can't overwrite the built-in entities by creating an inventory entity of the same name  


### <a name="bkmk_cmpivot-operators"></a> Scalar operators
Based on your feedback, CMPivot includes the following scalar operators:  

> [!Note]  
> - LHS: string to the left of the operator  
> - RHS: string to the right of the operator  


|Operator|Description|Example (yields true)|
|--------|-----------|---------------------|
|==|Equals|`"aBc" == "aBc"`|
|!=|Not equals|`"abc" != "ABC"`|
|like|LHS contains a match for RHS|`"FabriKam" like "%Brik%"`|
|!like|LHS doesn't contain a match for RHS|`"Fabrikam" !like "%xyz%"`|
|contains|RHS occurs as a subsequence of LHS|`"FabriKam" contains "BRik"`|
|!contains|RHS doesn't occur in LHS|`"Fabrikam" !contains "xyz"`|
|startswith|RHS is an initial subsequence of LHS|`"Fabrikam" startswith "fab"`|
|!startswith|RHS isn't an initial subsequence of LHS|`"Fabrikam" !startswith "kam"`|
|endswith|RHS is a closing subsequence of LHS|`"Fabrikam" endswith "Kam"`|
|!endswith|RHS isn't a closing subsequence of LHS|`"Fabrikam" !endswith "brik"`|


### <a name="bkmk_cmpivot-summary"></a> Query summary
Select the **Query Summary** tab at the bottom of the CMPivot window. This status helps you identify clients that are offline, or troubleshoot errors that may occur. Select a value in the Count column to open a list of specific devices with that status. 

For example, select the count of devices with a Failure status. See the specific error message, and export a list of these devices. If the error is that a specific cmdlet isn't recognized, create a collection from the exported device list to deploy a Windows PowerShell update.
