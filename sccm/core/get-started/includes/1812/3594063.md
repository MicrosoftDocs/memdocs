## <a name="bkmk_email"></a> Improvements to application approvals via email
<!--3594063-->
This release has improvements to the feature to receive [email notifications](/sccm/apps/deploy-use/app-approval#bkmk_email-approve) for application requests. Users have always had the ability to add a comment to the request from Software Center. This comment shows on the application request in the Configuration Manager console. Now that comment also shows in the email. Including this comment in the email helps the approvers make a better decision to approve or deny the request.
