## <a name="bkmk_insights"></a> Management insights rule for peer cache source client version
<!-- 1358008 -->

  [Management insights]( /sccm/core/servers/manage/management-insights) has a new rule to identify clients that serve as a peer cache source but haven't upgraded from a pre-1806 client version.  Pre-1806 clients can't be used as a peer cache source for clients that run version 1806 or later.

The new rule is **Upgrade peer cache sources to the latest version of the Configuration Manager client**, and is part of the new **Content** rule group.
