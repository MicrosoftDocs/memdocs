# Manage devices for On-premises Mobile Device Management

*Applies to: System Center Configuration Manager (Current Branch)*

You can manage computers and devices with System Center Configuration Manager On-premises Mobile Device Management (MDM). To do so, the [devices need to be enrolled](enroll-devices-on-premises-mdm.md) so that Configuration Manager can communicate with the devices for management tasks.

Managing devices in on-premises MDM is the same as managing devices in a hybrid MDM environment. [Manage devices in hybrid MDM](wipe-lock-reset-devices.md) provides detailed information about device management.
