# Verify MDM configuration with System Center Configuration Manager

*Applies to: System Center Configuration Manager (Current Branch)*

You can verify certain device management components by checking the following log files:

-   Check the Cloudusersync.log to verify that user accounts are successfully synchronized.

-   Check the Sitecomp.log to verify that the service connection point was created successfully.

You can review [Log files in System Center Configuration Manager](../../core/plan-design/hierarchy/log-files.md##BKMK_FunctionLogs) for more information about these specific log files and how to view them.
