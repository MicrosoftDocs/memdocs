# Enroll user-owned devices for hybrid deployments with Configuration Manager

*Applies to: System Center Configuration Manager (Current Branch)*

User-owned devices, often called "bring your own device" or simply BYOD, can be brought into management by installing the Company Portal app (iOS, macOS, and Android) or adding a Work or School account to a device so the device joins a domain (Windows).  

To bring devices into management, as an admin you must first [set up mobile device management](setup-hybrid-mdm.md) and [enable enrollment](enable-platform-enrollment.md). Once enrollment is enabled, users can enroll their own devices.

Companies or schools that purchase devices can use programs that let you [manage company owned devices](enroll-company-owned-devices.md).

[Resources about the end-user experience with Microsoft Intune](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/intune/deploy-use/what-to-tell-your-end-users-about-using-microsoft-intune) reviews some of the steps that end users take to do different tasks in Intune after they enroll their devices.
