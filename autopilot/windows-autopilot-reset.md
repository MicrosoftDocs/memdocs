# Windows Autopilot Reset

Windows Autopilot Reset takes the device back to a business-ready state, allowing the next user to sign in and get productive quickly and simply. Specifically, Windows Autopilot Reset:

- Removes personal files, apps, and settings.
- Reapplies a device's original settings.
- Sets the region, language, and keyboard to the original values.
- Maintains the device's identity connection to Microsoft Entra ID.
- Maintains the device's management connection to Intune.

The Windows Autopilot Reset process automatically keeps information from the existing device:

- Wi-Fi connection details.
- Provisioning packages previously applied to the device.
- A provisioning package present on a USB drive when the reset process is started.
- Microsoft Entra device membership and mobile device management (MDM) enrollment information.
- Simple Certificate Enrollment Protocol (SCEP) certificates.

Windows Autopilot Reset blocks the user from accessing the desktop until this information is restored, including reapplying any provisioning packages. For devices enrolled in an MDM service, Windows Autopilot Reset also blocks until an MDM sync is completed.

> [!NOTE]
>
> Autopilot Reset doesn't support Microsoft Entra hybrid joined devices. For Microsoft Entra hybrid joined devices, a full device wipe is required. When a hybrid device goes through a full device reset, it might take up to 24 hours for it to be ready to be deployed again. The request can be expedited by re-registering the device.

## Scenarios

Windows Autopilot Reset supports two scenarios:

- [Local reset](#reset-devices-with-local-windows-autopilot-reset) started by IT personnel or other administrators from the organization.
- [Remote reset](#reset-devices-with-remote-windows-autopilot-reset) started remotely by IT personnel via an MDM service such as Microsoft Intune.

Additional requirements and configuration details apply with each scenario.

## Reset devices with local Windows Autopilot Reset

IT admins can use a local Windows Autopilot Reset to:

- Quickly remove personal files, apps, and settings.
- Reset Windows devices from the lock screen.
- Apply original settings and management enrollment (Microsoft Entra ID and device management).

The device is then ready to use. With a local Autopilot Reset, devices are returned to a fully configured or known IT-approved state.

To enable local Autopilot Reset in supported versions of Windows:

1. [Enable the policy for the feature](#enable-local-windows-autopilot-reset).
1. [Trigger a reset for each device](#trigger-local-windows-autopilot-reset).

### Enable local Windows Autopilot Reset

To enable a local Windows Autopilot Reset, the **DisableAutomaticReDeploymentCredentials** policy must be configured. This policy is documented in the [CredentialProviders](/windows/client-management/mdm/policy-csp-credentialproviders), **CredentialProviders/DisableAutomaticReDeploymentCredentials** configuration service provider (CSP) policy. By default, local Windows Autopilot Reset is disabled. This default ensures that a local Autopilot Reset isn't triggered accidentally.

The policy can be set using one of these methods:

- MDM provider.

  - When Intune is used, a new device configuration profile can be created with the following settings:

    - **Platform** = **Windows 10 or later**.
    - **Profile type** = **Device restrictions**.
    - **Category** = **General**.
    - **Autopilot Reset** = **Allow**. Deploy this setting to all devices where a local reset should be permitted.

  - If using an MDM provider other than Intune, check the MDM provider's documentation on how to set this policy.

- Windows Configuration Designer.

[Windows Configuration Designer](/windows/configuration/provisioning-packages/provisioning-create-package) can be used to set the **Runtime settings > Policies > CredentialProviders > DisableAutomaticReDeploymentCredentials** setting to `0` and then create a provisioning package.

- Set up School PCs app.

 The latest release of the **Set up School PCs** app supports enabling local Windows Autopilot Reset.

### Trigger local Windows Autopilot Reset

A local Windows Autopilot Reset is a two-step process:

1. Trigger the Windows Autopilot Reset.
1. Authenticate.

Once these two steps are performed, the Windows Autopilot Reset executes. Once the Windows Autopilot Reset is done, the device is again ready for use.

**To trigger a local Autopilot Reset:**

On the device where the local Windows Autopilot reset is being performed:

1. If a provisioning package was created, plug in the USB drive that contains the provisioning package.

1. From the Windows device lock screen, enter the keystroke <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>WIN</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd>.

    These keystrokes open up a custom sign-in screen for the local Autopilot Reset. The screen serves two purposes:

    1. Confirm/verify that the end user has the right to trigger Local Autopilot Reset.
    1. Notify the user in case a provisioning package, created using Windows Configuration Designer, is being used as part of the process.

1. To trigger the local Autopilot Reset, sign into the device with an account that has local admin credentials.

 Once the local Autopilot Reset is triggered, the reset process starts. Once provisioning is complete, the device is again ready for use.

> [!NOTE]
>
> When local Autopilot Reset is used on a device, the device's primary user and the Microsoft Entra device owner aren't updated. Admins can update them manually after the Autopilot Reset completes.

## Reset devices with remote Windows Autopilot Reset

An MDM service such a Microsoft Intune can be used to start the remote Windows Autopilot reset process. Resetting in this way avoids the need for IT staff to visit each machine to start the process.

To enable a device for a remote Windows Autopilot Reset, the device must be MDM managed and joined to Microsoft Entra ID. Additionally, for Intune, the Intune Service Administrator role is required for remote Windows Autopilot Reset. For more information, see [Add users and grant administrative permission to Intune](/mem/intune/fundamentals/users-add).

### Triggering a remote Windows Autopilot Reset

To trigger a remote Windows Autopilot Reset via Intune, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to **Devices** tab in the Intune admin center.
1. In the **All devices** view, select the targeted reset devices and then select **More** to view device actions.
1. Select **Autopilot Reset** to start the reset task.

Once the reset is complete, the device is again ready for use.

> [!NOTE]
>
> When remote Autopilot Reset is used on a device, the device's primary user and the Microsoft Entra device owner is removed. The next user who signs in after the reset will be set as the primary user and Microsoft Entra device owner. Shared devices will remain shared after the Autopilot Reset.

## Troubleshooting

Windows Autopilot Reset requires that the [Windows Recovery Environment (WinRE)](/windows-hardware/manufacture/desktop/windows-recovery-environment--windows-re--technical-reference) is correctly configured and enabled on the device. Before the Windows Autopilot Reset is started, it checks if WinRE is configured and enabled. If WinRE isn't configured and enabled, then the Windows Autopilot reset fails immediately on the device and an error such as `Error code: ERROR_NOT_SUPPORTED (0x80070032)` is reported in the logs.

To make sure WinRE is enabled, use the [REAgentC.exe tool](/windows-hardware/manufacture/desktop/reagentc-command-line-options) to run the following command:

```cmd
reagentc.exe /enable
```

If Windows Autopilot Reset fails after enabling WinRE, or WinRE can't be enabled, contact [Microsoft Support](https://support.microsoft.com) for assistance.
