## Known issues

### DFCI enrollment fails for Professional editions of Windows 11, version 24H2

Date added: *October 9, 2024*

DFCI can't currently be used on devices with Professional editions of Windows 11, version 24H2. The issue is being investigated. As a workaround, ensure the device is upgraded to the Enterprise edition of Windows 11, version 24H2 during or after OOBE onboarding. After upgrading to the Enterprise edition of Windows 11, version 24H2, sync the device. Once the device is synced, reboot it to get it enrolled in DFCI.

### Autopilot deployment report doesn't support sorting

Date added: *August 29, 2024*

The Autopilot deployment report was updated to a new infrastructure that doesn't currently support column sorting. The issue will be addressed in the future.

<!-- MAXADO-9270654 -->

### Auto logon for Kiosk device profile only partially fixed

Date added: *August 21, 2024*

The know issue of [Kiosk device profiles not auto logging in when auto logon was enabled](#kiosk-device-profile-not-auto-logging-in) was previously reported as fixed. However, there are scenarios where the issue might still occur when using autologon with Kiosks and [Assigned Access](/windows/configuration/assigned-access/overview). If multiple reboots or unexpected reboots occur during the Windows out-of-box experience (OOBE) when initially configuring the Kiosk, the autologon entries in the registry might be deleted. The issue is being investigated.

The following workarounds are available until the issue is resolved:

1. Apply or reapply the kiosk profile after Windows Autopilot completes.

1. Apply the autologon registry entries either manually or via a script. For example:

    ```cmd
    reg.exe add "HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon" /v "AutoAdminLogon" /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f

    reg.exe add "HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon" /v "DefaultDomainName" /t REG_SZ /d "." /f

    reg.exe add "HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon" /v "DefaultUserName" /t REG_SZ /d "kioskUser0" /f
    ```

1. Exclude items the required reboots during OOBE from Windows Autopilot.

1. Manually enter the kiosk user credentials.

For more information, see [Assigned Access recommendations - Automatic sign-in](/windows/configuration/assigned-access/recommendations#automatic-sign-in). For additional assistance, contact support.

## BitLocker encryption defaults to 128-bit when 256-bit encryption is configured

Date added: *July 8, 2024*

In some Windows Autopilot deployments of unregistered devices, BitLocker encryption might default to 128-bit even though the admin configured 256-bit encryption due to a known race condition. The issue is being investigated. Microsoft recommends that customers who need 256-bit BitLocker encryption register devices for Autopilot.

### Required apps aren't shown on the Enrollment Status Page (ESP) after an Autopilot Reset

Date added: *May 17, 2024*

When an Autopilot Reset happens, the required apps aren't installed on the Enrollment Status Page (ESP) before the user reaches the desktop. The apps aren't tracked on the ESP, but the apps are installed when the user signs in to the desktop.

### Enrolled date for Autopilot device is incorrect

Date added: *November 1, 2023*

The **Enrolled date** in the **Devices | All devices** and **Windows | Windows devices** panes display the date the device was registered to Autopilot instead of the date it was enrolled to Autopilot. For a more accurate date for when the device enrolled to the tenant:

1. Use the Intune Graph API to query the device:

    `devices?$filter=physicalIds/any(p: startswith(p, '[ZTDID]'))&$select=id,deviceId,displayName,physicalIds,createdDateTime`

    For more information, see [Intune devices and apps API overview](/graph/intune-concept-overview) and [Working with Intune in Microsoft Graph](/graph/api/resources/intune-graph-overview).

1. Use the Windows Autopilot deployment report for recently deployed devices.

### Filtering Windows Autopilot devices not working as expected

Date added: *July 14, 2023*

Viewing Windows Autopilot devices within Intune might not work as expected if attempting to filter results. While this issue is being worked on, a workaround is to use [Microsoft Graph API](/graph/use-the-api) to properly query and filter necessary devices.

### TPM attestation isn't working on some platforms with Infineon SLB9672 discrete TPMs

Date added: *June 2, 2023*

Platforms with the Infineon SLB9672 TPM with firmware release 15.22 with EK certificate might fail with error message **Something happened, and TPM attestation timed out.** To resolve this issue, contact the OEM for an update.

### Kiosk device profile not auto logging in

Date added: *January 30, 2023*<br>
Date updated: *August 21, 2024*

There's currently a known issue in the following Windows Updates released in January 2023:

- Windows 11, version 22H2: [KB5022303](https://support.microsoft.com/topic/january-10-2023-kb5022303-os-build-22621-1105-c45956c6-4ccb-4216-832c-2ec6309c7629)
- Windows 11, version 21H2: [KB5022287](https://support.microsoft.com/topic/january-10-2023-kb5022287-os-build-22000-1455-951898ec-2628-4d25-850e-9a44207bc139)
- Windows 10, version 22H2: [KB5022282](https://support.microsoft.com/topic/january-10-2023-kb5022282-os-builds-19042-2486-19044-2486-and-19045-2486-9587e4e3-c2d7-48a6-86e2-8cd9146b47fd)

If these updates are installed on a device, Kiosk device profiles that have auto logon enabled won't auto log on. After Autopilot completes provisioning, the device stays on the sign-in screen prompting for credentials. To work around this known issue, manually enter the kiosk user credentials with the username `kioskUser0` and no password. After the username is entered with no password, it should go to the desktop. This issue should be resolved in cumulative updates released for Windows 11 in April 2023 and Windows 10 in March 2023:

- Windows 11, version 22H2: [KB5025239](https://support.microsoft.com/topic/april-11-2023-kb5025239-os-build-22621-1555-5eaaaf42-bc4d-4881-8d38-97e0082a6982) or later.
- Windows 11, version 21H2: [KB5025224](https://support.microsoft.com/topic/april-11-2023-kb5025224-os-build-22000-1817-ebc75372-608d-4a77-a6e0-cb1e15f117fc) or later.
- Windows 10, version 22H2: [KB5023773](https://support.microsoft.com/topic/march-21-2023-kb5023773-os-builds-19042-2788-19044-2788-and-19045-2788-preview-5850ac11-dd43-4550-89ec-9e63353fef23) or later.

> [!NOTE]
>
> This issue was only partially fixed and can still occur under certain conditions. For more information, see [Auto logon for Kiosk device profile only partially fixed](#auto-logon-for-kiosk-device-profile-only-partially-fixed).

### TPM attestation isn't working on AMD platforms with ASP fTPM

Date added: *December 1, 2022*

TPM attestation for AMD platforms with ASP firmware TPM might fail with error code 0x80070490 on Windows systems. This issue is resolved on later versions of AMD firmware. Consult with device manufacturers and firmware release notes for which firmware versions contain the update.

### TPM attestation failure with error code 0x81039001

Date added: *October 6, 2022*

Some devices might intermittently fail TPM attestation during Windows Autopilot pre-provisioning technician flow or self-deployment mode with the error code **0x81039001 E_AUTOPILOT_CLIENT_TPM_MAX_ATTESTATION_RETRY_EXCEEDED**. This failure occurs during the **Securing your hardware** step for Windows Autopilot devices deployed using self-deploying mode or pre-provisioning mode. Subsequent attempts to provision might resolve the issue.

### Autopilot deployment report shows "failure" status on a successful deployment

Date added: *September 22, 2022*

The Autopilot deployment report (preview) shows a failed status for any device that experiences an initial deployment failure. For subsequent deployment attempts, using the **Try again** or **Continue to desktop** options, the deployment state in the report doesn't update. If the user resets the device, a new deployment row is shown in the report with the previous attempt remaining as failed.

### Autopilot deployment report doesn't show deployed device

Date added: *September 22, 2022*

Autopilot deployments that take longer than one hour might display an incomplete deployment status in the deployment report. If the device successfully enrolls but doesn't complete provisioning after more than one hour, the device status might not be updated in the report.

### Autopilot profile not being applied when assigned

Date added: *June 15, 2022*

In Windows 10, version 21H2 April 2022 and some May 2022 update releases, there's an issue where the Autopilot profile might fail to apply to the device. Additionally, the hardware hash might not be harvested. As a result, any settings made in the profile might not be configured for the user such as device renaming. To resolve this issue, apply [KB5015020](https://support.microsoft.com/topic/may-19-2022-kb5015020-os-builds-19042-1708-19043-1708-and-19044-1708-out-of-band-9b5bd38a-ab3c-4ada-96b0-b754134fcd2a) cumulative update or later to the device.

### DefaultuserX profile not deleted

Date added: *March 28, 2022*

When the [EnableWebSignIn CSP](/windows/client-management/mdm/policy-csp-authentication#authentication-enablewebsignin) is used, the `defaultuserX` profile might not be deleted.

### Autopilot reset ran into trouble. Could not find the recovery environment

Date added: *March 28, 2022*

When an Autopilot reset is attempted, the following message is displayed:

> **Autopilot reset ran into trouble. Could not find the recovery environment**

If there isn't an issue with the recovery environment, enter administrator credentials to continue with the reset process.

### Device-based Conditional Access policies

Date added: *March 3, 2022*

1. The Intune Enrollment app must be excluded from any Conditional Access policy requiring **Terms of Use** because it isn't supported. See [Per-device terms of use](/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/terms-of-use#per-device-terms-of-use).

1. Exceptions to Conditional Access policies to exclude **Microsoft Intune Enrollment** and **Microsoft Intune** cloud apps are needed to complete Autopilot enrollment in cases where restrictive polices are present such as:

    - Conditional Access policy 1: Block all apps except those apps on an exclusion list.
    - Conditional Access policy 2: Require a compliant device for the apps on the exclusion list.

    In this case, Microsoft Intune Enrollment and Microsoft Intune should be included in that exclusion list of policy 1.

    If a policy is in place such that **all cloud apps** require a compliant device (there's no exclusion list), by default Microsoft Intune Enrollment is excluded, so that the device can register with Microsoft Entra ID and enroll with Intune and avoid a circular dependency.

1. **Hybrid Microsoft Entra devices**: When Hybrid Microsoft Entra devices are deployed with Autopilot, two device IDs are initially associated with the same device - one Microsoft Entra ID and one hybrid. The hybrid compliance state displays as **N/A** when viewed from the devices list in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) until a user signs in. Intune only syncs with the Hybrid device ID after a successful user sign-in.

    The temporary **N/A** compliance state can cause issues with device based Conditional Access polices that block access based on compliance. In this case, this behavior of Conditional Access is intended. To resolve the conflict, a user must to sign in to the device, or the device-based policy must be modified. For more information, see [Conditional Access: Require compliant or Microsoft Entra hybrid joined device](/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/howto-conditional-access-policy-compliant-device).

1. Conditional Access policies such as BitLocker compliance require a grace period for Autopilot devices. This grace period is needed because until the device is rebooted, the status of BitLocker and Secure Boot aren't captured. Since the status isn't't captured, it can't be used as part of the Compliance Policy. The grace period can be as short as 0.25 days.

### Device goes through Autopilot deployment without an assigned profile

Date added: *March 2, 2022*

When a device is registered in Autopilot and no profile is assigned, the default Autopilot profile is taken. This behavior is by design. It makes sure that all devices registered with Autopilot go through the Autopilot experience. If the device shouldn't go through an Autopilot deployment, remove the Autopilot registration.

### White screen during Microsoft Entra hybrid joined deployment

Date added: *February 19, 2022*

There's a UI bug on Autopilot Microsoft Entra hybrid joined deployments where the Enrollment Status page is displayed as a white screen. This issue is limited to the UI and shouldn't affect the deployment process.

This issue was resolved in September 2022.

### Virtual machine failing at "Preparing your device for mobile management"

Date added: *February 19, 2022*

When trying to use Windows Autopilot on a virtual machine (VM), the following error might occur:

> **"Preparing your device for mobile management**

To resolve the issue, make sure the virtual machine is configured with a minimum of 2 processors and 4 GB of memory.

### ODJConnectorSvc.exe leaks memory

Date added: *February 19, 2022*

When a proxy server is used with the ODJConnector service, the memory file can get too large when processing requests resulting in impacts to performance. The current workaround for this issue is to restart the ODJConnectSvc.exe service.

### Reset button causes pre-provisioning to fail on retry

Date added: *February 19, 2022*

When ESP fails during the pre-provisioning flow and the user selects the reset button, TPM attestation might fail during the retry.

### TPM attestation failure on Windows 11 error code 0x81039023

Date added: *February 19, 2022*

Some devices might fail TPM attestation on Windows 11 during the pre-provisioning technician flow or self-deployment mode with the error code **0x81039023**. To resolve the issue, apply the May 2022 cumulative update for Windows 11, version 21H2 [KB5013943](https://support.microsoft.com/topic/may-10-2022-kb5013943-os-build-22000-675-14aa767a-aa87-414e-8491-b6e845541755) or later to the device.

### Duplicate device objects with Microsoft Entra hybrid deployments

Date added: *January 9, 2022*

A device object is pre-created in Microsoft Entra ID once a device is registered in Autopilot. If a device goes through a hybrid Microsoft Entra deployment, by design, another device object is created resulting in duplicate entries.

### TPM attestation failure on Windows 11 error code 0x81039024

Date added: *December 8, 2021*

Some devices might fail TPM attestation on Windows 11 during the pre-provisioning technician flow or self-deployment mode with the error code 0x81039024. This error code indicates that there are known vulnerabilities detected with the TPM and as a result attestation fails. If this error occurs, visit the PC manufacturer's website to update the TPM firmware.

### Delete device record in Intune before reusing devices in self-deployment mode or Pre-Provisioning mode

Devices are enrolled using Autopilot self-deployment mode or pre-provisioning mode. If a device is redeployed so that it reruns the Autopilot deployment again, it fails with a `0x80180014` error code.

To resolve this error, use one of the following work around methods:

- Delete the device record in Intune, and then redeploy the device so that it reruns the Autopilot deployment. For more information, see [Deregister a device](registration-overview.md#deregister-a-device).
- Remove the device enrollment restriction for **Windows (MDM)** personally owned devices. For more information, see [Set enrollment restrictions in Microsoft Intune](/mem/intune/enrollment/enrollment-restrictions-set).<!-- MEMDocs #2748 -->

For more information on this issue, see [Troubleshooting Windows Autopilot device import and enrollment](troubleshooting-faq.yml#troubleshooting-windows-autopilot-device-import-and-enrollment).

### A non-assigned user can sign in when using user-driven mode with Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS)

In a Windows Autopilot user-driven Microsoft Entra joined environment, a user can be pre-assigned to a device. If the user is a cloud-native Microsoft Entra account, the username is enforced and the user is only asked for their password. There's no way to sign in with another user ID. However, when ADFS is used, the username assignment isn't enforced. A different user than the one assigned can sign in on the device.

### Intune connector is inactive but still appears in the Intune Connectors

Inactive Intune connectors will be automatically cleaned up after 30 days of inactivity without admin interaction.

### Autopilot sign-in page displays HTML tags from company branding settings

When [customizations are applied to the company branding settings](/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/customize-branding#to-customize-your-branding), the HTML tags might be visible and not rendered correctly on the update password page. This issue should be fixed in future versions of Windows.

### TPM attestation isn't working on Intel Tiger Lake platforms

TPM attestation support for Intel firmware TPM Tiger Lake platforms on devices with Windows 10, version 21H2 require the November 2021 cumulative update [KB5007253](https://support.microsoft.com/topic/november-22-2021-kb5007253-os-builds-19041-1387-19042-1387-19043-1387-and-19044-1387-preview-d1847be9-46c1-49fc-bf56-1d469fc1b3af) or later. Older versions of Windows aren't supported.

### Blocking apps specified in a user-targeted Enrollment Status Profile are ignored during device ESP

The services responsible for determining the list of apps that should be blocking during device ESP aren't able to determine the correct ESP profile containing the list of apps because they don't know the user identity. As a workaround, enable the default ESP profile (which targets all users and devices) and place the blocking app list there. To avoid this issue, target the ESP profile to [device groups](enrollment-autopilot.md).

### That username looks like it belongs to another organization. Try signing in again or start over with a different account

Confirm that all of the information is correct in the registry key:

`HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Provisioning\Diagnostics\Autopilot`

For more information, see [Where are the Windows Autopilot profile settings received from the Windows Autopilot deployment service stored?](troubleshooting-faq.yml#where-are-the-windows-autopilot-profile-settings-received-from-the-windows-autopilot-deployment-service-stored-).

### Windows Autopilot user-driven hybrid Microsoft Entra deployments don't grant users Administrator rights even when specified in the Windows Autopilot profile

This issue occurs when there's another user on the device that already has Administrator rights. For example, a PowerShell script or policy could create another local account that is a member of the Administrators group. To ensure this works properly, don't create another account until after the Windows Autopilot process is complete.

### Windows Autopilot device provisioning can fail

These failures might be because of TPM attestation errors or ESP timeouts on devices where the real-time clock is off by a significant amount of time. For example, several minutes or more.

To fix this issue:

- Boot the device to the start of the out-of-box experience (OOBE).
- Establish a network connection (wired or wireless).
- Run the command `w32tm /resync /force` to sync the time with the default time server (`time.windows.com`).

### Windows Autopilot for existing devices doesn't work

During a Windows Autopilot for existing devices deployment, screens that are disabled in the Windows Autopilot profile are shown, such as the Windows License Agreement screen.

This issue happens because Windows deletes the `AutopilotConfigurationFile.json` file when `Sysprep.exe` runs with the `/Generalize` parameter. The **Prepare Windows for Capture** task in a Configuration Manager task sequence runs `Sysprep.exe` with the `/Generalize` parameter.

To fix this issue:

- Edit the Configuration Manager task sequence and disable the **Prepare Windows for Capture** step.
- Add a new **Run command-line** step that runs the following command:

  ```cmd
  C:\Windows\System32\sysprep\sysprep.exe /oobe /reboot
  ```

For more information, see [Modify the task sequence to account for Sysprep command line configuration](tutorial/existing-devices/create-autopilot-task-sequence.md#modify-the-task-sequence-to-account-for-sysprep-command-line-configuration) and [Prepare Windows for Capture](/mem/configmgr/osd/understand/task-sequence-steps#prepare-windows-for-capture).

### Windows Autopilot self-deploying mode fails with an error code

For more information on this scenario, see [Windows Autopilot self-deploying mode](self-deploying.md).

| Error code | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| **0x800705B4** | This general error indicates a timeout. A common cause of this error in self-deploying mode is that the device isn't TPM 2.0 capable. For example, it's a virtual machine. Devices that aren't TPM 2.0 capable can't be used with self-deploying mode. |
| **0x801c03ea** | This error indicates that TPM attestation failed, causing a failure to join Microsoft Entra ID with a device token. |
| **0xc1036501** | The device can't do an automatic MDM enrollment because there are multiple MDM configurations in Microsoft Entra ID. |

### Pre-provisioning gives an error screen and the **Microsoft-Windows-User Device Registration/Admin** event log displays **HResult error code 0x801C03F3**

This issue can happen if Microsoft Entra ID can't find a Microsoft Entra device object for the device that is being deployed. This issue occurs the object was manually deleted. To fix it, remove the device from Microsoft Entra ID, Intune, and Autopilot, then re-register it with Autopilot, which recreates the Microsoft Entra device object. For more information, see [Deregister a device](registration-overview.md#deregister-a-device).

To get troubleshooting logs, run the following command:

```cmd
Mdmdiagnosticstool.exe -area Autopilot;TPM -cab c:\autopilot.cab
```

### Pre-provisioning gives an error screen

Pre-provisioning isn't supported on a VM.

### Error importing Windows Autopilot devices from a .csv file

Ensure that the .csv file isn't edited in Microsoft Excel or an editor other than Notepad. Some of these editors can introduce extra characters causing the file format to be invalid.

### Windows Autopilot for existing devices doesn't follow the Autopilot OOBE experience

Ensure that the JSON profile file is saved in **ANSI/ASCII** format, not Unicode or UTF-8.

### **Something went wrong** is displayed page during OOBE

The client is likely unable to access all the required Microsoft Entra ID/MSA-related URLs. For more information, see [Networking requirements](requirements.md?tabs=networking).

### Using a provisioning package in combination with Windows Autopilot can cause issues, especially if the PPKG contains join, enrollment, or device name information

Using PPKGs in combination with Windows Autopilot isn't recommended.
