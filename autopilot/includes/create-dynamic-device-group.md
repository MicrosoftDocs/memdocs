            The most common type of dynamic device group when using Windows Autopilot is a device group that contains all Windows Autopilot devices. A dynamic device group that contains all Windows Autopilot devices has the following syntax:

            `(device.devicePhysicalIDs -any (_ -startsWith "[ZTDid]"))`

            To enter in this rule:

            1. Select the **Edit** option in the **Rule syntax** section.

            1. Paste in the following rule in the **Edit rule syntax** screen under **Rule syntax**:

                `(device.devicePhysicalIDs -any (_ -startsWith "[ZTDid]"))`

            1. Once the rule is pasted in, select **OK**.

        1. Once the desired rule is entered, select **Save** on the toolbar to close the **Dynamic membership rules** window.

            For more information on creating rules for dynamic groups, see [Dynamic membership rules for groups in Microsoft Entra ID](/azure/active-directory/enterprise-users/groups-dynamic-membership).

    1. Select **Create** to finish creating the dynamic device group.

> [!NOTE]
>
> The above steps are creating a dynamic group in Microsoft Entra that is used by Intune and Windows Autopilot solutions. Although the groups can be accessed in the Intune portal, they're Microsoft Entra groups.

> [!TIP]
>
> For Configuration Manager admins, device groups are similar to device based collections. Dynamic device groups are similar to query based device collections while assigned device groups are similar to direct membership device collections.
