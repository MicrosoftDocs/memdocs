Whenever a device permanently leaves an organization, whether it's for a repair or the end of the device life cycle, the device should always be deregistered from Autopilot.

Below we describe the steps an admin would go through to deregister a device from Intune and Autopilot.

### Delete from Intune

Before a device is deregistered from Autopilot, it first has to be deleted from Intune. To delete an Autopilot device from Intune:

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431).

2. In the **Home** screen, select **Devices** in the left pane.

3. In the **Devices | Overview** screen, under **By platform**, select **Windows**.

4. Under **Device name**, find the device that needs to be deleted and then select the device. If necessary, use the **Search** box.

5. In the properties screen for the device, make a note of the serial number listed under **Serial number**.

6. After making a note of the serial number of the device, select **Delete** in the toolbar at the top of the page.

7. A warning dialog box appears to confirm the deletion of the device from Intune. Select **Yes** to confirm deleting the device.

### Deregister from Autopilot using Intune

Once the device has been deleted from Intune, it can then be deregistered from Autopilot. To deregister a device from Autopilot:

1. Make sure the device has been deleted from Intune as described in the [Delete from Intune](#delete-from-intune) section.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431).

1. In the **Home** screen, select **Devices** in the left pane.

1. In the **Devices | Overview** screen, under **By platform**, select **Windows**.

1. In the **Windows | Windows enrollment** screen, select **Windows enrollment**

1. Under **Windows Autopilot Deployment Program**, select **Devices**.

1. In the **Windows Autopilot devices** screen that opens, under **Serial number**, find the device that needs to be deregistered by its serial number as determined in the [Delete from Intune](#delete-from-intune) section. If necessary, use the **Search by serial number** box.

1. Select the device by selecting the checkbox next to the device.

1. Select the extended menu icon (`â€¦`) on the far right end of the line containing the device. A menu appears with the option **Unassign user**.

   - If the **Unassign user** option is available and not greyed out, then select it. A warning dialog box appears confirming to unassign the user from the device. Select **OK** to confirm unassigning the device from the user.
   - If the **Unassign user** option isn't available and greyed out, then move on to the next step.

1. With the device still selected, select **Delete** in the toolbar at the top of the page.

1. A warning dialog box appears to confirm the deletion of the device from Autopilot. Select **Yes** to confirm deleting the device.

1. The deregistration process may take some time. The process can be accelerated by selecting the **Sync** button in the toolbar at the top of the page.

1. Every few minutes select **Refresh** in the toolbar at the top of the page until the device is no longer present.

> - For Microsoft Entra join devices, no additional steps are necessary to remove the device from Intune and Autopilot. Unneeded steps include manually deleting the device from Microsoft Entra ID. Manually deleting the device from Microsoft Entra ID may cause unexpected problems, issues, and behavior. If needed, the device will be automatically removed from Microsoft Entra ID after these steps are followed.
>
> - For Microsoft Entra hybrid join devices, delete the computer object from the on-premises Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) environment. Deleting the computer object from the on-premises AD DS ensures that the computer object isn't resynced back to Microsoft Entra ID. After the computer object is deleted from the on-premises AD DS environment, no additional steps are necessary to remove the device from Intune and Autopilot. Unneeded steps include manually deleting the device from Microsoft Entra ID. Manually deleting the device from Microsoft Entra ID may cause unexpected problems, issues, and behavior. If needed, the device will be automatically removed from Microsoft Entra ID after these steps are followed.

The above steps deregister the device from Autopilot, unenroll the device from Intune, and disjoin the device from Microsoft Entra ID. It may appear that only deregistering the device from Autopilot is needed. However, there are barriers in Intune that require all the above steps to avoid problems with lost or unrecoverable devices. To prevent the possibility of orphaned devices in the Autopilot database, Intune, or Microsoft Entra ID, it's best to complete all the steps. If a device gets into an unrecoverable state, you can contact the appropriate [Microsoft support alias](../autopilot-support.md) for assistance.

### Deregister from Autopilot using Microsoft 365 admin center

The device can be deregistered from Autopilot in Microsoft 365 admin center if using Microsoft 365 admin center instead of Intune. To deregister an Autopilot device from the Microsoft 365 admin center:

1. Sign into to the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com/)
1. Navigate to **Devices** > **Autopilot**.
1. Select the device to be deregistered and then select **Delete device**.

### Deregister from Autopilot in Microsoft Partner Center (MPC)

To deregister an Autopilot device from the Microsoft Partner Center (MPC), a CSP would:

1. Log into the Microsoft Partner Center (MPC).
2. Navigate to **Customer** > **Devices**.
3. Select the device to be deregistered and then select **Delete device**.

   ![Screenshot of delete device](../images/devices.png)

Partners deregistering a device from Autopilot in Microsoft Partner Center (MPC) only deregisters the device from Autopilot. It doesn't perform any of the following actions:

- Unenroll the device from the MDM (Intune)
- Disjoin the device from Microsoft Entra ID

For the reasons listed above, the OEM or CSP should work with the customer IT administrators to have the device fully removed by following the steps in the [Deregister a device](#deregister-a-device) section.

An OEM or CSP that has integrated the OEM Direct APIs can also deregister a device with the **AutopilotDeviceRegistration** API. Make sure the **TenantID** and **TenantDomain** fields are left blank.

> [!NOTE]
>
> If an admin registered a device via another portal other than the Microsoft Partner Center (MPC) such as Intune or Microsoft 365 admin center, the device doesn't show up in Microsoft Partner Center (MPC). For a partner to register a device in the Microsoft Partner Center (MPC), the devices first needs to be deregistered using the steps outlined in the [Deregister a device](#deregister-a-device) section.
