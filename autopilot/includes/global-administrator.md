The [Microsoft Entra Global Administrator](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/privileged-roles-permissions) role is a highly privileged role that should only be used when another role can't be used. This feature requires the Global Administrator role. For other features, Microsoft recommends using roles with the fewest permissions.
