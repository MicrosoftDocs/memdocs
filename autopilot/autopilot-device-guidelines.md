# Windows Autopilot device guidelines

## Hardware and firmware best practice guidelines for Windows Autopilot

All devices using Windows Autopilot should meet the minimum hardware requirements for Windows. For more information, see:

- [Find Windows 11 specs, features, and computer requirements](https://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows-11-specifications).
- [How to Find Windows 10 Computer Specifications & Systems Requirements](https://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows-10-specifications).
- [Windows minimum hardware requirements](/windows-hardware/design/minimum/minimum-hardware-requirements-overview).
- [Windows 11 requirements](/windows/whats-new/windows-11-requirements).

The following best practices ensure that devices can easily be provisioned as part of the Windows Autopilot deployment process:

- TPM 2.0 is enabled and in a good state on devices intended for Windows Autopilot self-deploying mode. The TPM shouldn't be in the **Reduced Functionality Mode** state.

- The OEM should provision either of the following information into the [SMBIOS fields](/windows-hardware/drivers/bringup/smbios). The information should follow Microsoft specifications (Manufacturer, Product Name, and Serial Number stored in SMBIOS Type 1 04h, Type 1 05h, and Type 1 07h).

  - Unique tuple info (SmbiosSystemManufacturer, SmbiosSystemProductName, SmbiosSystemSerialNumber)

  - PKID + SmbiosSystemSerialNumber

- Before an OEM ships devices to an Autopilot customer or channel partner, they should upload 4K Hardware Hashes to Microsoft by using the CBR report. The hashes should be collected using the OA3 Tool RS3+ run in Audit mode on full OS.

- Microsoft requires that OEM shipping drivers get published to Windows Update within 30 days of the CBR submission date. System firmware and driver updates are published to Windows Update within 14 days.

- The OEM ensures that the PKID provisioned in the SMBIOS is passed on to the channel.

- When using a VM for Autopilot testing, assign at least 2 processors and 4gb of memory.

## Software best practice guidelines for Windows Autopilot

- The Windows Autopilot device should be preinstalled with only a Windows base image plus drivers.

- Licensed versions of Office, such as [Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise](/deployoffice/about-office-365-proplus-in-the-enterprise), can be preinstalled.

- Unless explicitly requested by the customer, no other preinstalled software should be included.

  - Per OEM Policy, Windows features, including built-in apps, shouldn't be disabled or removed.
