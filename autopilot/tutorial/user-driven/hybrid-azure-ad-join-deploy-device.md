For an overview of the Windows Autopilot user-driven Microsoft Entra hybrid join workflow, see [Windows Autopilot user-driven Microsoft Entra hybrid join overview](hybrid-azure-ad-join-workflow.md#workflow).

## Deploy the device

Once all of the configurations for the Windows Autopilot user-driven Microsoft Entra hybrid join deployment are completed in Intune and in Microsoft Entra ID, the next step is to start the Autopilot deployment process on the device. If desired, deploy any additional applications and policies that should run during the Autopilot deployment to a device group that the device is a member of.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> The Microsoft Entra hybrid join process requires connectivity to both the Internet and a domain controller. If the connected network doesn't have connectivity to a domain controller, a solution such as a VPN that has connectivity to a domain controller is required.

To start the Autopilot deployment process on the device, acquire a device that is part of the device group created in the previous [Create a device group](hybrid-azure-ad-join-device-group.md) step. Once the device is acquired, follow these steps:

[!INCLUDE [Network connectivity](../includes/network-connectivity.md)]

4. Once the Autopilot process begins, the Microsoft Entra sign-in page appears. At the Microsoft Entra sign-in page, if a user was assigned to the device, their username might be pre-populated in this screen. Enter the Microsoft Entra credentials for the user.

   If on-premises domain end-user credentials are different from Microsoft Entra end-user credentials, make sure that **Microsoft Entra end-user credentials** are used to sign in at this step. Don't use on-premises credentials to sign in at this step.

5. Once the credentials are entered, select **Next** (Windows 10) or **Sign in** (Windows 11) to sign in. If necessary, proceed through the multi-factor authentication (MFA) screens.

6. After authenticating with Microsoft Entra ID, the Enrollment Status Page (ESP) appears. The ESP displays progress during the provisioning process across three phases:

   - **Device preparation** (Device ESP)
   - **Device setup** (Device ESP)
   - **Account setup** (User ESP)

    The first two phases of **Device preparation** and **Device setup** are part of the Device ESP while the final phase of **Account setup** is part of the User ESP.

7. Once the **Device setup** phase of the Device ESP is complete, user ESP begins and the **User setup** phase starts. The ESP is temporarily dismissed and the Windows sign-on screen appears:

   1. Enter the keystroke <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>ALT</kbd> + <kbd>DEL</kbd> to initiate Windows sign-on.

   1. Enter the on-premises domain credentials for the end-user.

      If on-premises domain end-user credentials are different from Microsoft Entra end-user credentials, make sure that the **on-premises domain end-user credentials** are used to sign into the device at this step. Don't use the Microsoft Entra end-user credentials to attempt to sign into the device at this step.

   1. Select <kbd>ENTER</kbd> on the keyboard to sign the end-user into the device.

8. The Enrollment Status Page (ESP) appears again and the **Account setup** phase of the user ESP continues.

   1. After a short period of time, the Microsoft Entra sign-in page might appear. Sign in with the end-user's Microsoft Entra credentials.

      If on-premises domain end-user credentials are different from Microsoft Entra end-user credentials, make sure that **Microsoft Entra end-user credentials** are used to sign in at this step. Don't use on-premises credentials to sign in at this step.

   1. Once the credentials are entered, select **Next**.

   1. The **Stay signed in to all your apps** screen appears. Make sure that the option **Allow my organization to manage my device** is selected, and then select **OK**.

   1. The **You're all set!** screen appears. Select **Done**.

      > [!NOTE]
      >
      > Under certain circumstances, the Microsoft Entra sign-in and subsequent pages might not appear and the end-user might be automatically signed into Microsoft Entra ID. For example, if using [Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS)](/windows-server/identity/active-directory-federation-services) and [single sign-on (SSO)](/windows-server/identity/ad-fs/operations/ad-fs-single-sign-on-settings). If the end-user is automatically signed into Microsoft Entra ID, then the Autopilot deployment will proceed on to the next step automatically.

9. Once **Account setup** and the user ESP process completes, the provisioning process completes and the ESP finishes. Select the **Sign out** button to dismiss the ESP and go to the Windows sign-on screen. At this point, the end-user can sign into the device using their on-premises domain end-user credentials and start using the device.
