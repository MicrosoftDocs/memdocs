- Step 5: [Create and assign Windows Autopilot profile](self-deploying-autopilot-profile.md)
- Step 6: [Deploy the device](self-deploying-deploy-device.md)

For an overview of the Windows Autopilot self-deploying mode workflow, see [Windows Autopilot self-deploying overview](self-deploying-workflow.md#workflow).

> [!NOTE]

> If an ESP is already configured, assigned, and uses the same settings for the Windows Autopilot self-deploying mode scenario, skip this step and move on to [Step 5: Create and assign Windows Autopilot profile](self-deploying-autopilot-profile.md).
