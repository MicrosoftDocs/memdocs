# Self-deploying mode: Configure and assign the Enrollment Status Page (ESP)

Autopilot self-deploying mode steps:

- Step 1: [Set up Windows automatic Intune enrollment](self-deploying-automatic-enrollment.md)
- Step 2: [Register devices as Autopilot devices](self-deploying-register-device.md)
- Step 3: [Create a device group](self-deploying-device-group.md)

> [!div class="checklist"]
>
> **Step 4: Configure and assign Autopilot Enrollment Status Page (ESP)**

- Step 5: [Create and assign Autopilot profile](self-deploying-autopilot-profile.md)
- Step 6: [Deploy the device](self-deploying-deploy-device.md)

For an overview of the Windows Autopilot self-deploying mode workflow, see [Windows Autopilot self-deploying overview](self-deploying-workflow.md#workflow).

> [!NOTE]
>
> If an ESP is already configured, assigned, and uses the same settings for the Windows Autopilot self-deploying mode scenario, skip this step and move on to [Step 5: Create and assign Autopilot profile](self-deploying-autopilot-profile.md).
