# Self-deploying mode: Create and assign self-deploying Windows Autopilot profile

Windows Autopilot self-deploying mode steps:

- Step 1: [Set up Windows automatic Intune enrollment](self-deploying-automatic-enrollment.md)
- Step 2: [Register devices as Windows Autopilot devices](self-deploying-register-device.md)
- Step 3: [Create a device group](self-deploying-device-group.md)
- Step 4: [Configure and assign Windows Autopilot Enrollment Status Page (ESP)](self-deploying-esp.md)

> [!div class="checklist"]
>
> - **Step 5: Create and assign Windows Autopilot profile**

- Step 6: [Deploy the device](self-deploying-deploy-device.md)

For an overview of the Windows Autopilot self-deploying mode workflow, see [Windows Autopilot self-deploying overview](self-deploying-workflow.md#workflow).

## Create and assign self-deploying Windows Autopilot profile

The Windows Autopilot profile specifies how the device is configured during Windows Setup and what is shown during the out-of-box experience (OOBE).

> [!TIP]
>
> For Configuration Manager admins, the Windows Autopilot profile is similar to some of the configuration that takes place during a task sequence via an `unattend.xml` file. The `unattend.xml` file is configured during the **Apply Windows Settings** and **Apply Network Settings** steps. Note however that Windows Autopilot doesn't use `unattend.xml` files.

To create a self-deploying mode Windows Autopilot profile, follow these steps:

[!INCLUDE [Windows Autopilot profiles before steps](../includes/autopilot-profile-steps-before.md)]

8. In the **Out-of-box experience (OOBE)** page:

      - For **Deployment mode**, select **Self-Deploying**.

      - **Join to Microsoft Entra ID as** defaults to **Microsoft Entra joined**, is greyed out, and can't be changed. Only **Microsoft Entra joined** is available because self-deploying mode only supports Microsoft Entra join. Self-deploying modes doesn't support Microsoft Entra hybrid join.

      - **Microsoft Software License Terms** defaults to **Hide**, is greyed out, and can't be changed.

      - **Privacy settings** defaults to **Hide**, is greyed out, and can't be changed.

      - **Hide change account options** defaults to **Hide**, is greyed out, and can't be changed.

      - **User account type**  defaults to **Standard**, is greyed out, and can't be changed.

      - For **Language (Region)**, select **Operating system default** to use the default language for the operating system being configured. If another language is desired, select the desired language from the drop-down list.

      - For **Automatically configure keyboard**, select **Yes** to skip the keyboard selection page.

        > [!NOTE]
        >
        > If users should select their keyboard layout, then select **No** instead. However, the purpose of Windows Autopilot self-deploying mode is to deploy a device with minimal to no user interaction. Setting **Automatically configure keyboard** to **No** requires additional user interaction.

      - For **Apply device name template**, select **No**. Alternatively, **Yes** can be chosen to apply a device name template. Be aware of the following if the name template is selected to **Yes**:

        - Names must be 15 characters or less, and can have letters, numbers, and hyphens.
        - Names can't be all numbers.
        - Use the [%SERIAL% macro](/windows/client-management/mdm/accounts-csp) to add a hardware-specific serial number.
        - Use the [%RAND:x% macro](/windows/client-management/mdm/accounts-csp) to add a random string of numbers, where x equals the number of digits to add.

      > [!NOTE]
      >
      > If the language/region and keyboard screens are set to hidden, they might still be displayed if there's no network connectivity at the start of the Windows Autopilot deployment. When there's no network connectivity at the start of the deployment, the Windows Autopilot profile, where the settings to hide these screens is defined, hasn't downloaded yet. Once network connectivity is established, the Windows Autopilot profile is downloaded and any additional screen settings should work as expected.
