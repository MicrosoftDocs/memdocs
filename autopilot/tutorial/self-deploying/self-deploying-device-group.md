# Self-deploying mode: Create a device group

Autopilot self-deploying mode steps:

- Step 1: [Set up Windows automatic Intune enrollment](self-deploying-automatic-enrollment.md)
- Step 2: [Register devices as Autopilot devices](self-deploying-register-device.md)

> [!div class="checklist"]
>
> - **Step 3: Create a device group**

- Step 4: [Configure and assign Autopilot Enrollment Status Page (ESP)](self-deploying-esp.md)
- Step 5: [Create and assign Autopilot profile](self-deploying-autopilot-profile.md)
- Step 6: [Deploy the device](self-deploying-deploy-device.md)

For an overview of the Windows Autopilot self-deploying mode workflow, see [Windows Autopilot self-deploying overview](self-deploying-workflow.md#workflow).

> [!NOTE]
>
> If device groups are already created, skip this step and move on to [Step 4: Configure and assign Autopilot Enrollment Status Page (ESP)](self-deploying-esp.md). However, if deploying multiple different Autopilot scenarios to different devices, separate device groups are required for each Autopilot scenario.
