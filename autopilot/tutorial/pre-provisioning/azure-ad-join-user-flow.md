# Pre-provision Microsoft Entra join: User flow

Windows Autopilot for pre-provisioned deployment Microsoft Entra join steps:

- Step 1: [Set up Windows automatic Intune enrollment](azure-ad-join-automatic-enrollment.md)
- Step 2: [Allow users to join devices to Microsoft Entra ID](azure-ad-join-allow-users-to-join.md)
- Step 3: [Register devices as Autopilot devices](azure-ad-join-register-device.md)
- Step 4: [Create a device group](azure-ad-join-device-group.md)
- Step 5: [Configure and assign Autopilot Enrollment Status Page (ESP)](azure-ad-join-esp.md)
- Step 6: [Create and assign Autopilot profile](azure-ad-join-autopilot-profile.md)
- Step 7: [Assign Autopilot device to a user (optional)](azure-ad-join-assign-device-to-user.md)
- Step 8: [Technician flow](azure-ad-join-technician-flow.md)

For an overview of the Windows Autopilot for pre-provisioned deployment Microsoft Entra join workflow, see [Windows Autopilot for pre-provisioned deployment Microsoft Entra join overview](azure-ad-join-workflow.md#workflow).

## User flow

Once the technician flow step of the pre-provisioning process completes successfully and the device is resealed, the device can be delivered to the end-user. The end-user then completes the normal Windows Autopilot user-driven process. This final step is know as the user flow and involves the following steps:

[!INCLUDE [Network connectivity](../includes/network-connectivity.md)]

4. Once the Autopilot process begins, the Microsoft Entra sign-in page appears. At the Microsoft Entra sign-in page, if a user was assigned to the device, their username might be pre-populated in this screen. Enter the Microsoft Entra credentials for the user and then select **Next** (Windows 10) or **Sign in** (Windows 11) to sign in. If necessary, proceed through the multi-factor authentication (MFA) screens.

5. After authenticating with Microsoft Entra ID, the Enrollment Status Page (ESP) appears. The Enrollment Status Page (ESP) appears. The Enrollment Status Page (ESP) displays progress during the provisioning process across three phases:

   - **Device preparation** (Device ESP)
   - **Device setup** (Device ESP)
   - **Account setup** (User ESP)

    The first two phases of **Device preparation** and **Device setup** are part of the Device ESP while the final phase of **Account setup** is part of the User ESP.

    For the user flow of Windows Autopilot for pre-provisioned deployment, the **Device setup** phase of the Device ESP and the **Account setup** phase of the User ESP runs. The **Device preparation** phase of the Device ESP doesn't run during the user flow since it already ran during the [Technician flow](azure-ad-join-technician-flow.md).

    The **Device setup** phase of the Device ESP runs again during the user flow in case any new or additional policies or applications assigned to the device became available between the technician flow phase and the user flow phase.

6. Once **Account setup** and the user ESP process completes, the provisioning process completes, the ESP finishes, and the desktop appears. At this point, the end-user can start using the device.
