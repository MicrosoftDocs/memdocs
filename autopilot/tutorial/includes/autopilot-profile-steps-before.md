      > [!NOTE]
      >
      > Microsoft recommends setting the option **Convert all targeted devices to Autopilot** to **Yes**. This tutorial concentrates on new devices where the device is manually imported as an Autopilot device using the hardware hash. However, this option can be helpful when assigning Autopilot profiles to device groups that contain existing devices. For example, this option is helpful when using the [Windows Autopilot for existing devices](../existing-devices/existing-devices-workflow.md) scenario. With Windows Autopilot for existing devices, existing devices might need to be registered as an Autopilot device after the Autopilot deployment completes. For more information, see [Register device for Windows Autopilot](../existing-devices/register-device.md).
