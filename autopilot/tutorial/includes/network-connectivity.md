1. If a wired network connection is available, connect the device to the wired network connection.

1. Power on the device.

1. Once the device boots up, one of two things occurs depending on the state of network connectivity:

   - If the device is connected to a wired network and has network connectivity, the device might reboot to apply critical security updates (if available or applicable). After the reboot to apply critical security updates, the Autopilot process begins.

   - If the device isn't connected to a wired network or if it doesn't have network connectivity, it prompts to connect to a network. Connectivity to the Internet is required:

     1. The out-of-box experience (OOBE) begins and a screen asking for a country or region appears. Select the appropriate country or region, and then select **Yes**.

     1. The keyboard screen appears to select a keyboard layout. Select the appropriate keyboard layout, and then select **Yes**.

     1. An additional keyboard layouts screen appears. If needed, select additional keyboard layouts via **Add layout**, or select **Skip** if no additional keyboard layouts are needed.

         > [!NOTE]
         >
         > When there's no network connectivity, the device can't download the Autopilot profile to know what country/region and keyboard settings to use. For this reason, when there's no network connectivity, the country/region and keyboard screens appear even if these screens are set to hidden in the Autopilot profile. These settings need to be specified in these screens in order for the network connectivity screens that follow to work properly.

     1. The **Let's connect you to a network** screen appears. At this screen, either plug the device into a wired network (if available), or select and connect to a wireless Wi-Fi network.

     1. Once network connectivity is established, the **Next** button should become available. Select **Next**.

     1. At this point, the device might reboot to apply critical security updates (if available or applicable). After the reboot to apply critical security updates, the Autopilot process begins.
