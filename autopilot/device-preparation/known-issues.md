## Known issues

## Security group membership update failures might lead to non-compliant devices

Date added: *September 27, 2024*

If security groups aren't properly configured in Microsoft Intune, devices might lose compliance and be left in an unsecured state. The following are potential reasons for security group membership failures:

- **Retry failures**: Security group membership updates might not succeed during retry windows, leading to delays in group updates.

- **Static to dynamic group changes**: After the Windows Autopilot device preparation profiles are configured, changing a security group from static to dynamic could cause failures.

- **Owner removal**: If the **Intune Provisioning Client** service principal is removed as an owner of a configured security group, updates might fail.

- **Group deletion**: If a configured security group is deleted and devices are deployed before Microsoft Intune detects the deletion, security configurations might fail to apply.

To mitigate the issue, follow these steps:

1. **Validate security group configuration before provisioning**:

   - Ensure the correct security group is selected within the Microsoft Intune admin center or the Microsoft Entra admin center.
   - The security group should be configured within the Windows Autopilot device preparation profile.
   - The group shouldn't be assignable to other groups.
   - The **Intune Provisioning Client** service principal should be an owner of the group.

1. **Manually fix the provisioned devices**:

   - If devices are already deployed or the security group isn't applicable, manually add the affected devices to the correct security group.

Security group membership failures can be prevented by following these steps, ensuring devices remain compliant and secure.

## Deployment fails for devices not in the Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) time zone

Date added: *July 8, 2024* <br>
Date updated: *July 23, 2024*

Autopilot device preparation deployments fail when devices aren't in the UTC time zone. The issue is being investigated.

As a workaround, customers can manually set the time zone in OOBE via Windows PowerShell until the issue is resolved:

```powershell
Set-TimeZone -Id "UTC"
```

**This issue was resolved in July 2024.**

## BitLocker encryption defaults to 128-bit when 256-bit encryption is configured

Date added: *July 8, 2024*

In some Windows Autopilot device preparation deployments, BitLocker encryption may default to 128-bit even though the admin configured 256-bit encryption due to a known race condition. The issue is being investigated. Microsoft recommends that customers who need 256-bit BitLocker encryption wait for the issue to be resolved before trying to use Windows Autopilot device preparation.

## Windows Autopilot device preparation policy shows 0 groups assigned

Date added: *June 18, 2024* <br>
Date updated: *July 23, 2024*

There's a known issue that the Windows Autopilot device preparation policy shows **0 groups assigned** even when:

- An assigned device security group was properly added to the policy.
- The **Intune Provisioning Client** service principal with AppID of **f1346770-5b25-470b-88bd-d5744ab7952c** is the owner of the device security group specified in the policy.

The issue is being investigated. As a workaround, create a new assigned device security group with the **Intune Provisioning Client** service principal with AppID of **f1346770-5b25-470b-88bd-d5744ab7952c** as the owner, and then assign the new device group to the Windows Autopilot device preparation policy. For more information on creating the assigned device group, see [Create a device group](tutorial/user-driven/entra-join-device-group.md#create-a-device-group).

**This issue was resolved in July 2024.**

## Unable to assign Windows Autopilot device preparation policy to user group

Date added: *June 18, 2024* <br>
Date updated: *July 23, 2024*

There's a known issue where an administrator might not be able to assign the Windows Autopilot device preparation policy to a user group. When the issue occurs, the following error might occur:

> **Unable to save group assignment for <policy_name>. You do not have permission to save these assignments.**

The issue is being investigated. As a workaround, add the following additional role-based access control (RBAC) permission for the Windows Autopilot device preparation administrator role:

- **Device configurations**
  - Assign

For more information, see [Required RBAC permissions](requirements.md?tabs=rbac#required-rbac-permissions).

> [!NOTE]
> The [Required RBAC permissions](requirements.md?tabs=rbac#required-rbac-permissions) article doesn't list the **Device configurations** - **Assign** permission. This permission requirement is only temporary until the issue is resolved. However, the article can be used as a guide on how to properly add this permission.
**This issue was resolved in July 2024.**

### Device is stuck at 100% during the out-of-box experience (OOBE)

Date added: *June 3, 2024*

If during Windows Autopilot device preparation deployment a device gets stuck at 100% during the out-of-box experience (OOBE), the end-user needs to manually restart the device for the deployment to continue. This issue is a known issue and a fix is being worked on.

### Object with AppID of f1346770-5b25-470b-88bd-d5744ab7952c displays as Intune Autopilot ConfidentialClient

Date added: *June 3, 2024*

In some tenants, when trying to set the owner of the device group used in the Windows Autopilot device preparation policy, the service principal with AppID of **f1346770-5b25-470b-88bd-d5744ab7952c** displays as **Intune Autopilot ConfidentialClient** instead of **Intune Provisioning Client**. As long as the service principal has an AppID of **f1346770-5b25-470b-88bd-d5744ab7952c**, it's the correct service principal and can be selected.

### Conflict between Microsoft Entra ID and Windows Autopilot device preparation local administrator setting

Date added: *June 3, 2024*

There's a compatibility problem between the Windows Autopilot device preparation policy **User account type** setting and the Microsoft Entra ID **Local administrator settings**. Specifically, when the Windows Autopilot device preparation policy **User account type** setting is set to **Standard user** and the Microsoft Entra ID setting **Registering user is added as local administrator on the device during Microsoft Entra join (Preview)** under **Local administrator settings** is set to either **Selected** or **None**, provisioning gets skipped during a Windows Autopilot device preparation deployment. This settings conflict leads to a scenario where users could reach the desktop without having the expected applications installed. The Microsoft Entra ID **Local administrator settings** can be found by signing into the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) and navigating to **Microsoft Entra ID** > **Manage | Devices** > **Manage | Devices settings**.

Until the issue is fixed, for users to be standard non-administrators on their device, make sure that the settings are set to one of the following three setting combinations:

- **Standard user option 1**
  - The Microsoft Entra ID **Local administrator settings** is set to **None**.
  - The Windows Autopilot device preparation policy **User account type** setting is set to **Administrator**.

- **Standard user option 2**
  - The Microsoft Entra ID **Local administrator settings** is set to **Selected** and the standard non-administrator users aren't selected.
  - The Windows Autopilot device preparation policy **User account type** setting is set to **Administrator**.

- **Standard user option 3**
  - The Microsoft Entra ID **Local administrator settings** is set to **All**.
  - The Windows Autopilot device preparation policy **User account type** is set to **Standard user**.

In all three cases, the end result is that the user is a standard non-administrative user on the device.

If the intention is for the user to be a local administrator user on the device, make sure that the settings are set to one of the following two setting combinations:

- **Administrator user option 1**
  - The Microsoft Entra ID **Local administrator settings** is set to **All**.
  - The Windows Autopilot device preparation policy **User account type** setting is set to **Administrator**.

- **Administrator user option 2**
  - The Microsoft Entra ID **Local administrator settings** is set to **Selected** and the administrator users are selected.
  - The Windows Autopilot device preparation policy **User account type** setting is set to **Administrator**.
