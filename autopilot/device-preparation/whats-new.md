## Installation of monthly security update releases during Windows Autopilot device preparation

Date added: *September 3, 2025*<br>
Date updated: *September 9, 2025*

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> As of September 9, 2025, this capability is delayed to help ensure delivery of the best possible experience. Automatic installation of monthly security update isn't available yet. This post will be updated with a revised timeline as soon as it's available.

[Monthly security update releases](/windows/deployment/update/release-cycle#monthly-security-update-release), also known as Windows quality updates, are installed during a Windows Autopilot device preparation deployment as part of the Windows out-of-box experience (OOBE). The monthly security update releases are installed after the device preparation page completes. These updates can't be disabled for Windows Autopilot device preparation deployments. Installation of monthly security update releases during OOBE normally adds 20-40 minutes to the provisioning process. Installation of monthly security update releases also might require restarts.

More details regarding automatic installation of monthly security update releases can be found in the article [Install Windows monthly security update releases](/intune/intune-service/enrollment/windows-enrollment-status#install-windows-monthly-security-update-releases). However, this article is in regards to using the Enrollment Status Page (ESP) with Windows Autopilot. Windows Autopilot device preparation doesn't use the ESP, so the **Install Windows quality updates (might restart the device)** setting mentioned in this article isn't applicable to Windows Autopilot device preparation.

For more information, see [Get ready for Windows quality updates out of the box](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/windows-itpro-blog/get-ready-for-windows-quality-updates-out-of-the-box/4434498).

## Deliver Enterprise App Catalog (EAM) apps during Autopilot device preparation

Date added: *June 26, 2025*

Autopilot device preparation now supports Enterprise App Catalog apps. Microsoft Intune Enterprise App Management enables IT admins to easily manage applications from the Enterprise App Catalog. With Intune's 2506 release, you can now select apps from the Enterprise App Catalog in the device preparation policy. This allows you to ensure those apps are delivered before the user can access the desktop.

For related information, see [Add an Enterprise App Catalog app to Microsoft Intune](/intune/intune-service/apps/apps-add-enterprise-app).

## Windows Autopilot device preparation in automatic mode for Windows 365 Frontline in shared mode is in public preview

Date added: *April 2, 2025*

We've introduced a new flow for Windows Autopilot device preparation which can be used to provision [Windows 365 Frontline in shared mode](/windows-365/enterprise/introduction-windows-365-frontline). Admins can now choose **Automatic** when creating a Windows Autopilot device preparation policy to prepare a policy for Cloud PCs. The policy can then be included in the Cloud PC provisioning policy to ensure the policy is assigned to all Cloud PCs after they're created. The new Automatic policy allows admins to select up to 10 apps and up to 10 scripts which are delivered before a user accesses the Cloud PC. Deployments can then be monitored in the [Windows Autopilot device preparation deployment report](reporting-monitoring.md).

With the new mode, admins can make sure their Cloud PCs are secured with required software and scripts before the end user logs in!

For a tutorial on Windows Autopilot device preparation in automatic mode for Windows 365, see [Step by step tutorial for Windows Autopilot device preparation in automatic mode for Windows 365 in Intune](tutorial/automatic/automatic-workflow.md).
