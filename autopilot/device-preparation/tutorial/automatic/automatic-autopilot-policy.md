## Create an automatic mode for Windows 365 Windows Autopilot device preparation policy

The Windows Autopilot policy specifies how the device is configured during Windows Setup and what is shown during the out-of-box experience (OOBE).

To create an automatic mode for Windows 365 Windows Autopilot device preparation policy, follow these steps:

1. Sign into the [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431).

1. In the **Home** screen, select **Devices** in the left hand pane.

1. In the **Devices | Overview** screen, under **By platform**, select **Windows**.

1. In the **Windows | Windows enrollment** screen, under **Windows Autopilot device preparation**, select **Device preparation policies**.

1. In the **Device preparation policies** screen, select **Create**, and then select **Automatic (Preview)**.

1. The **Create profile** screen opens. In the **Introduction** page, select **Next**.

1. In the **Basics** page:

   1. In the **Name** text box, enter a name for the Windows Autopilot device preparation policy.

   1. In the **Description** text box, if desired, enter a description for the Windows Autopilot device preparation policy.

   1. Once a name and description is entered, select **Next**.

1. In the **Device group** page, select the **Search by group name..** box, and then either select or search for the device group created in [Step 3: Create an assigned device group](automatic-device-group.md). Once the correct device group is selected, select **Next**.

1. In the **Configuration settings** page:

   1. The **Apps** section allows selection of up to 10 managed applications reference with the deployment. The applications specified here should be the essential applications that should be installed on the device before the end-user can start using the device. Under the **Apps** section:

      > [!IMPORTANT]
      >
      > The applications selected in this setting should be assigned to the device security group previously specified in the **Device group** page. If applicable, the applications should also be configured to install in the **System** context since it's installed during OOBE when no user is signed in.

      > [!NOTE]
      >
      > The following types of applications are supported for use with Windows Autopilot device preparation:
      >
      > - [Line-of-business (LOB)](/mem/intune-service/apps/lob-apps-windows).
      > - [Win32](/mem/intune-service/apps/apps-win32-prepare).
      > - [Microsoft Store](/mem/intune-service/apps/store-apps-microsoft) - only Microsoft Store apps that support WinGet are supported.
      > - [Microsoft 365](/mem/intune-service/apps/apps-add-office365).
      >
      > In addition, Windows Autopilot device preparation supports deploying both Win32 and line-of-business (LOB) applications in the same deployment.

   1. The **Scripts** section allows selection of up to 10 PowerShell scripts to install during the deployment. The PowerShell scripts specified here should be the essential PowerShell scripts that should run on the device before the end-user can start using the device. Under the **Scripts** section:

For more information about scope tags, see [Use role-based access control and scope tags for distributed IT](/mem/intune-service/fundamentals/scope-tags).

1. In the **Review + create** page, review all settings to make sure they're all correct. Once everything is verified, select **Save** to finish creating the Windows Autopilot device preparation policy.

> [!TIP]
>
> When a Windows Autopilot device preparation policy for automatic mode is created, there's no **Assignments** page for assigning the policy. Instead, the assignment is taken care of when creating the Cloud PC provisioning policy during [Step 5: Create a Cloud PC provisioning policy](automatic-cloud-pc-provisioning-policy.md).
